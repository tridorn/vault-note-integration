# **ðŸ“ˆ Long-Term Boot-Up Roadmap: Developing a Diversified Trading Structure**
### **Duration:** ~24-36 months (scalable based on progress)  
This roadmap is designed in **phases**, each focusing on building key trading skills across **futures, options, and crypto derivatives**. It prioritizes risk control, gradual scaling, and diversification of strategies.

---

### **Phase 1: Foundations and Paper Trading (~0-3 Months)**  
**Goal:** Develop foundational knowledge of all three markets, practice risk management, and refine initial strategies through paper trading.

#### **1. Key Activities**  
- **Futures:**  
  - Practice intraday trading (pullbacks, trend continuation) using **micro futures (MES, MNQ)** on a demo account.  
  - Focus on **VWAP, 20-EMA, and RSI-based setups.**  

- **Options:**  
  - Learn basic options strategies like **long calls/puts** and **covered calls** on **tech stocks and ETFs**.  
  - Paper trade options with 1-2 week expiry to understand time decay and price sensitivity.  

- **Crypto Derivatives:**  
  - Practice **small-scale breakout trades** or **mean reversion scalps** on demo accounts.  
  - Study how crypto reacts to global news and sentiment shifts.  

#### **2. Core Skills to Develop:**  
- Setting proper stop-losses and take-profits.  
- Managing emotions through consistent journaling.  
- Understanding how leverage affects P&L across all three markets.

#### **3. Weekly Routine Example:**  
| **Day**       | **Primary Focus**               | **Key Activity**                          |
|---------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Mon-Wed       | Futures                         | Intraday trading using VWAP pullbacks     |

| Weekend       | Crypto (BTC/ETH on demo)        | Test breakout trades and momentum scalping|

ðŸŽ¯ **Milestone:** Gain confidence in executing trades and understanding leverage. Aim to **limit demo account losses to <10%**.

---

### **Phase 2: Small-Scale Live Trading (~3-6 Months)**  
**Goal:** Transition to **live trading with small positions** while maintaining tight risk management.

#### **1. Key Activities**  
- **Futures:**  
  - Start trading **micro contracts** live (MES, MNQ).  
  - Limit risk to **1% of capital per trade** with small position sizes (1-2 contracts).  

- **Options:**  
  - Trade liquid options on **AAPL, MSFT, QQQ**, starting with **1-2 contracts per trade**.  
  - Focus on **short-term directional plays (1-2 week expiries)** around news or technical setups.  

- **Crypto Derivatives:**  
  - Trade **BTC or ETH perpetual futures** with minimal leverage (2-3x).  
  - Apply tight stop-losses to avoid large losses during volatile price moves.

#### **2. Core Skills to Develop:**  
- Analyzing win rates and refining trade entry/exit criteria.  
- Controlling drawdowns through position sizing.  
- Understanding the impact of real-world emotions when trading live.

#### **3. Weekly Routine Example:**  
| **Day**       | **Primary Focus**               | **Key Activity**                          |
|---------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Mon-Wed       | Live futures (micro contracts)  | VWAP or EMA-based trend trades            |
| Thu-Fri       | Live options (tech stocks)      | Directional trades on AAPL/QQQ options    |
| Weekend       | Small crypto trades (BTC/ETH)   | Momentum scalping with tight stops        |

ðŸŽ¯ **Milestone:** End Phase 2 with **small, consistent gains or breakeven performance**. Monitor **max drawdowns (no more than 5-10%)**.

---

### **Phase 3: Scaling Positions and Expanding Markets (~6-12 Months)**  
**Goal:** Increase position sizes and gradually expand to additional markets while maintaining a diversified approach.

#### **1. Key Activities**  
- **Futures:**  
  - Gradually scale up to **mini contracts (ES, NQ)** if profitable with micro contracts.  
  - Introduce **commodity futures** like crude oil (CL) or gold (GC) to diversify exposure.  

- **Options:**  
  - Trade **vertical spreads** (bull call/bear put spreads) to manage risk while scaling positions.  
  - Begin trading options around **earnings reports and major events** for high volatility opportunities.  

- **Crypto Derivatives:**  
  - Expand to **altcoins like SOL or MATIC**, but keep position sizes small.  
  - Consider swing trading larger timeframes (1-5 days) instead of just intraday scalping.  

#### **2. Core Skills to Develop:**  
- Scaling positions while maintaining risk control.  
- Managing multiple trades across different markets simultaneously.  
- Optimizing strategy for each market (e.g., different indicators for futures vs. crypto).

ðŸŽ¯ **Milestone:** Build a consistent win rate of **50-60% or higher** with a **profit factor of at least 1.5**. No single market should dominate the portfolioâ€™s performance.

---

### **Phase 4: Refinement and Advanced Strategy Development (~12-24 Months)**  
**Goal:** Expand your arsenal of strategies (e.g., advanced options spreads, volatility plays) while refining risk management and capital allocation.

#### **1. Key Activities**

  - Consider overnight holds for swing trades with strong macroeconomic catalysts.

  - Trade more complex strategies like **straddles, strangles, and iron condors**.  
  - Use options to hedge large futures or crypto positions.

| Thu-Fri       | Advanced options strategies     | Straddles/iron condors on QQQ or TSLA     |
| Weekend       | Crypto derivatives              | Hedging or speculative altcoin trades     |

ðŸŽ¯ **Milestone:** Achieve **consistent monthly returns (3-5%)** and maintain **max drawdowns below 10%**. Diversify trades across multiple time horizons.

---

### **Phase 5: Long-Term Portfolio Management (~24+ Months)**
**Goal:** Transition from day-to-day trading to managing a **multi-market portfolio**, balancing short-term and long-term trades.

#### **1. Core Focus:**  
- Allocate capital across futures, options, and crypto derivatives based on market conditions.  
- Maintain a core portfolio (e.g., long-term crypto holdings) alongside active trades.
