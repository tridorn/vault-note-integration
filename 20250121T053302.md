Victorian estates often reflected the era's broad range of interests, from scientific exploration and botany to elaborate social customs and spiritualism. The Victorians were fascinated with discovery, refinement, and aesthetic detail, resulting in estates rich with eclectic features that still enchant. Here are some quintessential Victorian fascinations you might incorporate into your estate:

---

### **2. The Library and Curiosity Cabinet**

### **9. The Formal Gardens with Parterres and Mazes**
