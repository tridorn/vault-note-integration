**Correction:** "I checked online (briefly) and prices seemed quite high for taking in offers for website development." → _I've observed that development outsourcing prices--despite originating from low-cost regions--appear globally indexed and higher than expected. What is the structurally sound method for handling outsourcing in this context?_

### Strategic Framing

You are encountering the **commoditisation trap of freelancer platforms**. Once a freelancer learns the Western pricing baseline, they anchor to it--**regardless of their cost base**. This eliminates your margin unless you control three levers:

1. **Scope (simplify and productise the offer)**

2. **Labor pool (bypass market-priced freelancers)**

3. **System (manage work through process, not trust)**

You don't need _cheap developers_. You need a **repeatable labor unit** that can deliver your **standardised offer** within a cost structure that preserves **gross margins of 60--70%**.
* * *

### The Real Problem

Freelancer platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, etc. operate on **global pricing dynamics**:

- Developers mimic Western pricing after a few projects.
- Quality contractors raise prices fast.
- You're treated like a one-off client unless your agency has scale.
- No switching cost = no loyalty = inconsistent quality.

To preserve margin **and** control, you need to **leave the open market and build a captive bench**.
* * *

### Recommended Approach: Controlled Outsourcing Model

#### **1. Define and Freeze the Scope**

- No "custom sites". Sell only **modular, fixed-format products**.
- E.g., "5-page company site", "basic SEO landing page", "basic e-commerce template".
- No exceptions. Each deviation cuts margin and increases coordination overhead.

#### **2. Source Talent Outside the Globalized Marketplaces**

- Avoid Upwork unless for stopgap work.
- Use regional Facebook groups, university job boards, Discord servers, or local tech communities in lower-income countries.
- Focus: Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Serbia, Georgia), Latin America (Colombia, Peru), Southeast Asia (Philippines, Vietnam).
- You're not hiring "developers" in general--you're assembling **production-line workers** for a **controlled task**.

#### **3. Build a Private Bench**

- Hire 2--3 junior devs/designers on monthly part-time retainers (€300--700 range).
- Pay for availability and outcome, not hours.
- Offer predictability (monthly pay, consistent scope), not project variability.
- Over time, build trust, efficiency, and margin.

#### **4. Systematise Delivery Process**

- Provide Figma templates, component libraries, code snippets.
- Use tools like Notion or ClickUp for step-by-step workflows.
- Create reusable assets: layouts, nav bars, footers, form blocks.

This turns unremarkable labor into predictable output.

#### **5. Create a Buffer Layer**

- Insert a mid-level QA/project assistant (could be local or remote).
- They handle client comms, revisions, and contractor management.
- You remove yourself from execution before scale forces you to.

### Price Anchoring for Your Business Model

**Target sale price (for SME site):** €2,000--5,000  
**Target internal delivery cost:** €500--1,200  
**Net (after tools, payment processors, admin):** ~€1,500--3,000 per project  
**At 4--5 projects/month:** €6k--15k revenue, scalable with minimal headcount
* * *

### Avoid These Common Mistakes

- Don't try to find "cheap React developers"--irrelevant if your product scope is wrong.
- Don't negotiate projects individually--standardise or die.
- Don't rely on marketplace profiles--test with pilot tasks before onboarding.
- Don't assume you need "the best" developers--only **reliable executors** of known patterns.
* * *

### Final Directive

**You don't outsource development.** You **delegate standardised tasks** within a pre-designed system. Skip the open market. Source undervalued labor where trust and repeatability are still buildable. Use simple tools, prebuilt assets, and enforce scope discipline. Your edge is not price--it's **clarity, control, and operational leverage**.
