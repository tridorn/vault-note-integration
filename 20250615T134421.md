You should have asked: _"Given the systemic shortcomings of my current cadence-structure model--fuzzy role definitions, absent project layer, non-binding interfaces--design a fully integrated, logically clean organizational schema that unites cadence, execution, coordination, and strategy into a modular but scalable operating framework."_

* * *

## REBUILT STRUCTURE: **Echelon Framework v1.0**

A unified operating system that binds **Time (Cadence)**, **Action (Execution Units)**, **Scope (Projects/Initiatives)**, and **Command (Strategic Governance)**. All components are **orthogonal but interoperable**.

* * *

### I. TIME AXIS: **Cadence Tiers**

| Tier | Time Span | Function | Actor Role | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Pulse** | 1 day | Situational awareness, reflection | Individual · Squad | 
| **Sprint** | 1--2 weeks | Tactical output focus | Squad · Mission | 
| **Mission** | 1--3 months | Execution arc with clear success criteria | Mission Team | 
| **Campaign** | 6--12 months | Strategic goal arc | Task Force | 
| **Season** | 1 year | Portfolio and resource rebalancing | Strategic Command | 

**Note**: _Tour_ is discarded. Redundant with Mission and Campaign when cadence is handled via planning layers.

* * *

### II. EXECUTION AXIS: **Operational Units**

| Unit Type | Purpose | Characteristics | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Squad** | Individual contributors and pairs | Core working cell; may shift between missions | 
| **Mission** | Tactical unit focused on an output | Sprint-bound, autonomous, tied to a project | 
| **Task Force** | Cross-functional strategic unit | Composed of multiple missions | 
| **Strike Group** | Short-term, high-impact ad hoc team | Used to resolve blockers or capitalize openings | 

**Interface Rule**: Every Mission operates under a **Project**; every Task Force spans one or more Projects.

* * *

### III. SCOPE AXIS: **Projects & Programs**

| Element | Function | Owner | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Project** | Bounded goal with resourcing, timeline | Product Owner · Project Lead | 
| **Program** | Aggregation of related projects | Program Manager | 
- **Project = Contracted intent**
- **Mission = Execution method**

Projects _own_ success; Missions _execute_ the pathway.

* * *

### IV. COMMAND AXIS: **Governance Stack**

| Layer | Responsibility | Governs | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Mission Command** | Operational coherence across Missions | Standards · Output QA | 
| **Program Council** | Project/program alignment with strategic direction | Resource arbitration | 
| **Strategic Command** | Direction-setting for the whole organization | Campaigns · Season | 

**Command owns the cadence. Execution owns the method. Scope owns the outcome.**

* * *

### V. MAPPING LOGIC

1. **Every Mission** must declare:

    - The **Project** it serves

    - The **Sprint schedule** it operates on

    - The **Output** it commits to

2. **Every Project** must:

    - Map to a **Program** or stand alone

    - Be composed of one or more **Missions**

    - Be associated with a **Campaign** when strategic

3. **Task Forces** are optional scaffolds used to align cross-project execution under a Campaign.

4. **Campaigns** are **time-boxed strategic arcs**, not execution units. They are reviewed Seasonally.
* * *

### VI. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE (for implementation)
    
    
    /[Project-Name]
    │
    ├── 00_Project_Charter/
    │   └─ scope.md, owner.md, budget.xlsx
    │
    ├── 01_Missions/
    │   ├─ M-01_Kickoff/
    │   ├─ M-02_Prototype/
    │   └─ ...
    │
    ├── 02_Execution/
    │   ├─ Sprints/
    │   ├─ Deliverables/
    │   └─ Logs/
    │
    ├── 03_Reviews/
    │   ├─ Retro/
    │   └─ Milestones/
    │
    └── 90_Archive/
    

This is enforced via `project-init` scripts; versioning and metadata handled via `README.md` and `_meta.yaml` in each folder.

## FINAL NOTE

This model enables:

- **Scalable clarity**: Clean distinction between time, execution, scope, and governance.
- **Interoperability**: Projects span missions; missions deliver into sprints; campaigns structure cross-project focus.
- **Governance traceability**: Strategic command is structurally embedded without micromanagement.

You've built the bones of a sovereign operating model. This structure gives it muscle and nerves.
