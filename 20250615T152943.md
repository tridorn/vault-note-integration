**Clarification of your ask:** _"Explain the 'Cell' (and optional 'Squad') concept--composition, mandate, life-cycle, and its distinct value relative to Missions and higher layers."_
* * *

## 1 Definition Spectrum

| Term | Ontological Category | Concise Definition | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Cell** | _Capability Unit_ | The smallest cross-functional team with all skills required to close a Sprint backlog slice autonomously. | 
| **Squad** | _Specialist Sub-Unit_ (optional) | A mono-discipline micro-team nested within a Cell when one competency (e.g., UI, firmware, legal drafting) demands parallel depth that would bloat Cell size. | 
* * *

## 2 Constituents

| Role | Function | FTE Norm | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Cell Lead** | Holds Sprint goal, ensures integration of work, carries the Single Point of Accountability. | 1 | 
| **Core Makers** | Engineers, designers, analysts--whatever craft the backlog demands. | 2-4 | 
| **Embedded SME** (as needed) | Regulatory, data science, localisation--rotates in; not counted in headcount cap. | 0-1 | 

> **Cardinal Rule:** no Cell exceeds **five** stable members. Beyond that, velocity drops due to communication drag.
* * *

## 3 Mandate and Operating Envelope

1. **Backlog Ownership** -- The Cell, not the Mission, pulls Sprint stories; the Mission merely enforces the Definition of Done.

2. **Method Sovereignty** -- Tooling, coding conventions, estimation model are Cell prerogatives.

3. **Cadence Integrity** -- Daily Pulse stand-up and Sprint ceremonies are non-negotiable; the Field Officer audits compliance.

4. **Output Contract** -- Deliverables must satisfy the Mission's acceptance criteria and integrate without downstream rework.
* * *

## 4 Lifecycle & Persistence

| Phase | Cell Status | Rationale | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Mission Formation** | Cells are assigned or formed from the talent bench. | Rapid spin-up; leverage existing cohesion where possible. | 
| **Execution** | Cells remain stable for the Mission's full 3-6 Sprint arc. | Minimise thrash; maximise flow efficiency. | 
| **Post-Mission** | Three paths: redeploy intact, refactor membership, or dissolve. | Avoid idle payroll, preserve tacit knowledge where valuable. | 

A Cell _may_ outlive a Mission if its capability has durable demand (e.g., platform security). Otherwise, Cells de-materialise and talent returns to a shared bench.

## 5 Interaction Inside a Mission
    
    
    Mission Commander   ←→   Cell Leads
            ↑                       ↑
    Field Officer (facilitation)    |
            ↑                       |
     Support Divisions  ←───────────┘
    

- Mission Commander sets Sprint-level acceptance criteria, tracks aggregate burn-down.
- Each Cell Lead negotiates backlog scope and reports Sprint status.
- Field Officer removes blockers (e.g., procurement delays) and enforces cadence ritual hygiene.

## 6 Value Proposition vs. Mission

| Attribute | Cell | Mission | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Unit of 'Who + How'** | Yes | Partially (via Commander) | 
| **Unit of 'What + When'** | Indirectly (Sprint goals) | Directly (Mission Order) | 
| **Scope Complexity** | Micro | Macro | 
| **Budget Authority** | None | Limited (within Project ceiling) | 
| **Cross-Functional Cohesion** | High | Orchestrates, not executes | 

**Strategic Rationale:**

- _Missions_ answer **purpose** ("achieve X by date Y").
- _Cells_ answer **mechanism** ("with these skills, in this Sprint, at this quality").

Separating the two lets Mission Commanders reshuffle objectives without disbanding proven performer units, and lets Cells perfect craft without the sprawl of Mission-level governance.

## 7 Trade-Off Matrix

| Benefit | Cost | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Velocity through micro-scale coordination | Added structural layer to staff and monitor | 
| Reusable team chemistry across Missions | Risk of Cell tribalism resisting refactor | 
| Clear SPA at execution granularity | Small teams may lack redundancy for leave/attrition | 
| Easy performance telemetry (Sprint metrics) | Requires robust talent bench to re-assemble on demand |

### Summary

A **Cell** is the execution nucleus: lean, cross-functional, Sprint-anchored, and method-sovereign. It furnishes the speed and clarity that a larger Mission cannot deliver alone. Squads refine this nucleus when domain depth threatens to overload the five-person cap. By bifurcating _objective containers_ (Missions) from _capability containers_ (Cells), you decouple strategic intent from the mechanics of delivery--maximising agility while maintaining an intelligible command lattice.
