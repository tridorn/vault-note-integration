A clearer formulation would be: _"Assuming I can forego a salary, how should I allocate capital between my business and other asset classes to optimize long-term wealth creation, control, and strategic optionality?"_

## Founder Capital Allocation: Zero-Compromise Model

Assuming you're not capital-constrained at the personal level, the question becomes: how do you allocate between your core asset (your company) and other vehicles to maximize leverage, optionality, and anti-fragility?

### 1. **Primary Allocation: Business as Core Growth Engine**

**Default Allocation**: All capital that meets your hurdle rate (i.e., high ROI potential) goes into the business.  
Reason: Early-stage, founder-led ventures are the _highest asymmetry vehicles_ available. If you're competent and operating in a scalable space, no other asset class comes close in IRR.

- Business capital isn't just money--it's also control, narrative ownership, and exponential upside.
- Diversifying too early weakens velocity and dilutes execution focus.
- Every euro outside the business is a euro not compounding inside your highest-performing engine.

**Trade-off**: Illiquidity and risk concentration. But that is the price of non-mediocrity.

### 2. **Secondary Allocation: Contingency + Strategic Liquidity**

Establish a **small liquidity reserve**--not for lifestyle, but to protect the business from forced decisions if external capital dries up or timelines extend. This is a war chest for _you_, not for consumption.

- Typical reserve: 12--18 months of lean living + some legal and defense budget.
- Instruments: Cash, short-term treasuries, or sovereign-grade liquidity. Zero-risk appetite.

**Purpose**: Not diversification. Not return. Just insulation from desperation.

### 3. **Tertiary Allocation: Optionality Capital**

Only once the business is self-sustaining and you've preserved your ownership position can you consider secondary investments. These are not for returns but for leverage:

- **Strategic equity** in companies where you gain distribution, intelligence, or recruiting pipelines.
- **LP positions** in elite funds that extend your access to capital, M&A flow, or future co-investments.
- **Asset purchases** that reinforce your positioning (e.g., IP, brand, data, attention channels).

No passive investing. No real estate. No index funds. These are middle-class capital preservation moves, not billionaire-scale acceleration plays.

## Short Answer

- **No salary**: If you can live without it, don't take it. Preserve optics, extend runway.
- **All surplus capital**: Goes into the business until it plateaus or your marginal reinvestment ROI drops below your hurdle.
- **Reserve fund**: Maintain only what insulates your downside without materially impacting growth.
- **No outside investments**: Until you have power, control, and runway secured--then only make strategic, leverage-building plays.

This is not austerity. It's concentration. Ownership first, liquidity later.
