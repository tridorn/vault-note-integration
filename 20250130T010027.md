# Cornell Note-Taking in IPO

"Can I also use techniques like Cornell note-taking? Where would it attach—before the Obsidian input-process-output structure?"

Yes, integrating **Cornell note-taking** into your system is a powerful way to enhance the *Input* phase. Cornell's structure naturally complements the **Input → Process → Output** model by acting as a scaffold for initial note-taking, especially in situations like lectures or reading. This method can serve as an *active capturing mechanism* before moving into deeper synthesis in the process-output stages.

Here’s how to integrate it effectively:

### 1. **Cornell Note-Taking as Pre-Input: Capturing and Organizing**

The Cornell method consists of three parts:

- **Notes (Right column)**: This is where you record key facts, concepts, or ideas during lectures, readings, or while listening to podcasts.
- **Cues/Keywords (Left column)**: After the session, you summarize each section by writing key terms, questions, or prompts.
- **Summary (Bottom section)**: At the end of the note, you write a brief summary of the entire page's contents.

#### Where This Fits

- **Before the Input Phase**: Cornell note-taking provides a structured way of capturing raw information during the session. You will then move to the **Input** phase, where you can take your Cornell notes and condense them into the distilled, summarized content in Obsidian.

#### Steps

- **Take Cornell Notes During Engagement**: Whether reading, listening to a lecture, or discussing, the Cornell method gives you a clear space for jotting down key points and organizing thoughts.
- **Post-Session (Input Phase)**: Transfer the **notes and cues** into the **Input** layer of your Obsidian note, using the condensed structure from your Cornell notes as the summary of key ideas.
- **Process Phase**: Use the cues/questions from the Cornell format to guide your reflection and critical thinking in the **Process** layer.

### 2. **How It Works in Practice**

#### A. **During Engagement: Cornell Method**

Let’s say you’re in a lecture about decision-making frameworks. Using the Cornell format:

- **Right Column (Notes)**: You capture the professor's key points:
  - “Decisions based on rational choice theory assume humans act logically.”
  - “Behavioral economics shows we act irrationally due to biases.”
- **Left Column (Cues)**: Afterward, you add keywords and questions:
  - "Rational choice theory, cognitive biases"
  - “Why do biases affect decision-making in real-life scenarios?”
- **Bottom Section (Summary)**: Write a brief overview of the topic:
  - “Theories of decision-making reveal a tension between ideal rationality and actual human behavior, highlighting the role of cognitive biases.”

#### B. **Post-Engagement: Moving to Obsidian**

After the lecture or reading session, you transfer the distilled information into Obsidian:

- **Input Layer**:

  ```
  # Summary:
  - Rational choice theory suggests people make decisions logically, but behavioral economics shows they often don't due to biases like loss aversion and framing effects.
  ```

  - The **Input** phase now acts as a direct, condensed version of your Cornell notes.

- **Processing Layer**:  
  Use the questions and cues from your Cornell notes to guide deeper reflection:

  ```
  # Analysis:
  - Why are biases so pervasive in decision-making, even in high-stakes situations?
  - How can I design frameworks to minimize these biases in team decisions?
  ```

- **Output Layer**:  
  Take action from what you’ve learned and processed:

  ```
  # Application:
  - I will incorporate bias recognition exercises in our AMU strategy meetings to improve decision-making.
  ```

### 3. **Combining Cornell and the Input → Process → Output Model**

You can think of the Cornell method as the **raw organizational scaffold**—the first contact with the material, before you dive into deeper work. The Input → Process → Output model then serves as your **engagement and transformation phase**.

#### Flow of Information

1. **Cornell Notes (Pre-Input)**:
	- Capture key points during engagement.
	- Use cues and keywords to summarize and highlight questions.
2. **Obsidian Input**:
	- Transfer distilled insights from Cornell notes.
	- Synthesize the core ideas in a condensed manner, abstracting away unnecessary details.
3. **Obsidian Process**:
	- Use the keywords/questions from Cornell’s cues section to generate deeper analysis.
4. **Obsidian Output**:
	- Apply insights, generate actionable steps, or reformulate your understanding.

#### Example Flow

- **Cornell Notes on a Lecture**:
  - **Notes**: Capture ideas like "Kahneman's System 1 and System 2 thinking."
  - **Cues**: Write questions like "How can System 2 be trained?" and key terms like "heuristics."
  - **Summary**: “System 1 is fast, intuitive thinking; System 2 is slower, more deliberate but requires effort.”

- **Input in Obsidian**:

  ```
  - System 1: Fast, automatic thinking based on heuristics.
  - System 2: Slow, deliberate thinking, but it requires effort and energy.
  ```

- **Process in Obsidian**:

  ```
  - How can I incorporate System 2 thinking into decision-making frameworks to reduce biases?
  - What techniques can encourage deliberate thinking in time-constrained situations?
  ```

- **Output in Obsidian**:

  ```
  - I will design meetings with pre-decision reflection time to ensure System 2 thinking is activated before final decisions.
  ```

### 4. **Why Integrate Cornell?**

Cornell’s format provides **real-time structure** while engaging with material. It helps you stay organized during the initial capture phase, while the **Input → Process → Output** model ensures you digest and apply that knowledge more deeply afterward.

#### Benefits of This Integration

- **Immediate Organization**: Cornell method organizes notes instantly, so there’s minimal effort when transitioning to synthesis in Obsidian.
- **Engagement Depth**: The cues/questions from Cornell act as perfect prompts for the **Processing** phase in Obsidian, pushing you to reflect more critically.
- **Efficiency**: You already start from a well-structured note with Cornell, so transitioning to Obsidian is smooth and doesn’t require restructuring.

### Conclusion: Cornell as a Pre-Input Phase

Cornell note-taking can serve as a **pre-Input phase** that captures and organizes raw information during a lecture or reading session. It helps you maintain clarity and focus, setting the stage for deeper engagement through the **Input → Process → Output** system in Obsidian. This layered approach ensures that your notes evolve from initial capture to deeper personal synthesis and practical application.
