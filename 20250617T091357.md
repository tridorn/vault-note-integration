Your prompt should have read: _"Define a coherent domain- and e-mail-naming scheme that preserves sovereignty, scales with multiple ventures, and minimises legal and reputational exposure."_
* * *

## 1 -- First Principles

1. **One root identity domain** -- the corporate signature never changes.

2. **Brand domains are disposable** -- product or campaign URLs can be retired without touching core e-mail infrastructure.

3. **Legal separation before marketing convenience** -- avoid mixing regulated (finance) and unregulated traffic under one FQDN.

4. **Minimal surface for fishing** -- the fewer variations users must recognise, the smaller the attack window.
* * *

## 2 -- Domain Taxonomy

| Layer | Purpose | Naming Rule | Example | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Root-Identity** | Corporate e-mail, SSO, invoices | Short .com / .eu; no hyphens | `eupator.com` | 
| **Public-Corporate** | Brochure site, press | Vanity subdomain on root | `house.eupator.com` | 
| **Venture** | Long-lived sub-brands (Veridian) | Separate second-level domain | `veridian.finance` | 
| **Campaign / Landing** | Short-term marketing, A/B, SEO | Subdomain under venture OR new SLD; max one level deep | `green.veridian.finance` | 
| **Infrastructure** | Git, CI, object store | Private subdomains; not externally resolvable | `git.eupator.com`, `ci.eupator.com` | 

Rule of thumb: exactly **one** second-level domain per capital-bearing venture; everything else is subdomain.
* * *

## 3 -- E-Mail Scheme

| Role | Address Pattern | Rationale | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Staff | `<first>.<last>@eupator.com` | Single identity across all ventures; avoids mailbox sprawl | 
| System | `no-reply@<service>.<root>` (e.g. `no-reply@git.eupator.com`) | DKIM/SPF confined to function subdomain | 
| Venture Support | `support@<venture>.finance` | Customer-facing e-mail segregated from corporate | 

Key-man addresses (`founder@`, `ceo@`) forward to personal inboxes, but never appear in DNS records to reduce spear-phishing surface.

* * *

## 4 -- Portfolio Strategy

1. **Defensive registration** -- buy the .com, .net, .org and relevant ccTLDs for root identity; only .com (or thematic TLD) for ventures.

2. **Wildcards only internally** -- avoid `*.domain.com` externally; it weakens certificate pinning.

3. **Hard-expire campaign domains** -- set registrar auto-delete 90 days after campaign closure; forces cleanup.
* * *

## 5 -- Governance & Process

1. **One registrar account** per legal entity; registrar access via hardware-key MFA.

2. **Quarterly domain audit** to cull zombie campaign domains.

3. **E-mail alias lifecycle** -- aliases expire with the Mission that spawned them; FO is custodian.

4. **DNS change log** -- every modification is a Git-tracked YAML file (`infra/dns/changeset-YYMMDD.yaml`). CI compares YAML to registrar API, preventing shadow edits.
* * *

## 6 -- Decision Guide

**When to spin a new second-level domain?**

- The venture holds autonomous P&L.
- The venture seeks external funding.
- Regulatory scope (e.g. green finance) mandates segregated branding.

**When not to?**

- Purely internal tooling.
- Short-life content (campaigns, A/B tests).
- Sub-brand still in validation.

### Bottom Line

_One_ inviolable corporate domain â†’ staff, auth, invoices.  
_One_ second-level per real venture.  
All else lives as subdomains or disposable campaign domains, time-boxed, auto-expiring.  
This preserves strategic clarity, supports due-diligence hygiene, and limits attack surface without throttling marketing freedom.
