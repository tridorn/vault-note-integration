Here’s a **roadmap** tailored to you as a first-semester student in business administration, with a focus on **investment banking**. This roadmap is designed to help you build the necessary skills, experiences, and network, while also giving attention to your interests in **marketing** and the **Chinese market**.

### **Phase 1: Establish the Foundation (First 6 Months)**

1. **Understand the Basics of Investment Banking**  
	- **Courses**: Start with the core finance and business courses in your curriculum, paying extra attention to **financial accounting**, **corporate finance**, and **economics**. 
	- **Self-Study**: Begin reading essential finance books like *"Investment Banking: Valuation, Leveraged Buyouts, and Mergers & Acquisitions"* by Joshua Rosenbaum, which will give you a head start in understanding industry basics.

2. **Develop Excel Skills**  
	- **Online Courses**: Take a **beginner-to-advanced Excel course** for finance (Udemy, Coursera). Investment banking revolves around financial modeling in Excel, so mastering Excel is non-negotiable.
	- **Daily Practice**: Start practicing basic **financial modeling** in Excel. Use resources like *Wall Street Prep* or *Breaking Into Wall Street* for hands-on practice.

3. **Join Finance/Investment Banking Societies (AKB)**  
	- **Actionable Step**: As a member of **AKB Invest** or other finance-related societies at your university, actively participate in workshops, stock pitch competitions, and networking events. This will expose you to practical knowledge and build a network within the field.
	- **Commit to M&A or Investment**: Show up regularly to meetings, engage in group discussions, and build relationships with mentors and peers.

4. **Focus on Mandarin Language Skills (If Applicable)**  
	- **Language Courses**: Continue learning **Mandarin** if you haven’t already. Enroll in university language programs or apps like **Duolingo** to strengthen your conversational skills.
	- **HSK Certification**: Start preparing for **HSK Level 3** to build your language credibility, particularly if you're aiming for a focus on **cross-border deals** involving China.

### **Phase 2: Build Technical Skills & Certifications (6–12 Months)**

1. **Obtain Key Certifications**
	- **Bloomberg Market Concepts (BMC)**: Complete this certification within 6 months. It will provide you with a solid understanding of **financial markets** and familiarity with Bloomberg terminals.
	- **Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst (FMVA®)**: Start the FMVA course online through **Corporate Finance Institute (CFI)**. This will give you a deeper understanding of **valuation**, **M&A**, and **financial modeling**—key skills for investment banking.

2. **Begin Networking**
	- **LinkedIn & University Events**: Update your **LinkedIn** profile with your interests and activities (e.g., day trading, AKB Invest projects). Attend **networking events** organized by university societies or external platforms like CFA Institute.
	- **Coffee Chats**: Reach out to senior students or alumni who have pursued investment banking internships. Schedule informational interviews to learn about their experiences and get tips on applications.

3. **Work on Financial Projects**
	- **Personal Projects**: Start an **investment blog** where you write about market trends, stock picks, or index futures trades. Share these on LinkedIn to demonstrate your practical understanding of financial markets.
	- **Case Studies/Competitions**: Participate in **stock pitch competitions** or **financial case studies** to demonstrate your ability to analyze companies and build valuation models.

4. **Internship Search Prep**
	- **Build Your CV**: Continue refining your CV by adding any certifications, competitions, or projects you’ve completed. Ensure it highlights your Excel, financial modeling, and market analysis skills.
	- **Begin Searching for Summer Internships**: Although you are in your first year, some **boutique investment firms** or finance departments may offer early internships or insight programs. Look into applying for **spring weeks** (introductory programs at banks like JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs) for hands-on exposure.

### **Phase 3: Gain Practical Experience (12–18 Months)**

1. **Apply for Internships**  
	- **Spring/Summer Internships**: Apply to spring or summer **internship programs** at smaller financial firms, boutiques, or corporate finance departments. These internships provide real-world experience and make your CV stand out for bigger investment banking roles later.
	- **Networking Follow-Up**: Stay in touch with contacts you’ve made, including those you’ve met through AKB or any informational interviews. Personal referrals can significantly improve your chances.

2. **Deepen Technical Skills with Python & SQL**  
	- **Learn Python for Finance**: Take a course like *Python for Finance* (Coursera or Udemy) to enhance your ability to analyze financial data and create investment models. 
	- **SQL for Financial Data**: SQL is crucial for managing large datasets in finance. Completing an **SQL for Data Science** course will help you gain credibility in analyzing market and financial data efficiently.

3. **Case Study & M&A Simulations**  
	- **M&A Projects**: If AKB offers M&A deal simulations or case competitions, make sure to participate. These projects will give you hands-on experience in structuring deals, valuing companies, and modeling transactions.
	- **Case Study Competitions**: Aim to participate in **international case study competitions**. Some universities or organizations like **CFA Institute** host challenges that mimic real-world investment decisions.

4. **Take More Specialized Certifications**  
	- **CFA Level I**: If possible, register for CFA Level I exams during your second year to build a foundation in financial analysis, portfolio management, and ethics. Completing even just the first level of the CFA program will give your CV a major boost.
	- **FRM (Optional)**: If risk management also piques your interest, consider preparing for **Financial Risk Manager (FRM)** exams. This can be valuable if you want to work in risk-heavy sectors like **structured finance**.

### **Phase 4: Master the Process and Prepare for IB Roles (18–24 Months)**

1. **Secure a High-Profile Internship**  
	- By now, you should have built a network and relevant experience. Leverage your experience, certifications, and networking to land an **internship at a top-tier investment bank** (e.g., **Goldman Sachs**, **Morgan Stanley**, **JP Morgan**).
	- Prepare thoroughly for **technical interviews** with practice on **DCF, LBO, and comparable company models**. You can use **Wall Street Prep** and **Breaking Into Wall Street** resources for this.

2. **Master Behavioral & Technical Interviews**  
	- **Mock Interviews**: Start doing mock interviews with peers or using platforms like **Big Interview**. You’ll need to ace both the behavioral "fit" questions and the highly technical financial modeling questions.
	- **Technical Practice**: Regularly review and practice valuation methods, financial models, and market trends to stay sharp.

3. **Build Global Market Knowledge (China Focus)**  
	- Continue improving your **Mandarin** and learning about Chinese markets, trade policies, and regulations. You could take a **Chinese Business Certificate** or attend China-specific finance seminars.
	- Follow financial developments in **APAC**, particularly China, and write about these in your blog or portfolio to demonstrate knowledge in cross-border finance.

4. **Final Push for Internships/Full-Time Offers**  
	- If you haven’t already, start applying for **summer analyst positions** at large investment banks. Make sure your CV, certifications, and interview prep are polished.
	- Leverage your network (especially through AKB alumni and mentors) to gain referrals or recommendations for investment banking roles.
