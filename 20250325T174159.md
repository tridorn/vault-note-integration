Certainly. First, your request could have been phrased as:

> “Please generate a complete fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram to identify root causes preventing SMEs from successfully accessing green loans, based on the problem we're solving.”

Now, here is a **full fishbone diagram structure**, designed for your **GreenSME platform**—mapping out the **core problem**:  
> **“SMEs are not accessing green loans at the scale needed.”**

## **Fishbone Diagram for Green Loan Accessibility Problem**

### **Main Problem (Head of the Fish):**
> **Low Uptake of Green Loans by SMEs in Eastern Europe**

---

### **1. People (SMEs, Bank Staff, Consultants)**
- SME owners lack awareness of what constitutes a “green project”
- SMEs don’t have internal staff dedicated to sustainability or finance
- Loan officers lack technical knowledge on energy/climate projects
- SMEs and banks both rely on consultants for assessments—slow, expensive
- Mistrust or communication gaps between SMEs and banks

---

### **2. Process (Loan Application & Evaluation)**
- Application process is overly bureaucratic and fragmented
- Energy audits or impact analyses are required but difficult to obtain
- No standardized forms or assessment criteria across banks
- SMEs don’t know how to present the right documents/data
- Turnaround time for approvals is too long for small projects

---

### **3. Technology (Tools & Infrastructure)**
- No integrated digital tools for SMEs to prepare green project proposals
- Eligibility calculators (e.g. EEQuest) are not embedded in daily workflows
- Poor use of open banking, utility APIs, or IoT for performance data
- Banks lack automated systems for classifying green loans
- Most green financing programs rely on outdated portals or paper-based flows

---

### **4. Information (Awareness, Literacy, Transparency)**
- SMEs don’t know what qualifies as green or where to start
- No centralized database of technologies, subsidies, or incentives
- Lack of simple ROI calculators for SMEs to assess project viability
- Banks don’t proactively educate clients on green loan opportunities
- ESG/green reporting feels abstract and irrelevant to small business owners

---

### **5. Environment (Policy, Market, Ecosystem)**
- High upfront costs for green technologies (solar, insulation, etc.)
- Green subsidies or incentives are complex, fragmented, or localized
- Uncertainty about future carbon regulation disincentivizes investment
- Climate literacy is low in many SME ecosystems
- Public awareness campaigns often miss the SME audience

---

### **6. Measurement (Verification, Impact, Risk)**
- Banks struggle to verify energy savings or carbon reductions post-loan
- No standardized metrics for SMEs to report project outcomes
- Risk models don’t incorporate green project ROI or impact data
- Uncertainty around taxonomy alignment (e.g. EU Green Taxonomy) discourages banks
- Limited tools to track ongoing performance of green assets

---

## **Visual Layout Guidance**

If you're drawing this out:
- Draw a **horizontal arrow** (the spine), pointing right to the main problem.
- Branch off **six diagonal arrows** labeled with each of the six categories above.
- Add the **causal items as short sub-branches** along each diagonal line.

If you'd like a **ready-made fishbone diagram image or template** in PowerPoint, Figma, or another tool, I can produce it or format it to your needs. Would you like that next?
