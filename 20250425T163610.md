*Correction → A more perspicuous formulation would have been:*  
> “Sketch a recurring **Dispatch**—an internal (or partly external) periodical—for an ACM-organised enterprise: articulate its raison d’être, canonical sections, editorial workflow, and the manifold organisational dividends it confers.”

---

### **I / Teleological Rationale**

The **Dispatch** functions as a **knowledge-spline** binding the lattice of transient AMUs, doctrinal Staff, and the Officer Corps.  
Its remit is fourfold:

1. **Strategic Coherence** – crystallise Leadership-Council intent into digestible signals.  
2. **Doctrinal Osmosis** – propagate AGS refinements, AAR insights, and micro-doctrine updates.  
3. **Meritocratic Spotlight** – lionise high-performers, promote upward mobility, and embed up-or-out expectations.  
4. **Venture Pheromone** – advertise nascent Mission blueprints and innovation tenders to attract talent.

### **II / Canonical Rubric (Section Taxonomy)**

| § | Column Title | Curator | Scope & Typical Content |
|---|--------------|---------|-------------------------|
| Ⅰ | **“Orbital Brief”** | Council Chair (O-6) | Macroeconomic tremors, strategic pivots, capital deployments. |
| Ⅱ | **“Staff Orders & Doctrine Notices”** | AGS Chief (O-4) | New SOPs, deprecated rituals, scenario playbook updates, risk advisories. |
| Ⅲ | **“Field Dispatches”** | Senior LFO cadre (O-2) | 3–5 vignettes from active AMUs—KRs hit, blockers vanquished, emergent heuristics. |
| Ⅳ | **“Innovation Bulb”** | Innovation-Hub Editor (O-1/O-2) | MVP launches, experiment metrics, invite for volunteers to next spin. |
| Ⅴ | **“Ledger & Quiver”** | OCD-Finance & People officers | Financial run-rate flashes, talent inflows/outflows, promotion board results. |
| Ⅵ | **“Laurels & Lessons”** | Doctrine Cell | Concise AAR synopses, failure post-mortems, commendations, demotions. |
| Ⅶ | **“Signals & Portents”** | ICC Analysts | Market intel heat-map, competitor manoeuvres, regulatory alerts. |
| Ⅷ | **“Op-Ed / Polemic”** | Rotating Officer (O-1+) | Thought-piece challenging orthodoxy; peer-reviewed by Staff. |

---

### **III / Periodicities & Editions**

| Cadence | Edition Moniker | Use-Case |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| **Weekly** | *Field Bulletin* | Fast tactical rhythm for AMU-level execution. |
| **Monthly** | *Staff Gazette* | Consolidated metrics, doctrine deltas, Officer promotion list. |
| **Quarterly** | *Strategic Review* | Deep retrospection, risk-heat, capital re-allocation manifesto. |
| **Ad-Hoc (Crisis)** | *Red Sheet* | Zero-day exploit, geopolitical shock, liquidity crunch. |

### **IV / Editorial Organogram**

```

│  Council   │  veto-right on Strategic Review only
└────┬───────┘
     ▼
┌───────────────┐
│  Editor-in-Chief (O-3)│  ← permanent billet in AGS Doctrine Cell
└────┬──────────┘
     ▼
┌───────────────────────────┐
│  Dispatch Bureau (Mini-AMU)│  – 4-6 rotating officers
└────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬────┘
     ▼     ▼     ▼     ▼
 Field   Doctrine Finance ICC etc.
 Stringers
```

*Rotation cadence:* every 2 × sprints (≈4 weeks) a new officer joins; institutional memory resides in the Notion “Dispatch Pipeline” DB and style-guide.

---

### **V / Notion Implementation Sketch**

1. **Database:** `Dispatch Articles`  
   - Props → Section, Status (Pitch ▸ Draft ▸ Fact-Check ▸ Scheduled ▸ Published), Author, EditionLink (relation).  
2. **Database:** `Dispatch Editions`  
   - Date, Cadence, PDF Export, Read-Rate KPI (roll-up).  
3. **Template:** “Article Draft” with inline comment thread, asset embeds.  
4. **Automation:**  
   - On `Status = Published` → Zapier post to Slack `#dispatch` + email digest.  
   - Read-Rate < 60 % triggers LFO outreach to delinquent nodes.

---

### **VI / Cultural & Meritocratic Effects**

*Positive selection:*  
- Officers whose prose and insight galvanise action accrue **Doctrine-Contribution score** → accelerates promotion gate.  
- AMUs featured in “Laurels & Lessons” gain prestige; repeated negative “Portents” flags trigger command review.

*Knowledge retention:*  
- Dispatch PDF + linked artifacts become immutable archive; AGS scrapes lessons into doctrine DB.

*Alignment engine:*  
- Weekly Field Bulletin ensures tactical synchronicity.  
- Monthly Gazette binds middle layers (Task-Forces, OCDs) with hard data.  
- Quarterly Review furnishes shareholders with a narrative of strategic stewardship.

---

### **VII / Minimal Viable Launch (Solo Founder Scenario)**

1. Create **Notion template** “Dispatch 00” with the § taxonomy.  
2. Publish bi-weekly Google-Doc-to-PDF → manually drop in Notion “Editions.”  
3. Once > 3 AMUs exist, charter a **2-person Dispatch Bureau Flash-AMU** to institutionalise the flow.  
4. KPIs: open-rate, actionable item count, promotion nominations originating from Dispatch.

---

**Thus the Dispatch becomes the organisation’s *chronicle, compass, and crucible*: a rhythmic instrument that imprints strategy, curates learning, incites experimentation, and spotlights merit—exactly the informational hydrostatic that an ACM-driven ‘company of commanders’ demands.**
