Good. Let’s ground this.

You're offering **a tightly scoped diagnostic service** that reveals where a business is losing time, money, or sanity in operations—and shows what can be done about it.
You do not consult. You **map**, **structure**, **quantify**, and **propose**. That’s the entire job.

---

## I. What You’re Actually Doing

### 1. **You extract their current workflows**

* Via structured intake call: “Walk me through how X is currently done.”
* You cover areas like:

  * Repetitive admin (quotes, invoices, email handling)
  * Employee onboarding
  * Customer interactions
  * Internal file chaos
  * Manual documentation
  * Compliance checklists
  * Data reporting

You do not need to know their industry. You need to ask:
**"Who does what, with what tools, in what order, and where does it break?"**

You record this (Otter.ai), segment the flow, and convert it into a **process map** or bullet sequence.

---

### 2. **You structure their chaos**

* You translate the unstructured conversation into:

  * **Clear workflows** (steps, roles, tools)
  * **Pain points** (delays, errors, waste)
  * **Failure costs** (€ per delay, man-hours lost, compliance risk)

AI helps here:

* GPT-4o reformats their spoken input
* Claude helps produce text-based SOPs, summaries
* You make diagrams, summaries, or process visuals from their messy operations

---

### 3. **You show what could be better**

You use a library of known solutions—simple automations, Notion systems, dashboards, email logic, template-driven output—and say:

> “This is where you’re losing 12 hours/week and risking €3 000/month in mistakes.
> If we implemented \[A], \[B], \[C], this would be eliminated.”

You illustrate:

* What it would look like (Notion screenshot, tool example, AI sketch)
* Time/cost saved
* Price if you were to implement it

That’s it.

---

## II. What the Client Sees (Deliverables)

1. **One PDF file (10–20 slides/pages)**
   Contains:

   * Process summaries
   * Visuals or diagrams (simple, not corporate)
   * Commentary: where time is lost, where stress accumulates
   * Suggestions for change (not implementation yet)

2. **Optional Notion preview**
   E.g., digital SOP space, employee onboarding checklist, client intake workflow

3. **Loom walkthrough (5 min)**
   You explain what you found, what it means, and what the next step could be.

---

## III. Why This is Valuable to Them

You give a business owner something they never have time or clarity to build:

* **An externalised view of their internal mess**
* **A roadmap of what’s fixable, and how much it costs them not to fix it**
* **A low-risk, fast process to reach operational clarity**

That insight is valuable because:

* It directly relates to time, stress, and money
* No one in the company will ever do it
* It’s a neutral, structured snapshot—not opinionated consulting

And if they trust your diagnosis, they’ll gladly pay you to implement it.

## IV. Your Actual Work (per project)

| Task                              | Time      | Tools                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Book & run intake call            | 30–45 min | Google Meet, Otter.ai        |
| Clean and summarise inputs        | 1 h       | GPT-4o                       |
| Draft process map + summary       | 1.5 h     | Notion, diagrams             |
| Identify issues and propose fixes | 1 h       | Manual, backed by GPT        |
| Format output (PDF + Notion)      | 2 h       | Canva, Adobe Express, Notion |
| Record Loom + send                | 30 min    | Loom, email                  |

**Total: \~6–7 hours** per project
Net value to the client: €3–10k/month in efficiency gains

---

## V. You Are Valuable Because:

* You **see patterns** they can’t articulate
* You **structure messy workflows** into clarity
* You **propose focused, practical changes**—not theory
* You **deliver insight at speed**, powered by AI, packaged professionally

---

If you want, I’ll provide:

* A ready-to-use intake questionnaire (print + form)
* A Notion audit template (with sample output structure)
* Prompt pack for GPT to extract processes from transcript

This model is **100 % learnable, executable, and immediately monetisable** even as a first-time operator—if you execute clearly and deliver structured outputs.
