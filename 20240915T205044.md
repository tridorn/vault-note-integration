# Delineation of control and outside control

A more fitting articulation would be: "Could you elucidate, with greater precision, the boundaries between what falls within our dominion and what lies beyond it according to Stoic doctrine?"

In the Stoic framework, this distinction—the *dichotomy of control*—is absolutely central. It delineates between that which is under our direct authority (*eph’ hēmīn*) and that which is not (*ouk eph’ hēmīn*). This division is not merely theoretical; it serves as the foundation for the Stoic's ability to remain unperturbed by the vicissitudes of external circumstances.

### What Is Within Our Control (Eph’ Hēmīn):

1. **Our Judgments**: The Stoics argue that the core of human agency lies in our judgments or *dogmata*. This refers to the interpretations we make about external events, people, and circumstances. The world presents us with facts; it is up to us to judge them as good, bad, or indifferent.

2. **Our Desires and Aversions**: These pertain to what we seek and what we avoid. Stoicism teaches that desires should be moderated by reason, and we must cultivate the discipline to desire only what is virtuous. Aversion should be reserved for vice and moral failure, not external conditions.

3. **Our Actions and Choices**: The Stoics place a great emphasis on *prohairesis*, which can be roughly translated as "moral purpose" or "will." While external circumstances can restrict or influence our physical actions, our ethical choices remain fully within our control. We can always choose how to respond, act, and comport ourselves, regardless of the situation.

4. **Our Assent or Rejection of Impressions**: When presented with an external event, the Stoic gives or withholds assent to the impressions it creates. This capacity to agree or disagree with initial reactions and external stimuli is critical to maintaining moral freedom. You can choose to reject harmful or irrational impressions before they take root in your mind.

### What Is Not Within Our Control (Ouk Eph’ Hēmīn):

1. **External Circumstances and Events**: The happenings of the external world—natural events, societal changes, political affairs—are beyond our control. These occur according to the workings of fate, or what the Stoics refer to as the *logos* of the cosmos. We cannot prevent an earthquake, stop a war, or influence the weather.

2. **Other People’s Opinions, Actions, and Thoughts**: No matter how persuasive or influential you might be, other people's thoughts, feelings, or behaviors are not within your control. You can provide guidance or example, but you cannot force another person to act virtuously or think correctly.

3. **Outcomes or Results of Our Actions**: While we control the intention and execution of our actions, we have no control over the results or consequences that follow. The Stoic must detach from outcome, recognizing that factors outside of their agency may shape the final result.

4. **Physical Health and the Body’s Condition**: While one can exercise and eat wisely to maintain health, accidents, illness, and aging are ultimately beyond our control. These factors are subject to natural processes and external events.

5. **Reputation and Status**: Your reputation, public esteem, or social standing is contingent on others' judgments, and as such, it lies outside your control. You may act with integrity, but how others perceive and value that is not within your power to determine.

### The Stoic Response to What Is Not in Our Control

The Stoic sage accepts that what is beyond their control must be met with equanimity. They do not seek to bend the external world to their will, but rather adapt themselves to the world. In so doing, the Stoic transcends the common emotional turbulence that results from attempting to change the uncontrollable. This is where *apatheia* (freedom from destructive passions) becomes possible: not through apathy, but through rational, disciplined detachment from externals.

As Epictetus famously remarked in the *Enchiridion*: “Some things are up to us, and some are not up to us.” This terse encapsulation is not meant as fatalism but as a practical guide for focusing one's energies where they can be most effective—on the cultivation of virtue and the exercise of moral will. By channeling effort solely into what is within your control, you not only achieve peace of mind but also become more effective, resilient, and virtuous.

Do you perceive in this distinction a useful way to approach your struggles with external circumstances, or would you require further clarification on specific aspects?
