**Refined version of your request:** _"Outline a high-level documentation schema that comprehensively captures and governs the full operational model--cadence system, organizational architecture, planning logic, governance stack, roles, and flows--without yet defining individual artefacts or templates."_
* * *

## HIGH-LEVEL DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE

_This is not a file structure. It is the skeletal _doctrine_--the map of all institutional knowledge that must be codified to make the system legible, operational, and teachable._

* * *

### I. **Foundational Doctrine** _(Why the system exists and what it is)_

| Section | Purpose | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Philosophy & Principles** | Central beliefs: autonomy, clarity, mission-first, etc. | 
| **Design Logic** | Rationale behind decentralised execution, FO role, Council/SO separation | 
| **Strategic Planning Model** | How intent is formed, framed, translated (Council → SO → Missions) | 
| **Decision-Making Doctrine** | How decisions are made, escalated, delegated | 
| **Authority Model** | Definitions of ownership, accountability, veto rights | 
* * *

### II. **Temporal Framework** _(Cadence layer)_

| Section | Purpose | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Cadence Hierarchy** | Pulse → Sprint → Mission → Program → Campaign → Season | 
| **Rhythmic Governance Points** | What is reviewed/decided when (e.g. quarterly resets, Mission retros) | 
| **Linking Cadence to Operations** | How each execution layer maps to time containers | 
* * *

### III. **Structural Architecture** _(Execution and support roles)_

| Section | Purpose | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Unit Definitions** | Mission, Program, Campaign, etc.--what each does and doesn't do | 
| **Team Types** | Execution (Missions), Support (SDs), Coordination (FOs), Governance (SO) | 
| **Field Officer Doctrine** | Mandate, limits, rituals, typical intervention patterns | 
| **Support Divisions Protocols** | Engagement models, escalation, SLAs, compliance responsibilities | 
| **Command Stack** | Council composition, domain mandate, decision scope | 
| **Strategic Operations** | Planning cycle, campaign architecture, doctrine management | 
* * *

### IV. **Flows & Interfaces** _(How information and authority move)_

| Section | Purpose | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Planning Flow** | From long-range strategy to Mission objectives | 
| **Feedback Flow** | From Missions → FO → SO → IH → Council | 
| **Intel Processing Chain** | IH ingestion, classification, distribution, decision impact | 
| **Logistics & Resourcing Flow** | How Missions request, receive, and return support/resources | 
| **Coordination Mechanics** | How Missions under the same Campaign or Program sync up | 
* * *

### V. **Governance & Review Mechanisms**

| Section | Purpose | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Review Rituals** | Sprint reviews, Mission retros, Program boards, Council sessions | 
| **Performance Model** | How units and people are evaluated (qualitative + quantitative) | 
| **Escalation Protocols** | Rules for breaking autonomy (e.g. FO override, Council veto) | 
| **Doctrine Evolution** | Versioning, amendment process, triggers for structural change | 
* * *

### VI. **Role Compendium** _(Not org chart--functional doctrine of every seat)_

| Section | Purpose | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Role Mandates** | For each formal seat: Council members, SO units, FO, SD leads, Mission leaders | 
| **Accountability Grid** | RACI across planning, execution, review, escalation | 
| **Succession & Delegation** | Continuity models, proxy authority, redundancy design | 
* * *

### VII. **Meta-System Design** _(System that governs the system)_

| Section | Purpose | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **System Entry/Exit** | How Missions are launched and retired, how SDs are created or merged | 
| **System Scaling Rules** | When and how new Programs, Campaigns, or Cadence levels are introduced | 
| **Audit & Self-Diagnosis** | How the structure audits itself, identifies entropy or misalignment | 
| **Digital Infrastructure Binding** | How systems (CRM, PM tools, dashboards) enforce this architecture | 
* * *

### Conclusion

This schema outlines what _must exist_ for your system to function as an institutional operating model--not just as a method. Without formalising this top-layer doctrine, your structure will default to oral transmission and fail under personnel turnover or scaling stress. Only once this is in place does artefact design, digital system integration, or day-to-day tooling become meaningful.
