### **Friday: Explosiveness & Agility (The Tiger’s Strike)**  
Friday is dedicated to **explosive power, speed, and agility**, reflecting the tiger's ability to strike with precise and overwhelming force. This workout focuses on plyometric calisthenics, dynamic coordination, and core stability for swift, sharp movements.

**Goal**: Build fast-twitch muscle fibers, improve reaction time, and enhance athletic agility.  
**Duration**: ~60-75 minutes.
