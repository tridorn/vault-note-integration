Your explanation could be articulated as: "In Apple Reminders, I use project-level reminders to represent overarching projects, sub-reminders for tasks and iterations, with iterations dated to the end of each week (akin to sprints). My goal is to deliver an MVP for the entire project within each iteration, refining incrementally. For tasks, I’m considering adding an expected outcome or minimal outcome in the notes, along with bullet points for actionable MVPs—potentially better termed as 'deliverables' or 'steps.' What terminology and structure would optimize this system?"

### Refined Structure for Apple Reminders with MVP Thinking

#### **1. Key Terminology and Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, I recommend adopting the following terms:
- **Project**: The overarching goal or initiative (e.g., "Website Redesign").
- **Iteration**: A weekly milestone representing the sprint toward an MVP of the project.
- **Task**: A specific action or responsibility contributing to the project or iteration (e.g., "Design homepage layout").
- **Outcome**: The *minimal functional result* expected from a task (e.g., "Homepage wireframe").
- **Deliverables**: Tangible outputs or substeps required to achieve the outcome (e.g., "Draft wireframe," "Review feedback").
- **Why 'Deliverables'**? This term emphasizes the tangible, actionable nature of MVP thinking better than 'steps,' which may suggest a broader process rather than specific outputs.

### **2. Implementation in Apple Reminders**

Here’s how you can structure and manage projects, iterations, and tasks:

#### **A. Project-Level Reminders**

- **Title**: Use clear, outcome-focused project titles.
- Example: "Website Redesign: Functional MVP by Dec. 15."
- **Notes**: Include a brief description of the project goal, key milestones, and the definition of 'done' for the project MVP.
- Example:

```
Goal: Deliver an MVP website with basic pages (Home, About, Contact) and functional navigation.
Definition of Done: MVP is functional for demonstration by Dec. 15.
```

#### **B. Iterations as Sub-Reminders**

- **Title**: Name iterations with their purpose and timeframe.
- Example: "Iteration 1: Core wireframes (Dec. 4–Dec. 11)."
- **Date**: Set due dates to the end of the sprint.
- **Notes**: Add the expected MVP outcome for the iteration.
- Example:

```
Iteration Goal: Create wireframes for core pages (Home, About, Contact).
Deliverables:
- Draft Home wireframe.
- Draft About wireframe.
- Draft Contact wireframe.
```

#### **C. Tasks as Actionable Sub-Reminders**

- **Title**: Name tasks descriptively, focusing on action.
- Example: "Draft Home wireframe."
- **Date**: Set realistic deadlines within the sprint timeframe.
- **Notes**: Define the **Expected Outcome** and **Deliverables**:
- Example:

```
Expected Outcome: Usable wireframe for the Home page.
Deliverables:
- Sketch layout draft.
- Add placeholders for text and images.
- Share draft for feedback.
```

### **3. Weekly Workflow with Iterations**

#### **A. Weekly Planning**

1. **Define Iteration MVP**:
- Start the week by specifying the iteration MVP in the iteration reminder.
- Example: "Iteration 1: Core wireframes (Dec. 4–Dec. 11)." Expected MVP: Usable wireframes for three core pages.

1. **Break Iteration into Tasks**:
- Add sub-reminders under the iteration for each major task.
- For each task:
- Title: Action-focused.
- Notes: Include **Expected Outcome** and **Deliverables**.

1. **Prioritize Tasks**:
- Reorder tasks based on importance and dependency (e.g., complete homepage wireframe before the About page).

#### **B. Execution During the Week**

1. **Focus on Outcomes**:
- When working on a task, prioritize achieving the **Expected Outcome** rather than perfecting the deliverables.
- Example: If the "Draft Home wireframe" task is time-boxed, focus on producing a functional draft, even if visuals are placeholders.

1. **Iterative Progress**:
- Move completed tasks to a "Done" list within the iteration.
- For incomplete tasks, note why they remain unfinished and allocate time in the next iteration.

#### **C. End-of-Week Review**

1. **Evaluate the Iteration MVP**:
- Review the iteration reminder to confirm whether the MVP outcome was met. If not, identify bottlenecks or scope issues.
- Example: "Did we deliver usable wireframes for all three pages?"

1. **Carry Over Incomplete Tasks**:
- Move unfinished tasks to the next iteration with adjusted notes for priority or scope.

1. **Refine Next Iteration**:
- Set up the next iteration reminder, adjusting scope based on lessons from the previous sprint.

### **4. Adjustments and Best Practices**

#### **A. Minimal Outcome as a Mindset**

- Shift your focus to *minimum functionality* rather than perfection at every stage.
- Example: For "Draft Home wireframe," the minimal outcome is a functional layout that communicates basic structure—not polished design.

#### **B. Context-Driven Iterations**

- Use iterations to address specific aspects of the project:
- Iteration 1: "Core structure" (basic layouts, navigation).
- Iteration 2: "Content refinement" (text, visuals).
- Iteration 3: "Final polish" (aesthetic enhancements, testing).

#### **C. Refine Task Language**

- Use action verbs and clarity in task titles:
- Instead of: "Home wireframe."
- Use: "Sketch Home layout" or "Review Home wireframe draft."

#### **D. Use Smart Lists for Tracking**

- Apple Reminders allows smart lists based on tags, deadlines, or priorities:
- Tag iteration reminders with "Iteration."
- Tag tasks with "Deliverable."
- Create smart lists like "This Week’s Deliverables" or "High Priority."

#### **E. Review Deliverables at Each Step**

- After completing a deliverable, confirm it meets the minimal outcome:
- Example: For "Draft Home wireframe," check if the basic layout is complete and usable.

### **5. Example Workflow**

#### **Project: Website Redesign**

1. **Project Reminder**:
- Title: "Website Redesign: Functional MVP by Dec. 15."
- Notes:

```

Goal: Deliver MVP website with core pages (Home, About, Contact) and basic navigation.

```

1. **Iteration Reminder**:
- Title: "Iteration 1: Core wireframes (Dec. 4–Dec. 11)."
- Notes:

```

Iteration Goal: Usable wireframes for Home, About, Contact pages.  
Deliverables:
- Draft Home wireframe.
- Draft About wireframe.
- Draft Contact wireframe.

```

1. **Tasks**:
- Title: "Draft Home wireframe."
- Notes:

```

Expected Outcome: Usable wireframe for the Home page.  
Deliverables:
- Sketch layout draft.
- Add placeholders for text/images.
- Share draft for feedback.

```

- Title: "Draft About wireframe."
- Title: "Draft Contact wireframe."

### **Conclusion**

By integrating **Expected Outcome** and **Deliverables** into task notes, using iterations as weekly milestones, and focusing on MVPs for each project phase, you establish a highly structured yet agile workflow in Apple Reminders. This system ensures that every iteration delivers functional progress while retaining the flexibility to refine incrementally.
