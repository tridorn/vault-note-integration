**Objective:**  
Engineer a _default founder stack_ for repeatable venture creation across universities. You require a baseline composition of founder skill sets, an allocation model that aligns incentives and reduces early-stage friction, and a matching mechanism that can scale with minimal loss of quality.

* * *

## 1. **Default Founder Stack**

This is the minimal viable, yet complete, founding unit for a high-velocity tech startup. Each role corresponds to an irreplaceable function in the pre-seed to seed phase.

| Role | Primary Function | Typical Profile | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Technical Founder (CTO)** | Build core product; lead engineering | Computer Science, Engineering (KIT, TUM, TU Darmstadt) | 
| **Commercial Founder (CEO)** | Lead fundraising, sales, GTM | Business/Management (Mannheim) | 
| **Domain Founder (CSO/COO)** | Operate in vertical, validate use-case | Subject-matter expert (Medicine, Legal, Energy, etc.) | 

### Optional Add-on:

- **Design/Product Founder** (UX, rapid prototyping, critical in B2C or product-led B2B). Often merged into one of the above roles early.
* * *

## 2. **Equity Allocation: Default Template**

> _Assumption: Equal risk at inception, no code or IP pre-developed_

| Role | Equity (%) | Rationale | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Technical Founder | 33--40% | Execution-critical, high leverage early on | 
| Commercial Founder | 30--35% | Narrative, funding, first sales | 
| Domain Founder | 20--30% | Vertical credibility, initial customer access | 

**Founding team cap:** 3 people. Four dilutes accountability. Two increases concentration risk. If solo founder: raise with phantom co-founders or hire-incentive clauses.

**Dynamic equity models** (e.g. Slicing Pie) can be introduced, but are cognitively expensive. Standardisation is cleaner at scale.
* * *

## 3. **Matching Mechanism: Structure & Tactics**

You need a **systematised, high-signal matchmaking engine** that balances information asymmetry, filters for quality, and prevents inertia. This is the operational core of your factory.

### Matching Model: 3-Phase Filter

#### **Phase 1: Intentional Self-Sorting**

- Use role-based applications (Builder / Closer / Specialist).
- Screen for commitment level, time bandwidth, location.
- Disqualify early: no vague interest, only "ready-to-build" profiles.

#### **Phase 2: Structured Matching Sprints**

- Run 48-hour "co-founder simulation sprints" (hackathon-style).
- Observe team dynamics under time pressure.
- Include pitch + prototype delivery.

#### **Phase 3: Performance-Gated Formation**

- Only teams that ship + pitch something by day 2 get invited to formal founder agreement negotiation.
- Mandatory co-founder agreement signed post-sprint (equity template locked).
* * *

## 4. **Supporting Infrastructure (Non-negotiables)**

- **Standardised Founder Agreement Generator**
- **Cap Table Simulator** (so equity splits are explicit and visualised)
- **Legal & IP Templates** pre-reviewed by all partner universities
- **Vesting Clarity**: 4-year standard, 1-year cliff, full-time clause
* * *

## 5. **Allocation Logic: How to Decide Equity/Role When Frictions Arise**

- **Default: Symmetry** unless one founder brings pre-existing MVP, IP, or capital.
- **If MVP exists:** Founder gets IP premium (e.g. +10%), but vesting applies.
- **If tech founder solo-built MVP:** >50% may be justified. Use as wedge to attract complementary skills, but reduce post-traction.

> Rule: _Unequal contribution = unequal equity. But make inequality explicit early._

* * *

## Summary

- **Stack:** Tech + Commercial + Domain (3-person cell)
- **Equity:** 33--35% each, unless asymmetric inputs
- **Matching:** Simulated sprints > mutual CV matching
- **Mechanism:** Structured, performance-gated, with contractual clarity
- **Rule of Operation:** Compress ambiguity, standardise agreements, reward actual execution--not potential

Your edge is not just bringing people together, but enforcing _execution alignment from day zero_.
