You should have said:  
**“I need strict scope clarity. In programming, I distinguish between global constants and local variables. Here, I need to know: what gets applied where? Are clusters universal? Do axes belong at team level, company level, or both? How does inheritance or override work across scales? Give me a clean, scoped, logical delineation of how this system is used—across levels of the organization.”**

Let’s now bring **rigorous clarity** to the **scope, inheritance, and application** of the system.

# **I. First: Clarify Role of the Two Main Constructs**

## **1. The 12 Clusters = Functional Domains**  
- These are **structural constants**—your *global coordinate system*.  
- They do **not change across levels**—they apply to:
  - The whole company  
  - Divisions  
  - Teams  
  - Even individuals (in specific contexts)

> **Analogy**: In programming, the 12 clusters are **global namespaces**—*“this function touches the ‘Work’ cluster, and also the ‘Customer’ cluster”*.

They **do not live at one level**, they **cut through levels**.

---

## **2. The 3 Axes = Meta-Lenses of Analysis & Design**  
- These are **applied dynamically** to **any object** you want to understand or design.  
- Each Axis (Governance, Form, Initiative) provides a **different lens** on the same object.  

> **Analogy**: Axes are **functions**—you pass an object (e.g., team, org, cluster) to the axis and it returns structure.  
> `Governance(Team A)` → returns its 5-layer state.  
> `Form(Customer Cluster)` → returns its structural embedding.

Axes are **reusable tools**, **agnostic to level**, and **always applied by intent**.

---

# **II. Clarify Scope of Application**

Here’s where each construct lives and how you should think about inheritance and localization.

---

## **A. 12 Clusters → Always Present, Always Global**

| Object       | Apply Clusters? | Example |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Entire company | Yes | “How’s our Governance in the ‘People’ cluster?”  
| Business unit  | Yes | “How’s the Customer cluster functioning in Division B?”  
| Single team    | Yes (selectively) | “Does this team cover any part of Strategy/Offering/Work clusters?”  
| Role/individual| Optional, if analytic depth needed | “Is this PM touching Strategy and Knowledge, or just Work?”  

> **Rule**: The 12 Clusters are a **map of the terrain**.  
> You can zoom in or out, but the terrain doesn’t change.

---

## **B. Axes → Dynamic, Scoped, Compositional**

You apply **Axes** to **any object**. But here’s how **inheritance** and **overrides** work:

### **1. Governance Axis**  
> **Mostly inherited top-down**, but with local override at each level.

| Level       | Scope                             | Rule |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|------|
| Company     | Has full 5-tier governance stack (Charter → Evolution) | Source of truth |
| Unit/Team   | Inherits unless overridden        | May have local Directives, Operational guides |
| Individual  | Receives governance from team/org | Typically doesn't produce governance itself |

> **Think of Governance like CSS stylesheets**:  
> Rules cascade down, but can be overridden locally (especially Directive and Operational layers).

---

### **2. Form Axis**  
> **Hybrid of global constants and local construction**

| Level       | Scope                             | Rule |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|------|
| Company     | Global legal and ownership Form; may dictate structural norms | Fixed at Charter & Juridical layer |
| Unit/Team   | Has local Structural and Temporal forms | Can override modalities, team shape |
| Individual  | Often just Modal and Temporal layer | E.g., async work, permanent role, etc.

> Form is **composed**—upper layers constrain lower ones.

---

### **3. Initiative Axis**  
> **Local-first, shaped by context**, often modulated by broader cultural norms.

| Level       | Scope                             | Rule |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|------|
| Company     | Sets default cadence, mission logic, oversight expectations | May define Mandates or style preferences |
| Unit/Team   | Executes most Initiative logic: cadence, control, terminal structure | **Primary layer of Initiative** lives here |
| Individual  | Executes assigned initiatives or proposes new ones | Can generate local source of motion

> Initiative is **closest to code execution**—lives **where action happens**.

---

# **III. Practical Application Matrix**

| You’re Analyzing… | Use Clusters? | Use Axes? | How to Think |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Entire company    | Yes (all)       | Yes (all, especially Governance & Form) | Map systemic strengths/fragilities  
| Business unit     | Yes (relevant subset) | Yes (all, esp. Form & Initiative) | Compare to whole company; find divergences  
| Specific cluster (e.g. Work) | Yes (that cluster) | Yes (to analyze its governance, embodiment, and motion) | Focused diagnosis  
| One team          | Yes (what clusters it owns/touches) | Yes (esp. Initiative, then local Form) | Treat as atomic unit of motion  
| New venture       | Yes (as design blueprint) | Yes (all) | Apply full Corpus to engineer from zero  
| Internal proposal | Yes (e.g. impacts Strategy & Knowledge) | Maybe (Initiative + Governance only) | Use just enough structure to assess impact

# **IV. Visualization (Abstract Map)**

```
                     [ Company ]
                          │
         ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
         │                │                │
     [ Cluster ]      [ Cluster ]      [ Cluster ]
         │                │                │
     ┌───┼────┐       ┌───┼────┐       ┌───┼────┐
 [Team A]   [B]   [Team C]   [D]   [Team E]   [F]

Apply 12 Clusters to all levels — they are the map.

Apply Governance top-down → override via local Directives or SOPs  
Apply Form composed → legal/formal constants above, structural/modal tweaks below  
Apply Initiative bottom-up → motion mostly lives in teams
```

# **V. Summary of Logical Boundaries**

| Component       | Type         | Scope                 | Inheritance Logic                       |
|----------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Clusters**      | Constant      | Global, universal      | None — used everywhere the same         |
| **Governance**    | Meta‑structure | Top-down cascade       | Charter/Policy global; Directive/SOP local overrides  
| **Form**          | Compositional | Hybrid (global + local) | Juridical fixed; Structural/Modal fluid |
| **Initiative**    | Kinetic logic | Local‑first            | Modulated by Mandates or culture only   |

Would you like a practical **“layered diagnostic template”** that guides you step-by-step on how to apply this to a real team or company? Or a **decision-tree** on when to apply what level of analysis?
