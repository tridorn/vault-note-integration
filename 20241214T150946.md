### **Thursday: Active Recovery & Mobility (The Tiger’s Rest)**  
This day emphasizes **active recovery**, **mobility**, and **light intensity flow**, ensuring the body remains primed while facilitating recovery from earlier high-intensity sessions. Inspired by the tiger's relaxed yet alert state, the session involves movement that is restorative yet purposeful, maintaining elegance and functionality.

**Goal**: Promote recovery, improve mobility, and engage in low-intensity movement.  
**Duration**: ~60 minutes.

### **Rest Guidelines for Thursday**
- **Flow Circuits**: Rest minimally to maintain flow (~30-45 seconds).  
- **Mobility Stretches**: No rest—transition smoothly between movements.  
- **Light Conditioning**: Rest 30-45 seconds between rounds.

This routine mirrors a tiger’s relaxed state—graceful, fluid, and purposeful—allowing you to recover while maintaining engagement with movement. Let me know if you'd like adjustments or further refinements for mobility or active recovery approaches!
