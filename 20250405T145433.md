**Better phrased:**  
Simulate the backlash. Where does the New Order falter? Which cities spit on the flame, mock the eagle, refuse the oath? How does a visionary like Vitellius confront resistance—not with petty brutality, but with *imperial choreography* that transforms defiance into spectacle, and terror into loyalty?

We begin with three resistance scenarios—each of escalating sophistication—and Vitellius’ corresponding countermeasures.

---

## **I. The Naïve Defiance – Lugdunum (Gaul)**

### **Situation:**
A provincial city with senatorial roots and Gallic pride. The local elite delays the Proclamation ceremony under the pretense of *festival scheduling*. The crowd murmurs against the new titles. A centurion is found murdered with "ROMA NON FLAMMA" carved into his chest.

### **Imperial Response:**
1. **Theater of Obedience.**
   - A second envoy arrives—not with messengers, but with a **legionary detachment and a portable tribunal stage**.
   - The *local magistrate* is summoned to a public oath ceremony. When he hesitates, he is declared in *ritual exile*, stripped of titles, and replaced *on the spot* by a Flamen of the Flame.

2. **The Death Made Useful.**
   - The murdered centurion becomes a martyr: **“First Blood of the New Flame.”**
   - A shrine is erected at the site of his death. Coins minted with his name.  
   - Every Gaul must pass the shrine on market day. A forced reminder: Rome does not mourn its dead. It turns them into *icons*.

3. **Message to the West.**
   - The Senate reads a declaration praising the “swift correction and purification of Lugdunum.”
   - Other Gallic towns double their oath ceremonies out of fear. **The flame spreads faster because it met resistance.**

## **II. The Clandestine Plot – Antioch (Syria)**

### **Situation:**
Priests of ancient Syrian temples view the Imperial Cult as blasphemous. Secret meetings begin between disgruntled Roman officers and local religious leaders. A faction plans to **delay oath ceremonies**, hoping for Vespasian’s return to rally the East.

### **Imperial Response:**
1. **The Scripted Betrayal.**
   - Vitellius’ frumentarii plant **false messages** suggesting the plot is a trap—causing the ringleaders to **turn on each other**. Two are found dead before the Empire lifts a finger.
   - One surviving plotter is “captured” in a *very public arrest*, gagged with a scroll containing prayers to Vespasian.

2. **Trial as Ritual.**
   - The traitor is executed not in secret—but on the **Temple Steps**, in a *silent ritual*. His body is burned, and the ashes are **mixed into the mortar of a new Imperial Altar**.
   - The message: *Your resistance feeds the Empire.*

3. **Religious Reconciliation by Design.**
   - The Emperor *“pardons”* the people of Antioch. He allows **local gods to be honored—as long as Roma and Imperator are above them**.
   - A syncretic priesthood is installed. “*Roma wears many faces, but only one crown.*”

## **III. The Political Insurrection – Carthago (Africa)**

### **Situation:**
A former senatorial stronghold, Carthage sees itself as a mirror to Rome. The governor refuses to accept the reclassification from *proconsul* to *imperial deputy*. A full-scale rebellion brews. Graffiti mocks the Emperor. The local cohort defects.

### **Imperial Response:**
1. **No Mercy, Only Memory.**
   - Vitellius sends not just a legion, but **a chronicler**, an architect, and a Flamen.
   - Carthage is put under siege for **nine days**. After surrender, the **central forum is razed**, the city renamed **Colonia Nova Concordia**.
   - The **governor is paraded in chains in Rome**, then sacrificed symbolically during the Festival of Eternal Flame.

2. **Repopulation and Rebranding.**
   - Thousands of loyal veterans and freedmen are granted land within the new colony. They form the **First Concordian Council**, directly under the Emperor.
   - The original Carthaginian elite is scattered across the empire, denied the right to gather in groups of more than three.

3. **The Inscription of Humility.**
   - On the ruins of the old Carthaginian senate house, a single line is carved:
     > *“He who defies the Flame shall feed it.”*

## **Patterns of Imperial Doctrine in Response to Resistance**

| Resistance Type     | Strategy Name         | Key Principles                         | Outcome Mechanism             |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Open Hesitation     | *Theater of Obedience*| Humiliation + Replacement              | Public compliance             |
| Secret Conspiracy   | *Scripted Betrayal*   | Divide + Ritualize + Co-opt            | Mythologized suppression      |
| Armed Insurrection  | *No Mercy, Only Memory*| Annihilation + Colonization            | Erasure + Reinvention         |

**Vitellius does not merely defeat rebellion. He *uses it* to harden the regime.** Every act of resistance becomes a tale, a warning, a brick in the new Rome.

Would you like to simulate how this model holds up over 5–10 years? Or develop secret opposition networks and test how well Vitellius’ surveillance system responds?
