Your phrase could be more elegantly rephrased as:  
*"The most assured path to victory in games of chance is to orchestrate them oneself."*  

Now, as a **medieval ruler**, setting up a **gambling operation** to **maximize profit** would require a blend of **monopoly control, psychological manipulation, and systemic revenue extraction** while avoiding social destabilization. Below is a structured approach:

---

### **1. Establishing Legitimacy and Monopoly**
- **Declare Royal Privilege**:  
  - Gambling should be proclaimed a **regulated activity** under the Crown’s exclusive domain. This avoids underground operations siphoning profits.
  - Issue a **royal decree** forbidding unauthorized gambling, branding it as either illegal or "unblessed" by the church.
  
- **License Gambling Houses**:  
  - Rather than running it directly, grant **franchises** to trusted nobles or guilds, ensuring a steady flow of **licensing fees**.
  - Require operators to **pay a tax on earnings** or take a percentage of every game’s pot.

---

### **2. Game Selection and House Edge Engineering**
- **Dice and Card Games**:  
  - Standardize games where **the house has a fixed mathematical advantage** (e.g., early versions of dice games, precursor to blackjack).
  - Introduce **house rules that subtly tilt odds** in favor of the operator.

- **Lotteries and Raffles**:  
  - The simplest model is a **royal lottery** where peasants and nobility alike pay into a pool, but only a fraction is paid out.
  - Ensure the **biggest prizes are rare**, but publicize occasional wins to fuel participation.

- **Wagering on Combat or Sports**:  
  - **Jousting tournaments** and **bear-baiting pits** serve as excellent betting grounds.
  - The Crown takes a cut from **both bettors and event organizers**.

- **Fixed Games (Subtle Rigging)**:  
  - Employ skilled dealers who subtly manipulate outcomes.
  - Introduce **weighted dice or marked cards** for royal-controlled tables.
  - Control the **"house champions"** in sporting events who win just often enough to sustain interest.

---

### **3. Taxation and Revenue Streams**
- **Direct House Taxes**:  
  - Any gambling operation must remit a **fixed share of earnings** to the treasury.
  
- **Per-Bet Taxation**:  
  - A small percentage per wager (akin to a modern casino’s rake).
  
- **Debt Enforcement and Usury**:  
  - Royal creditors could lend money to gamblers at exorbitant interest.
  - Offer **pawn loans**, with the Crown seizing land, horses, or armor as collateral.

---

### **4. Sociopolitical Control Through Gambling**
- **Placate the Masses**:  
  - The **lower classes** gamble their frustrations away instead of fomenting rebellion.
  - Organize occasional **rigged public lotteries** where a commoner "wins" (an illusion of opportunity).
  
- **Corrupting Nobility**:  
  - Encourage **rival noble houses** to wager recklessly.
  - Ensure they **lose land, titles, and influence**, transferring wealth to the Crown.

- **Fund Wars or Expansions**:  
  - Revenue from gambling could fund mercenaries, siege engines, or bribes to foreign courts.

---

### **5. Avoiding Backlash**
- **Moral Cover via the Church**:  
  - Frame royal gambling as "God-sanctioned" entertainment.
  - Ensure clergy receive **a share of proceeds** in exchange for theological justification.

- **Ensure Noble Buy-In**:  
  - Let key nobles own stakes in the operation to prevent dissent.
  
- **Regulate Competition**:  
  - Permit small-scale, local gambling that is taxed but **does not threaten the royal monopoly**.
  - Crack down on rogue operators through **bribed enforcers** or **public executions** of unlicensed game-runners.

### **Conclusion: The Ultimate Royal Gambling Model**
A well-structured medieval gambling system would combine:
1. **Legal monopoly via the Crown**  
2. **Mathematically rigged games** favoring the house  
3. **Taxation on every layer** (entry fees, winnings, bets)  
4. **Debt enslavement and asset seizure**  
5. **Political benefits** (corrupting nobility, pacifying peasants)  
6. **Church endorsement for legitimacy**  

By implementing such a system, a medieval ruler would **profit immensely while maintaining control**, ensuring that the "game" always pays out—to the throne.
