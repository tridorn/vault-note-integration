### 1 First decision : **Which German vehicle—UG or GmbH, one-tier or two-tier?**  

| Criterion | **UG (haftungs-beschränkt)** | **GmbH** | **Why it matters at your stage** |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Minimum paid-in capital | **€ 1** (any amount < € 25 000) 【turn3search0】 | € 25 000 (§ 5 GmbHG) 【turn0search0】 | Keeps exit-tax base negligible while you validate the business. |
| Annual reserve lock-up | 25 % of net profit until € 25 000 reached (mandatory) 【turn6search2】 | None | Slows dividend extraction but forces equity build-up—a feature, not a bug, for financiers. |
| Image / credit-worthiness | Weak with sub-€5 000 capital | Stronger (banks, suppliers) | You can compensate with Swiss custody proof-of-funds when needed. |
| Cross-border conversion later | Allowed under EU Mobility Directive; no extra friction | Same | Both migrate in 2028 through a notarial plan + shareholder vote. |
| Cost to upgrade | one shareholders’ resolution once reserves ≥ € 25 000 | n/a | You can convert to GmbH *just before* moving abroad to freeze valuation. |

**Verdict** Start with a **lean UG**; upgrade or migrate only once (a) EBITDA soars or (b) you prepare the exit.

### 2 Single-tier **vs.** two-tier (“Holding-UG + Operating-UG”)

| Issue | Stand-alone UG | Holding-UG + Operating-UG |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Compliance footprint | one set of accounts | two sets, two tax filings |
| Tax on dividends to you | 26.375 % Abgeltungsteuer | **95 % exempt** at holding (§ 8b KStG) → effective ≈ 1.5 % CIT/TT 【turn4search0】 |
| Future share sale | 60 % taxable to individual | **95 % tax-free** gain inside holding |
| Exit-tax exposure | Business + IP value sit in the same entity | Value accumulates in OpCo; Holding shares stay low until migration |
| Setup cash | € 1 000 ≈ | € 2 000 (two UGs) |

**Executive rule** If you expect **> €200 k** annual profit inside three years, create **two UGs** from day 1. Otherwise stay single-tier to conserve cash and add a holding just before your exit-tax valuation date.

### 3 Concrete set-up sequence (German residency years 1-3)

| Week | Action | Purpose | Non-reversible pitfalls to avoid |
|------|--------|---------|----------------------------------|
| 1–2 | Draft *Musterprotokoll* or bespoke articles for **UG**. Insert a clause empowering a 75 % vote to move the seat abroad. | Legal foundation for later cross-border conversion. | Failing to include seat-transfer authority → you’d need unanimous consent later. |
| 3 | Notary appointment, capital deposit (€ 1 000–€ 5 000 recommended). | Formal incorporation (§ 5a GmbHG). | Under-capitalising (€ 1) screams “shell” to banks and auditors. |
| 4 | Register for Körperschaft- & Gewerbesteuer; choose low trade-tax municipality (< 11 %). | Cuts annual tax drag by up to 5 pp. | Moving later within Germany reopens tax-office audits. |
| 4–6 | Open fintech account (Qonto/Penta). | Operating liquidity. | Mixing private and business funds → *verdeckte Gewinnausschüttung* risk 【turn0search1】. |
| 6 | Sign **IP-licence** from *you* to the UG (6 % of revenue cap, arm’s-length). | Keeps IP outside Germany for future migration. | Transferring IP into UG now → exit-tax nightmare. |
| 8 | Optional: incorporate **Holding-UG**, subscribe shares in OpCo, file § 8b holding declaration with tax office. | Locks in 95 % dividend & capital-gain exemption and a low-value cap table at holding level. | Forgetting § 9 Nr 2a GewStG 15 % rule: holding must own ≥ 15 % all year to cut trade tax on dividends 【turn5search0】. |
| Quarterly | Board minutes + conservative DCF valuation memo. | Creates audit trail for exit-tax negotiations. | No valuations → tax office will impose aggressive multiple in 2028. |

### 4 Swiss custody bolt-on (when cash ≥ € 250 k)

1. **Onboard** with a Swiss private bank (Julius Baer, Pictet, Lombard Odier).  
2. Fund the account from UG profits that have been **after-tax** distributed (26 % withholding) *or* lent out at arm’s-length.  
3. Pledge the statement as *proof-of-funds* when opening UAE structures in 2027–28.  
4. Upon migration, **re-title** the account to your new UAE holding; no German reporting afterwards.

### 5 Decision matrix—upgrade points

| Trigger | Move | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Shareholder equity** > € 25 k | Convert UG → GmbH **before** you leave. | Banks and acquirers favour GmbH; valuation freeze happens at a cleaner legal form. |
| **EBITDA margin** ≥ 20 % and cash ≥ € 100 k | Spawn Holding-UG if not yet done. | Starts tax-efficient dividend streaming and shields future sale proceeds. |
| **Recurring cross-border sales** > 30 % revenue | Add foreign branch (PE) instead of new company while you’re still resident. | Keeps management & control clearly in Germany, avoids hidden-PE disputes. |
| **Crypto / high-risk ventures** | Do **not** house inside German UG. wait for Cayman/SPC post-exit. | Saves you BaFin licensing and unpredictable tax timing. |

### 6 Key legal-technical guardrails

- **Reserve rule**: 25 % of profit to *Gewinnrücklage* until € 25 k (§ 5a III). Skipping it = grounds for personal liability.  
- **No Sacheinlagen** in a UG. All capital must be cash (§ 5a II).  
- **Shareholder loans** must carry market interest; otherwise *verdeckte Gewinnausschüttung* ➔ add-back to taxable profit 【turn0search1】.  
- **Management location**: keep board meetings, key decisions, and accounting in Germany until you formally relocate—else risk dual residence taxation.

## Tactical Recommendation

1. **Incorporate a single UG now** at € 5 000 capital with relocation clause.  
2. **Externalise IP** via licence; build a clean valuation file every quarter.  
3. **Add Holding-UG** the moment retained earnings approach € 200 k or an investor conversation starts.  
4. **Open Swiss custody** once liquid assets hit ~€ 250 k; park excess cash there.  
5. Freeze valuation, convert to GmbH, and execute cross-border move once the 183-day German residency clock stops in 2028.

Follow this cadence and every euro of enterprise value created between now and departure will travel abroad with minimal fiscal leakage and maximum structural flexibility.
