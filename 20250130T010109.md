"Should the goal be aligned with the left column and the questions with the right one? Should I, as in your example, write 'Title:' followed by the title or just the title itself?"

Let’s break this down into two parts: the **alignment** of the goals and questions, and whether to include labels like "Title" or just write the elements themselves.

### 1. **Alignment: Should Goals and Questions Align with the Left and Right Columns?**

Yes, aligning the **goal** with the left column and the **questions** with the right column creates a visually balanced and logically structured layout. This alignment ensures that the goals remain connected with the **cue column**, where you later reflect on the material, and the questions align with the **main notes column**, guiding you to actively search for answers while taking notes.

#### **Why This Alignment works**

- **Left-side (Goals + Cue Column)**: Your goals act as a guidepost for deeper reflection and analysis, so placing them near the cue column makes sense. This helps you keep your overall objectives in mind as you process and question the material.
- **Right-side (Questions + Main Notes Column)**: Placing the questions near the main notes column visually ties your questions to the content. As you capture key points in the main notes section, you’ll naturally refer to your questions and search for answers.

#### **How To Structure This alignment**

- The **goal** is placed on the left side of the top section, aligned with the cue column.
- The **questions** are placed on the right side, aligned with the main notes column.

#### **Visual Example**

```
-------------------------------
| Time Management Strategies   |
| Goal: Understand time        | Questions:                        |
| allocation techniques        | - How to prioritize tasks?        |
|                              | - What are distraction techniques?|
-------------------------------
| Cue:                         | Main Notes:                       |
| - Pomodoro technique         | - The Pomodoro technique involves |
| - Eisenhower matrix          |  working in 25-min blocks with    |
|                              |  breaks in between.               |
|----------------------------- | ---------------------------------|
```

This alignment keeps the overall structure clean and intuitive, making it easier to navigate during both the note-taking process and review.

### 2. **Should You Use Labels (e.g., 'Title:' or Just the Title Itself)?**

This depends on **personal preference** and the level of formality you want in your notes. Let’s examine both options:

#### **Option 1: Using Labels (e.g., 'Title:', 'Goal:', 'Questions:')**

Using labels like "Title:", "Goal:", or "Questions:" can provide a clear structure, making it obvious at a glance what each section represents. This is useful in situations where you are taking notes on various types of content and want consistency.

- **Advantages**:
- Clear and structured.
- Easily scannable, especially when reviewing multiple sets of notes.
- Provides consistency across different types of notes.

- **When to use it**: 
- When you need a standardized format, especially for professional, academic, or collaborative purposes.
- If you want a **unified template** for all notes, where every session follows the same labeling system.

#### **Option 2: Without Labels (Just Writing the Title, Goal, and Questions)**

Skipping the labels and just writing the content directly (e.g., the title of the lecture, the goal, and the questions) can create a more streamlined, minimalist note style. This is often sufficient when the sections are clearly separated and you don’t need the extra clarity that labels provide.

- **Advantages**:
- Minimalist and clean.
- Saves space and time during note-taking.
- Less visually cluttered.

- **When to use it**:
- If you prefer a **more informal** style of note-taking, where the divisions are clear by their placement rather than labeling.
- For personal notes or when you’re quickly jotting down information and don’t want to be slowed down by adding labels.

#### **Examples**

With Labels:

```
Title: Time Management Strategies
Goal: Understand practical techniques for improving time allocation.
Questions:
- How to prioritize tasks?
- What are distraction techniques?
```

Without Labels:

```
Time Management Strategies
Understand practical techniques for improving time allocation.
- How to prioritize tasks?
- What are distraction techniques?
```

### **My Recommendation**

For **most cases**, I would recommend **using labels** like "Goal:" and "Questions:" to ensure clarity, especially when you're juggling various topics or if you plan to revisit the notes after some time. This will help you instantly recognize the structure without confusion.

However, if you're working on personal, quick, or highly informal notes, you can forgo the labels and keep things minimal. The key is maintaining a structure that works for your level of engagement and recall.

### Final Visual Layout (With Labels and Aligned with Columns)

Here’s how the Cornell system would look with the fourth section, labels, and the proper alignment of goals and questions:

```
-------------------------------
| Title: Time Management        |
| Goal: Understand time         | Questions:                        |
| allocation techniques         | - How to prioritize tasks?        |
|                               | - What are distraction techniques?|
-------------------------------
| Cue:                          | Main Notes:                       |
| - Pomodoro technique          | - The Pomodoro technique involves |
| - Eisenhower matrix           |  working in 25-min blocks with    |
|                               |  breaks in between.               |
|------------------------------ | ---------------------------------|
| Summary: The Pomodoro technique may not suit all tasks, but the   |
| Eisenhower matrix offers a clear prioritization method for        |
| urgent vs. important tasks. I will try applying the matrix to my  |
| next task review.                                                 |
-------------------------------
```

This structured approach ensures that your Cornell notes are organized, easy to navigate, and focused on achieving the goals and answering the questions you set at the beginning.
