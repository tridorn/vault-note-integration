# Things for More Autarky

Absolutely, let's break it down into actionable steps. Here's a system for immediate implementation towards greater autarky:

## Version 1

### 1. **Everyday Carry (EDC)**

What you carry daily can greatly influence how prepared and mobile you are:

- **Basic EDC**:
  - Wallet with essential ID, a credit card, and some cash.
  - Keychain with house/car keys.
  - A durable and compact multi-tool.
  - Smartphone, with essential apps and offline maps.
  - Compact power bank and charging cable.
  - Quality pen and small notebook.

- **Extended EDC (for those wanting more preparedness)**:
  - Small first-aid kit with basics (band-aids, pain relievers, antiseptic wipes).
  - Reusable water bottle and/or collapsible cup.
  - Flashlight or headlamp.
  - Portable utensil set (for impromptu meals).
  - Compact rain poncho or umbrella.

### 2. **Adopt A Digital Toolkit**

Being tech-savvy can aid in mobility and adaptability:

- **Cloud Storage**: Use services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or iCloud to have access to your files anywhere.
- **Productivity Apps**: Tools like Notion, Trello, or Todoist to manage tasks and projects.
- **Communication**: Ensure you have apps for video conferencing like Zoom or Microsoft Teams, especially if you work remotely.
- **Offline Maps**: Apps like Maps.me or Google Maps (offline mode) can be invaluable in unfamiliar locations.

### 3. **Financial Preparedness**

Having a sound financial strategy aids in mobility:

- **Digital Banking**: Use banks that offer comprehensive online services, allowing you to manage your finances from anywhere.
- **Mobile Payment**: Set up Apple Pay, Google Wallet, or similar to reduce reliance on physical cards.
- **Emergency Cash**: Always keep a small amount of cash on hand for places that don't accept digital payment.

### 4. **Develop A Flexible Routine**

- **Time Management**: Adopt a method (like the Pomodoro Technique) that can be applied anywhere.
- **Flexible Work/Study Space**: Have a backpack with essential work/study tools, so you can set up at a café, library, or park.

### 5. **Learn On-the-Go**

Being adaptable often means learning quickly:

- **Online Courses**: Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or Khan Academy allow you to learn almost anything from anywhere.
- **Reading**: Use apps like Audible or Kindle to always have access to books without the bulk.

### 6. **Physical Readiness**

- **Compact Exercise Gear**: Resistance bands, jump rope, or a yoga mat can fit in a bag, allowing you to work out anywhere.
- **Walking or Biking**: Consider these as primary modes of transport for shorter distances. It's healthy and often faster in crowded areas.

### 7. **Cultivate A Network**

- **Local Connections**: Always be open to making new acquaintances. They can offer local knowledge, resources, or even opportunities.
- **Online Communities**: Join forums or groups related to your interests, providing a sense of community regardless of your location.

### 8. **Mindset**

- **Openness to New Experiences**: Try new things often to build adaptability.
- **Mindfulness Practices**: Engage in meditation or journaling to stay grounded.

Remember, the key to autarky is not just being prepared, but also being adaptable. It's about striking a balance between having what you need and being able to adjust to what you encounter. Start by integrating these steps into your daily routine, and you'll be on your way to a more independent and flexible lifestyle.

## Version 2

Absolutely, let's break this down into actionable steps and daily practices for you:

### **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Audit Your Life**:
	- List out all your dependencies and commitments (financial, social, personal).
	- Identify which of these can be minimized, eliminated, or optimized.

2. **Declutter**:
	- Go through your belongings and get rid of things you don’t use or need.
	- The less stuff you have, the easier it is to be mobile and flexible.

3. **Financial Health Check**:
	- Aim to reduce debts.
	- Save for an emergency fund.
	- Consider ways to diversify income.

### **Daily Workflows**

1. **Morning Routine**:
	- Incorporate flexibility training or exercises to keep you agile.
	- Spend 5-10 minutes in mindfulness or meditation to cultivate adaptability.

2. **Daily Learning**:
	- Dedicate a small chunk of time to learning something new every day. This could be related to survival skills, financial tips, or any other area of interest.

3. **End-of-Day Review**:
	- Reflect on your day: Were there moments you felt overly dependent on something/someone? How can you address that?

### **Everyday Carry (EDC) for Mobility and Flexibility**

1. **Digital**:
	- Smartphone: Ensure it has essential apps like maps, digital wallet, and emergency contacts.
	- Lightweight laptop or tablet (if your work requires it).
	- Portable charger/power bank.

2. **Practical Tools**:
	- Multipurpose tool or Swiss Army knife.
	- Small flashlight.
	- Pen and small notebook or digital note-taking device.

3. **Personal Care**:
	- Hand sanitizer.
	- Compact first aid kit with basic meds, bandages, and any personal medication.
	- Reusable water bottle and a small snack (like a protein bar).

4. **Financial**:
	- Some cash (in case digital methods fail).
	- One or two main credit/debit cards (not your entire wallet).
	- Digital backups of important IDs in your phone (and a physical ID like a driver's license).

5. **Clothing**:
	- Depending on climate and personal needs: A light jacket, hat, or umbrella. Aim for versatile pieces that can handle multiple situations.

6. **Backup Essentials**: 
	- Keep a small bag at your residence (or in your car if you have one) that contains a change of clothes, some essential toiletries, and any other crucial items. This isn't for daily carry but for quick grabs if you need to be away unexpectedly.

7. **Digital Backups**:
	- Ensure your essential files are backed up to the cloud so you can access them anywhere.

Remember, the aim isn't necessarily to carry a lot but to carry wisely. Every person's EDC will differ based on their specific needs. Start with these basics, and as you go about your day, take note of what you consistently need but don’t have, and adjust accordingly. Over time, you'll optimize your EDC to best suit your unique lifestyle.
