Starting at **24**, you already have an established personality, habits, and worldview, which means the path to becoming **Askeladd-like** is different from a fresh start. Rather than shaping yourself from infancy, you must now **deliberately reconstruct elements of your mindset, strategy, and behavior** while leveraging the experiences and skills you already possess.  

This is a **philosophical and strategic transformation** rather than a simple skill acquisition. Askeladd’s power lies not in just his intelligence or charisma but in **his worldview and control over himself and others**.

### **1. Cultivate the Askeladd Mindset (The Core Philosophy)**
To think like Askeladd, you must **reframe how you perceive power, people, and the world itself**.  

✔ **Detach from sentimentality but not purpose** – Askeladd is pragmatic and unsentimental, yet he has an ideal he serves (Wales). Identify what **your version of "Wales"** is—what matters to you beyond the illusions people chase?  
✔ **Never act on impulse—control every move** – Emotions are tools, not masters. **Train yourself to suppress unproductive reactions** (anger, frustration, attachment) and replace them with calculated responses.  
✔ **Treat life as a battlefield** – Every interaction, conversation, and negotiation is a **game of positioning**. Learn to analyze dynamics in **real time**—who holds power? Who is pretending? Who can be moved?  

#### **Mental Exercises to Develop This Mindset:**
- **Before reacting to anything, ask:** "What would Askeladd do?"  
- **Practice detachment:** Observe emotions **without acting on them immediately**.  
- **Reframe challenges as strategic puzzles:** View obstacles not as problems but as **tests of maneuvering**.

### **2. Master Strategic Thinking (Think Five Moves Ahead)**
Askeladd's genius lies in **seeing beyond the immediate move**—he never acts without knowing how it affects the long game.  

✔ **Study real-world strategy:** Read *The Art of War*, *The Book of Five Rings*, *The 48 Laws of Power*, and *On War*—not just for knowledge, but to **actively apply** their principles.  
✔ **Play strategy-heavy games:** Chess, Go, poker, or *Crusader Kings*—anything that forces you to **think multiple moves ahead** while adapting dynamically.  
✔ **In every interaction, predict responses:** Begin **playing out scenarios in your head** before speaking—what will the other person say? What is the best way to steer the conversation?  

#### **Exercises to Develop This:**
- **In conversations, plan the next three exchanges before speaking.**  
- **Practice setting traps in arguments/debates**—lead people to conclusions **you want them to reach.**  
- **Engage in long-term social maneuvers:** Test **how small influences today shape future events.**

### **3. Master Emotional Control (Weaponize Composure)**
✔ **Never reveal your full emotions unless necessary** – Askeladd is unreadable; when he shows emotion, it is calculated. **Control your facial expressions, voice, and body language.**  
✔ **Observe people’s emotions while masking your own** – Study human behavior like a strategist—watch microexpressions, tone shifts, hesitation.  
✔ **Train in stress inoculation** – Get comfortable in **high-pressure environments** (public speaking, negotiations, conflict resolution) until you can remain **calm and collected no matter what.**  

#### **Exercises to Build This:**
- **Cold approach interactions** – Strike up conversations with strangers, practice **controlling your nerves while influencing the flow**.  
- **Sparring or controlled physical hardship** – Combat sports, endurance challenges, or **any physical trial that forces you to stay composed under pressure.**  
- **Practice deception** – Play social deduction games (*Mafia, Poker, Werewolf*), forcing yourself to **lie while maintaining composure.**

### **4. Manipulate Social & Power Dynamics (Control Perception)**
✔ **Control how people perceive you** – Askeladd **lets others believe what benefits him most.** Be selective about what you reveal, and **always have an intended effect** when sharing information.  
✔ **Learn to bait reactions** – Make others act impulsively while you remain calculated.  
✔ **Be versatile in roles** – Play the fool, the mentor, the warrior, the diplomat—**adopt different masks as needed.**  

#### **Exercises to Develop This:**
- **Adopt a deliberate social role in different groups** – Test how people treat you **based on how you present yourself.**  
- **Study leaders, manipulators, and salespeople in real life** – Observe how they **control conversations, steer emotions, and redirect topics.**  
- **Create controlled narratives about yourself** – Try **managing your reputation in different circles**, ensuring different people see different aspects of you.

### **5. Master the Art of the Long Game (Wield Influence Quietly)**
✔ **Never let people see your true hand** – Askeladd **never shows all his cards**, only what serves his goals at the moment.  
✔ **Control allies, but let them think they are free** – True power is making others believe they are acting on their own while furthering **your** agenda.  
✔ **Sacrifice the short-term to win the war** – Be willing to **delay gratification**, retreat when necessary, and **burn bridges when they have served their purpose.**  

#### **Exercises to Develop This:**
- **Start playing long-term social games** – See how **small shifts in perception today** change how people treat you **months later.**  
- **Test influencing decisions subtly** – Make suggestions in a way that **others think they arrived at the idea themselves.**  
- **Set "fake weaknesses"** – Let others believe you have an obvious flaw, so they **underestimate you and never see the real play.**

### **6. Develop a Ruthless Yet Principled Philosophy (Askeladd’s Code)**
✔ **Power is the only reality** – Morality is **a construct, but ideals can still be pursued** in secret.  
✔ **Never attach yourself to illusions (people, wealth, status)** – Keep **what is useful, discard what is dead weight.**  
✔ **Survival and domination require adaptability** – If one approach fails, shift tactics **immediately.**  

#### **Exercises to Develop This:**
- **Question all social norms you follow—are they serving you, or are you blindly following convention?**  
- **Identify illusions you’re attached to and detach from them consciously.**  
- **Actively reshape your personal philosophy over time, refining what power means to you.**

### **Final Verdict: The Path to Becoming Askeladd**
To transform into an **Askeladd-tier strategist**, you must:  
✔ **Control yourself before controlling others**—master composure, emotional detachment, and perception.  
✔ **Think in layers of deception and manipulation**—wield influence **without ever seeming like you are.**  
✔ **Become a ghost in the system**—powerful but unseen, always shaping events **from behind the scenes.**  
✔ **Embrace power as a tool, not a vanity**—you seek control, not for pleasure, but because **it is the only way to move freely in the world.**  

This is not an easy path, but it is one of **deliberate evolution**, requiring mastery over yourself, people, and power itself. 

**The question is no longer whether you admire Askeladd—the question is: do you have the will to become him?**
