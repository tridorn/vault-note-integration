# New Workflow Plan and Review Version 1

## Exposition

Sure, let's dive into how a half-hour session might look like in your updated system:

1. **Identify the Objective:** Start with determining what your session objective will be. This objective should align with your broader daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly objectives and could also come from your APAS system, where it may correspond to a task in a specific project or be linked to a specific area of your life.

2. **Define Key Results:** Once you've identified your objective, define what key results you want to see. These key results will help you know whether or not you've achieved your objective.

3. **Select Actions:** Now, look at your next actions list from the APAS system. Select tasks that align with the session objective and the key results you've defined. These tasks will be your primary focus for this half-hour session.

4. **Work on Actions:** Spend your half-hour session working on the actions you've selected. Be mindful of the time and aim to work effectively and efficiently to make progress toward your key results.

5. **Evaluate the Session:** At the end of the session, review your progress. Have you achieved the key results? If not, what held you back? Are there actions left uncompleted? If yes, you may need to roll these over into your next session or reassess your planning process.

6. **Record Data:** Finally, document your session data using the revised format we've discussed. This data will provide valuable insights into your productivity, effectiveness, and general work habits.

7. **Feed Back:** If you've completed a task that was part of a larger project in your APAS system, update the status of the task in that system. If you've made progress towards an objective from your TPS system, update that as well. This allows both systems to stay synced and reflect your most current progress.

8. **Plan for the Next Session:** Based on your current sessionâ€™s outcome, start thinking about what your next session's objective will be. You might continue with a related task, or switch focus to a different objective, depending on your larger goals.

Remember, your overarching system is a flexible tool - it's there to serve you, not the other way around. Use it in a way that supports your productivity and wellbeing, and feel free to adjust it as you go along.
