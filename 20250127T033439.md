Here’s a refined list of **billionaire principles**, solely focused on the mindset and practices that align with becoming a billionaire. These principles are stripped of Stoic influences and focus entirely on the **visionary, strategic, and wealth-building mindset** required for massive success:

---

### **1. Think in Decades, Not Days**

- **Principle**: Billionaires operate with a long-term perspective. They don’t make decisions based on short-term gains but on where they want to be in 10, 20, or 50 years.
- **Action**: Constantly evaluate whether your current actions align with your long-term vision. Think about legacy, not just profit.

### **3. Adopt an Abundance Mindset**

- **Principle**: Billionaires believe resources are limitless when approached creatively. They see opportunities where others see limitations.
- **Action**: Challenge scarcity thinking by rephrasing obstacles: *“How can I make this happen?”* Instead of focusing on what you lack, focus on what you can create.

- **Principle**: Billionaires take risks, but they’re strategic and calculated, weighing potential downsides while focusing on the upside.
