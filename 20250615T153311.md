**Sharper phrasing of your ask:** _"Disambiguate every organisational 'unit' already named, add logically adjacent layers where the lattice shows gaps, and present a coherent, rational catalogue."_

## Exhaustive Unit Catalogue

| Unit Code | Category | Mandate & Scope | Typical Scale | Time Alignment | Authority / Accountability Vector | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **CE** (Cell) | Execution | Atomic work group shipping a single Sprint backlog. | 3--5 FTE | Pulse → Sprint | Cell Lead (A), Mission Cmdr (I) | 
| **SQ** (Squad) | Execution | Two co-located Cells sharing tooling or code-base; optional, used in engineering-heavy domains. | 6--10 FTE | Sprint | Squad Lead (A), Mission Cmdr (C) | 
| **MS**(Mission) | Execution | Cross-functional package delivering a Mission Order objective. | 2--4 Cells / Squads | 6--12 weeks | Mission Commander (A), Program Dir (C) | 
| **TF** (Task-Force) | Execution | Ad-hoc, high-urgency swarm cutting across Missions to extinguish a critical risk or seize a fleeting opportunity; dissolves when objective met. | Variable | ≤ 4 weeks | Task-Force Lead (A), Program Dir (I) | 
| **PRJ**(Project) | Scope / Finance | Contractual envelope of scope, budget, and stakeholders; may consume ≥ 1 Missions. | Budget-defined | Mission → Program | Project Owner (A), Program Dir (C) | 
| **PGM**(Program) | Coordination | Thematic cluster of Projects optimising resources and learning. | 2--4 Projects | 26 weeks | Program Director (A), Campaign Sponsor (C) | 
| **CMP**(Campaign) | Strategic Execution | Cohesive strategic thrust (market entry, platform overhaul). Holds capital envelope. | ≥ 1 Programs | 52 weeks | Campaign Sponsor (A), SO Chief (C) | 
| **PF**(Portfolio) | Capital Governance | Aggregate of Campaigns inside one strategic domain; balances risk/return. | Company scale | Season | Strategic Council (A) | 
| **SD** (Support Division) | Functional Service | Provide enabling capabilities (IT, HR, Finance, Legal, etc.) via SLAs. | Discipline-defined | Continuous | SD Lead (A), SO Logistics (C) | 
| **IH**(Intelligence Hub) | Intelligence | Ingest internal metrics + external intel; produce decision-ready briefs. | ≤ 15 analysts | Continuous | IH Director (A), SO Chief (C) | 
| **SO**(Strategic Operations) | Staff | Translate Council intent; craft doctrine; design Campaigns; own logistics doctrine. | Core staff ≤ 30 | Continuous | SO Chief (A), Council (C) | 
| **SCX**(Strategic Council) | Governance | Set vision, allocate capital ceilings, ratify doctrine versions. | 7--9 domain heads | Season | Council Chair (A), Board/Owners (I) | 
| **FO** (Field Officer) | Overlay | Embedded servant-leader: unblock, coach, enforce cadence integrity, conduit to SO + SD. | 1 per Mission | Pulse | FO (A for cadence), Mission Cmdr (R for output) | 

_(A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed; "R" noted for context.)_

### Notes on Adjacent & Rational Additions

1. **Squad (SQ)** -- optional meso-layer where two Cells must share code or design libraries; avoids over-loading Mission Commander with granular supervision.

2. **Task-Force (TF)** -- provides shock-troop capability without bloating Mission charters; disbands fast, preventing org cruft.

3. **Portfolio (PF)** -- explicit capital--risk balancing bucket, missing in many agile-only schemes; prerequisite for mature capital governance.

### Relationship Grid (simplified)
    
    
    Strategic Council  →  Strategic Operations  →  Campaign (CMP)
                                             ↘
                            Intelligence Hub   Program (PGM) ↔ Support Divisions
                                                      ↘
                                             Project (PRJ)
                                                      ↘
                             Field Officer → Mission (MS) ← Task-Force (TF)
                                                      ↘
                                      Squad (SQ) -- Cell (CE)
    

- **Vertical**: policy → doctrine → capital → execution.
- **Horizontal**: SD and IH service all vertical layers; FO overlays Mission zone.

This table now clarifies every structural building block, fills adjacency gaps (Squad, Task-Force, Portfolio), and positions each unit in the authority lattice without prescribing new behaviour--strictly descriptive, as requested.
