To make the system sovereign, credible, and high-functioning, you need to draw a **hard, visible line** between the **Factory (public-good, sourcing engine)** and the **Studio (private, venture builder and equity holder)**. The power comes not from blending them--but from interfacing them with precision.
* * *

## I. **Essential Distinction**

|  | **Startup Factory** | **Venture Studio (Eupator)** | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Legal Form** | gGmbH (non-profit) | UG or GmbH (for-profit) | 
| **Ownership** | Universities, corporates, city | You (majority founder) | 
| **Funding Sources** | Grants (BMWK EXIST Factory), in-kind from unis, city budget | Private capital (angels, micro-fund), startup equity | 
| **Mission** | Validate academic/tech ideas, match talent, create fundable spinouts | Build, capitalise, and scale high-quality startups | 
| **Value Created** | Dealflow, validated teams, MVPs, early IP rights | Equity, returns, operational speed, company creation | 
| **Brand Identity** | Institutional, neutral, civic | Aggressive, founder-centric, venture-grade | 
* * *

## II. **Operational Logic**

### **Startup Factory**

**Focus:**

- Pre-startup phase
- Academic scouting, team formation, MVP validation
- Public grant compliance and transparency
- Neutral public legitimacy

**Mechanics:**

- Runs 2--3 validation sprints/year
- Assigns staff "venture architects" to support early teams
- Owns no equity, takes no IP
- Produces spin-out-ready opportunities
- Has a governance structure universities + corporates can sign off on
* * *

### **Venture Studio (Eupator)**

**Focus:**

- Post-validation startup phase
- Build ventures at speed with shared ops stack and early capital
- Capture and manage equity
- Fundraising, GTM, hiring, legal structure

**Mechanics:**

- Maintains a "Launch OS" (legal templates, tech stack, brand assets)
- Signs founders, executes MVPs, iterates
- Holds 15--25% startup equity
- Invests via SAFE, convertible or structured IP deal
- Prepares and supports for seed round

## III. **Interface: The Deal Pipeline**

Here's how the two plug into each other:

| Step | What Happens | Factory Role | Studio Role | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **1. Sourcing** | Researcher or student with idea enters Factory intake | Scout & coach them | Not involved yet | 
| **2. Validation** | 6-week structured sprint: team formed, MVP built | Runs program, provides mentors, pays prototyping budget | May observe only | 
| **3. Decision Point** | Project is marked "spin-out ready" by IP committee | Formalises IP licence template, documents valuation basis | Receives notification, triggers option review | 
| **4. Studio Option** | Studio has 60 days to exercise exclusive build right | Waits for decision | If interested, exercises option and incorporates startup | 
| **5. Build Phase** | Startup is formally spun out, founders join studio environment | Hands off; tracks metrics | Owns 15--25%, supports team full-time, prepares for funding | 
| **6. Reporting** | Both entities report to funders and partners | Grant reporting, institutional KPIs | Portfolio reporting, investor updates | 
* * *

## IV. **What Keeps the Boundary Clean**

| Category | Boundary Mechanism | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Equity** | Factory takes none; Studio takes 15--25% | 
| **Capital** | Factory uses public & institutional capital; Studio uses private & angel capital | 
| **IP Rights** | Factory holds IP until studio activates the licence via option; licences are royalty-free until Series A | 
| **Staffing** | Staff are either Factory (grant-funded) or Studio (equity/investor funded), never shared without formal SLA | 
| **Decision-making** | Factory governed by multi-stakeholder board; Studio is founder-led with internal strategic council | 
| **Brand** | Factory uses civic-academic visual ID; Studio uses venture-driven design language (never merged in comms) | 
* * *

## V. **Why This Works Strategically**

**1. Universities**  
→ Get a clean, non-profit vehicle they can legally support.  
→ No commercial entanglement or exposure.  
→ They increase spin-out rates with no equity or legal risk.

**2. City & Ministry**  
→ Can pour grants into the Factory with traceability.  
→ Factory contributes to regional KPIs (jobs, IP transfer, innovation density).

**3. Studio (You)**  
→ Secure proprietary dealflow, 1st pick of high-quality spinouts.  
→ Keep public legitimacy through proximity to trusted institutions.  
→ Own equity, drive speed, deploy capital.

## VII. Critical Execution Rule

**Never blur the two.**  
You are sovereign _because_ you control both--_not because they are the same thing_. The moment you confuse this distinction (legally, financially, or perceptually), you break grant compliance, lose legitimacy, and invite scrutiny.

Let me know if you want:

- Option contract template (Factory → Studio)
- Standardised spin-out checklist
- Interface agreement (Studio × Factory)
- Naming + visual identity to anchor this split in all decks and touchpoints
