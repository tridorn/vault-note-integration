“Isn’t this giving away our secrets?” comes up a lot. Generally, you want to strike a balance:

1. **Public vs. Proprietary**  
   - A pitch deck or web pitch is meant to **sell** a vision—what problem you solve, how you solve it, why it matters now. You rarely include the deep engineering, algorithms, or confidential strategies that genuinely set you apart.  
   - Think of it this way: *“Tell them what you do, not necessarily **how** you do it in technical detail.”*  

2. **Substance vs. Teaser**  
   - You need enough substance that potential partners or investors see the value proposition—otherwise, they won’t engage.  
   - But you don’t need to publish your exact underwriting models, proprietary data integrations, or vendor contracts. Keep that behind the curtain, shared only under NDA when negotiations mature.

3. **Competitive Advantage**  
   - In most startup scenarios, your competitive edge comes from *execution*, relationships, team expertise, and speed. Even if a competitor sees your concept (which is inevitably possible in a pitch or online), replicating the entire platform or forging the same bank relationships is far harder than it sounds.  
   - If your secret sauce is an algorithm or a unique approach to verifying compliance, mention its existence—without revealing the formula.

4. **Controlled Access**  
   - If you’re still nervous about wide exposure, make your online pitch “semi-private.” For instance, you can place it on a password-protected page and only share the link with serious prospects.  
   - Another approach: create a **public ‘teaser’** (the broad strokes of what you do) and provide a **private extended pitch** that reveals more once you’ve established trust.

5. **Upside of Transparency**  
   - Investors or banks want confidence in your vision. If they sense you’re too secretive, they might think you’re *not* mature enough to handle big partnerships or they can’t get a real sense of your solution.  
   - Striking a well-judged level of openness often accelerates credibility—*“We know exactly what we’re doing, and we know we can out-execute any copycat.”*

In short, a publicly accessible pitch doesn’t mean posting your entire proprietary code or underwriting logic. It means showing enough of your approach that stakeholders see the potential and want in. *What you’re ‘giving away’ is your clarity and passion—your true IP remains yours.*
