**Correction:** Your question, _"How much is this Putin's war, over Russia's, really?"_ should be reframed more precisely as:  
**"To what extent is the war in Ukraine a personal project of Vladimir Putin rather than a reflection of enduring structural interests of the Russian state?"**

* * *

### Strategic Attribution: **Putin vs. Russian State**

The correct analytical frame is not binary (personal vs. national), but layered:  
To what degree is this war an expression of Putin's **idiosyncratic vision**, and to what extent does it align with **systemic imperatives** of the Russian power apparatus?

#### I. **Initiation: Largely Putin's War**

The decision to launch a full-scale invasion in February 2022 was:

- Made in extreme secrecy
- Driven by a narrow circle (Putin, Patrushev, Shoigu, Gerasimov)
- Based on **deeply flawed intelligence** (on Ukrainian collapse, Western inaction)
- Overriding more cautious voices within the state apparatus

**This was not the product of institutional consensus.**  
It reflected:

- Putin's unique fusion of **historical revisionism**, **personal legacy fixation**, and **KGB-paranoia about Western subversion**
- A **high-risk gamble** to lock in regime security, via external shock

**Conclusion**: The _initiation_ of the war was **discretionary and personal**, not structurally inevitable.

* * *

#### II. **Sustainment: Now Co-owned by the Russian System**

Once the war began and initial objectives failed, the Russian state **adapted** around the conflict. The regime's survival, the elite's economic interests, and the state's coercive apparatus have now become **structurally invested in continuation**.

Key shifts:

- **Defense-industrial mobilisation**: Entire sectors of the economy are now war-dependent.
- **Elite Buy-in**: The war provides contracts, assets, and a framework for resource reallocation under state control.
- **Institutional Alignment**: Bureaucracies (FSB, MoD, propaganda apparatus) have all shifted to wartime footing.

**The war is no longer just Putin's project--it has become a pillar of regime continuity.**  
Exit would now require dismantling the very mechanisms that preserve the system's internal stability.

* * *

#### III. **Public Sentiment: Passive, Not Enthusiastic**

Contrary to myth, this is not a popular war. Russian society is not mobilised in a nationalist fervor. The regime has:

- Avoided total mobilisation until it became unavoidable
- Framed the war as defensive, not imperial
- Suppressed dissent through coercion, not persuasion

Polls show **resigned acceptance**, not active support. There's no mass pressure to escalate, but also no resistance strong enough to stop it.

### Strategic Attribution Summary

| Dimension | Degree of Putin Influence | Degree of Structural Convergence | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| War initiation | Very High (Personalised) | Low (Top-down decision) | 
| War justification | High (Ideological narrative) | Medium (State propaganda aligned) | 
| War sustainment | Medium (Now dispersed) | High (Systemic entrenchment) | 
| Political reversibility | Low (Exit = collapse risk) | Very Low (Now existential) | 

* * *

### Final Assessment

The _launch_ of the war was Putin's.  
The _continuation_ of the war is now Russia's--**not because the Russian state intrinsically needed this war, but because its power system has reorganised itself around it**.

At this point, Russia _as a state_ is structurally unable to end the war without destabilising its own regime architecture. That is the real strategic lock-in.
