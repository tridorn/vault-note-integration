Below is a **first‑principles "meta‑scaffold"**--a _recipe_ that lets you derive **any** folder / label / bucket structure (notes 📓, email 📧, cloud files 🗄, photos 📷 …) while keeping them _siblings in a single mental universe_.  
Think of it as a **grammar**: give it a medium and it produces a consistent, predictable set of containers.

* * *

## 1 Foundational Concepts (non‑negotiable)

| Concept | Why it matters | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Axes, not trees** | Every storage scheme is the cartesian product of a _very small_ set of independent axes (≤ 3). | 
| **Canonical axis names** | Reuse the same axis vocabulary everywhere; only the _values_ differ per medium. | 
| **Decile prefixing** | Two‑digit numbers (`00_`, `10_`) guarantee sort order and leave gaps for future inserts. | 
| **Lifecycle supersedes medium** | Capture → Commit → Work → Deliver → Archive stays identical whether the payload is an email, a design file, or a calendar event. | 
| **Append‑only change log** | If an axis or value changes meaning, you _add_ a new decile--never rename an old one. | 
| **Schema marker** | A single text file (`SCHEMA.md`) at root describes the axis set and version; each medium keeps its own copy. | 
* * *

## 2 The Three Canonical Axes (CCL)

1. **C = Content‑Type**  
_What is it intrinsically?_ Examples: `note`, `email`, `file`, `image`, `meeting`.

2. **C = Context**  
_Where or whom does it belong to?_ Examples: `client_A`, `home_finances`, `public_blog`.

3. **L = Lifecycle**  
_What is happening to it?_ Values are universal: `10_Capture`, `20_Triage`, `30_Nurture`, `40_Plan`, `50_Build`, `60_Ship`, `70_Reflect`, `80_Library`, `90_Archive`.

> **Rule #1:** You **never invent more axes**.  
If you feel a need, it's actually a value of `Context` or `Content‑Type`.

* * *

## 3 Folder‑Generation Algorithm

> For _any_ medium, run these three steps:

1. **Pick the primary axis** that the medium's UI renders best.  
_Email clients_ show top‑level folders well → choose **Context** as top.  
_Obsidian vault_ shows flat root → choose **Lifecycle** as top.  
_Cloud drive_ often mirrors projects → choose **Context** on top, **Lifecycle** second.

2. **Decide depth = 2 or 3.**  
_If UI gives you only one visible level_ (Gmail labels) → combine axes in the label name (`20_Triage/Finance_Email`).  
_If UI supports nested_ folders → separate axes into nested layers.

3. **Generate containers**:
    
        <primary_axis_decile>_<value>/<secondary_axis_decile>_<value>/… 
    

All unused deciles remain empty--future‑proof expansion slots.

* * *

### 3.1 Example A -- Obsidian Notes (Lifecycle‑First)
    
    
    10_Capture/
    20_Triage/
    30_Nurture/
    40_Plan/
    50_Build/
    60_Ship/
    70_Reflect/
    80_Library/
    90_Archive/
    ── projects/               ← Context axis lives INSIDE lifecycle if needed
    

### 3.2 Example B -- Email (Context‑First)
    
    
    00_Admin/
    10_Client_A/
       ├─ 20_Triage/
       ├─ 50_Build/
       └─ 60_Ship/
    20_Client_B/
    ...
    90_Personal/
    

Email rule: **same decile means same lifecycle**, even across contexts.  
Search filters can now do `label:*/20_Triage`.

### 3.3 Example C -- Cloud Share (Context → Lifecycle → Content‑Type)
    
    
    10_Project_X/
       ├─ 50_Build/
       │   ├─ img/
       │   ├─ docs/
       │   └─ src/
       └─ 60_Ship/
            ├─ pdf/
            └─ zip/
    

Here _Content‑Type_ becomes a **suffix sub‑folder** (`img/`, `pdf/`).

## 4 Naming Conventions (deciles = language of movement)

| Decile | Lifecycle value | Mnemonic | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `10_` | Capture | inbox | 
| `20_` | Triage | decide | 
| `30_` | Nurture | incubate | 
| `40_` | Plan | commit | 
| `50_` | Build | work | 
| `60_` | Ship | done | 
| `70_` | Reflect | learn | 
| `80_` | Library | evergreen | 
| `90_` | Archive | cold | 

> **Rule #2:** Moving an item _between deciles_ is the only legal way to change lifecycle.
* * *

## 5 The Schema Marker

Every top‑level container (vault root, email top label, shared drive root) stores a **`SCHEMA.md`** file:
    
    
    # CCL Schema v1.0  (2025‑07‑25)
    
    Axes:
    1. Content‑Type  (intrinsic: note, email, file, image …)
    2. Context       (project, department, personal, public …)
    3. Lifecycle     (10_ … 90_)
    Rules:
    - Decile numbers reserved forever.
    - New contexts get next free decile in 10‑blocks (00_, 10_, 20_ …).
    - If lifecycles ever split (e.g., QA added), allocate 55_ QA.
    
    Change log:
    - v1.0  Initial definition.
    

Automation scripts read this file to enforce moves and generate new scaffolds.

## 6 Automation & Interchangeability

- **Programmatic path mapping**:
    
        def path(content, context, lifecycle):
        return f"{context}/{lifecycle}"
    

Same function works for IMAP label names or OneDrive paths.

- **Cross‑medium dashboards**:  
Because deciles align, you can say "Show me _all 20_Triage items across email, notes, drive_."

- **Migration**: rename only the _value_ part, never the decile prefix → links stay valid.
* * *

## 7 Edge‑Case Playbook

| Situation | What to do | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Need a **QA** stage between Build & Ship | Allocate `55_QA/` across all media. | 
| Personal side project | Assign new Context decile `30_Side_Projects/`; inside, keep lifecycle folders. | 
| Mixed media in same tool (e.g., Google Drive) | Use **Content‑Type** suffix folders at the _third_ depth (docs, img, src, etc.). | 
* * *

## 8 Why This Works

1. **One brain‑load**: Memorise nine lifecycle deciles once; reuse forever.

2. **Axes are orthogonal**: Adding a new client or a new stage never breaks other axes.

3. **Deciles are future‑proof**: Always ten empty slots before you touch existing names.

4. **Schema portability**: Copy `SCHEMA.md` into any new medium → generator script scaffolds the directories automatically.

* * *

### TL;DR

_Adopt the **CCL framework**:_

1. **Content‑Type** (what),

2. **Context** (where/whose),

3. **Lifecycle** (when in flow).

Give each lifecycle value a fixed **decile prefix** (`10_` … `90_`).  
For any new medium--notes, email, cloud drive--choose which axis goes top‑level, generate folders by cartesian product, record the rules in `SCHEMA.md`, and enjoy instant mental interoperability.
