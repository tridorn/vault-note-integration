**Refined Request:**

> *“Dissect each operational flow in precise, granular terms—enumerating steps, actor actions, decision points, and data exchanges. I seek total clarity.”*

---

## DETAILED FLOW DECONSTRUCTION – **Green Loan Enablement for SMEs**

Each flow is treated as a protocol: actors, intent, sequence, and interface. The level of detail here assumes you are **building operational scaffolding** and **not coding yet**, hence the emphasis on process fidelity and information integrity.

---

### **Flow 0: Actor Onboarding & Credentialing**  
**Objective:** Ensure all parties can be identified, trusted, and integrated.

| Step | Actor | Action | Data / Artifact |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 0.1 | SME | Registers via intake form | Company data, UBOs, last 2 years financials |
| 0.2 | Vendor | Registers product categories & commercial terms | Product catalogue, certifications |
| 0.3 | Platform | Conducts KYB/AML via third-party (e.g., IDnow, ComplyAdvantage) | Verifiable identity report |
| 0.4 | Platform | Issues digital credential (e.g., signed JSON Web Token) | Auth token, risk category |
| 0.5 | Bank | Provides API access terms or data drop-points | Bank’s data intake spec |

> 🔒 **Trust Check:** Verify all actors meet minimal legal, risk, and ESG criteria. Encode into a permissions model.

---

### **Flow 1: Opportunity Origination (Vendor-Led)**  
**Objective:** Trigger a potential financing event via vendor sales motion.

| Step | Actor | Action | Data / Artifact |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 1.1 | Vendor | Quotes SME for green CapEx | SKU, cost, carbon delta estimate |
| 1.2 | SME | Accepts quote conditionally, opts for financing | Consent to share financial data |
| 1.3 | Platform | Logs request, parses quote metadata | Financing ticket opened |
| 1.4 | Platform | Sends data request to SME | Bank statements, tax filings, CRM exports |
| 1.5 | SME | Uploads / syncs financial data | XBRL or CSV financials |

> 📎 **Decision Gate:** Opportunity is now *financeable*. Kick off verification.

---

### **Flow 2: Data Verification (Green & Credit)**  
**Objective:** Validate the project is green, and the SME is fundable.

| Step | Actor | Action | Data / Artifact |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 2.1 | Platform | Calls external verifier API (e.g., TÜV, CDP) | Certify product compliance (EU taxonomy, etc.) |
| 2.2 | Verifier | Issues digital attestation (signed payload) | Green audit hash |
| 2.3 | Platform | Runs credit model (in-house or bank-provided) | Score, PD/LGD bands |
| 2.4 | Platform | Flags discrepancies / requests human override | Analyst workflow triggered (if required) |

> ✅ **Verification Outcome:** Loan dossier deemed credible for submission.

---

### **Flow 3: Loan Packaging & Submission**  
**Objective:** Assemble and transmit a machine-readable credit request to bank.

| Step | Actor | Action | Data / Artifact |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 3.1 | Platform | Generates loan dossier | Quote, SME financials, green audit, repayment model |
| 3.2 | Platform | Compresses dossier into signed package | JSON + digest hash + timestamp |
| 3.3 | Platform | Transmits to bank via SFTP/API/email (as per agreement) | Submission log |
| 3.4 | Bank | Acknowledges receipt | Submission ID, SLA trigger |

> 📎 **Data Architecture Note:** Treat dossier as composable—modular blocks, interchangeable per institution.

---

### **Flow 4: Credit Decision & Term-Setting**  
**Objective:** Receive term sheet, secure SME acceptance.

| Step | Actor | Action | Data / Artifact |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 4.1 | Bank | Issues term sheet or rejection | PDF or JSON term document |
| 4.2 | Platform | Normalises and displays offer | Loan amount, rate, duration, conditions |
| 4.3 | SME | Reviews and accepts (digitally) | E-signature, IP logging |
| 4.4 | Platform | Notifies bank and vendor | Accepted deal snapshot |

> 🔒 **Legal Check:** Embed irrevocable consent and waiver clauses into SME interface.

---

### **Flow 5: Disbursement & Vendor Settlement**  
**Objective:** Bank funds the deal; vendor delivers product/service.

| Step | Actor | Action | Data / Artifact |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 5.1 | Bank | Sends funds to escrow or direct to vendor | SWIFT confirmation |
| 5.2 | Platform | Triggers fund release logic | Matching logic: conditions met? |
| 5.3 | Vendor | Confirms delivery schedule | Installation date |
| 5.4 | Platform | Tracks progress | Escrow timer, milestone tracking |

> ⚙️ **Optional Smart Logic:** Conditional disbursement only after 3rd party confirmation or milestone verified.

---

### **Flow 6: Implementation Verification**  
**Objective:** Prove delivery / installation has occurred.

| Step | Actor | Action | Data / Artifact |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 6.1 | Vendor | Uploads photos, delivery confirmation | Geo-tagged metadata |
| 6.2 | Platform | Compares with quote / schedule | Project verification model |
| 6.3 | Inspector | (if required) validates install | Inspection report |
| 6.4 | Platform | Finalises project status | "Deployed" state token |

> 📎 **Trust Artifact:** Time-locked install proof; key for unlocking reporting / subsidies.

---

### **Flow 7: Impact Monitoring & Reporting**  
**Objective:** Generate ESG impact reports for banks / regulators.

| Step | Actor | Action | Data / Artifact |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 7.1 | SME | Shares utility bills / sensor data (auto or manual) | CO2 reduction, cost savings |
| 7.2 | Platform | Aggregates over time | Monthly impact report |
| 7.3 | Platform | Sends report to bank / regulator | EU Taxonomy aligned format |
| 7.4 | Bank | Logs in ESG compliance systems | Reporting receipt token |

> 🧠 **Scalability Heuristic:** Design reports once, map to both institutional and regulatory schemas.

---

### **Flow 8: Servicing & Exception Handling**  
**Objective:** Ensure repayment, handle delinquencies, manage exceptions.

| Step | Actor | Action | Data / Artifact |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 8.1 | Bank | Starts repayment cycle | Direct debit or collection |
| 8.2 | Platform | Monitors payment signals | On-time, delayed, default |
| 8.3 | SME | Requests restructuring (if applicable) | Extension request form |
| 8.4 | Platform | Facilitates exception workflow | Ticket → Manual → Approval |
| 8.5 | Bank | Adjusts terms or escalates | Modified contract, write-off, etc. |

> 📌 **Extension:** Plug-in insurance, guarantees, or blended-finance layers here.

---

## Optional: Flow Dependency Chart (Summarised)

```
0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8  
(Onboarding → Origination → Validation → Submission → Disbursement → Delivery → Monitoring → Servicing)
```

Each flow builds *proof*—of identity, of creditworthiness, of delivery, of impact. Tech must encode these proofs, not just orchestrate screens.
