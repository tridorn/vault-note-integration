Yes, **Sierra Chart has a cost**, but it's relatively low compared to the value it provides for serious futures trading. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Sierra Chart Pricing**
Sierra Chart offers different packages, but for **futures trading with AMP Futures**, you will most likely need **Package 5** or higher.

| **Package** | **Cost (Per Month)** | **Key Features** |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Package 5 (Advanced)** | **$36** | TPO Profile Charts, Volume Profile, Footprint Charts, DOM, Depth of Market, Advanced Order Flow Tools |
| **Package 11 (w/ Denali Data Feed)** | **$46** | All of the above, plus Sierra's own low-latency data feed (Denali) |

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Feed Costs**
To execute trades, you need **market data**. Your choices:
1. **CQG Data Feed** (offered via AMP Futures)
   - **Costs**: ~$3-$15/month depending on which futures exchanges you subscribe to (CME, NYMEX, etc.).
   - **Pros**: Works fine for Sierra Chart execution.
   - **Cons**: No historical tick data (but fine for day trading).

2. **Rithmic Data Feed** (offered via AMP Futures)
   - **Costs**: ~$10-$20/month depending on exchanges.
   - **Pros**: Lower latency, more precise order book data.
   - **Cons**: More expensive than CQG.

3. **Sierra Chart Denali Data Feed** (only works with Sierra)
   - **Costs**: **$10 + CME Exchange Fees ($3.50-$15/month depending on the package)**.
   - **Pros**: Best for **historical data, depth of market (DOM), and order flow analysis**.
   - **Cons**: Doesn't work with other platforms.

üöÄ **Recommendation for Your Case**:
- Use **Sierra Chart Package 5 ($36/month)**.
- Choose **CQG ($3-$15/month) or Rithmic ($10-$20/month) as your data feed**.
- If you want **better historical depth**, consider **Sierra‚Äôs Denali feed ($10 + CME exchange fee).**

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Total Estimated Costs**
| **Item** | **Estimated Cost (Per Month)** |
|----------|------------------|
| **Sierra Chart Package 5** | $36 |
| **CQG or Rithmic Data Feed** | $5-$20 |
| **CME Market Data (if needed)** | $3.50-$15 |
| **Total Estimated Cost** | **$40 - $60/month** |

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Can You Get Sierra Chart for Free?**
Yes! **AMP Futures offers a limited version of Sierra Chart for free**, but:
- It lacks **full DOM, footprint charts, and advanced order flow tools**.
- It's **not ideal for serious futures trading**.
- **You still need to pay for market data**.

**Conclusion:** If you want to take futures trading seriously, **paying $40-$60/month for Sierra Chart + a good data feed is worth it**. It‚Äôs one of the best setups for low-latency execution and market depth analysis.
