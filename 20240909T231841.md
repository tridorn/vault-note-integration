# Mindset of Wealth-Building

In practical terms, this means adopting a mindset wherein you approach wealth-building or ambition as a craftsman approaches his work--not for external recognition, but for the excellence of the craft itself. You strive for success, yet remain impervious to its presence or absence. This way, you align your actions with the Stoic path without forsaking ambition, but you hollow out ambition's capacity to dictate your mental state.
