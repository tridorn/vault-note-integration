Correction: "Rebuild the concept entirely from foundational principles--design a complete slide communication system, defining not just the visual logic but the ideological function, intent, audience reach mechanism, and conceptual layers of slides as a medium."

--

You want not a design system. You want a **communication weapon** with internal theory, tactical protocol, and operational form. Not a presentation format--**a worldview delivery apparatus**.

This is that system:

* * *

# SYSTEM NAME: **VECT**

**Definition**: _Visual Executive Cognitive Transmission_

> VECT is not for showcasing information. It is for implanting judgment, transmitting frames, and compressing strategic conviction into weaponised visual units.

* * *

## I. SYSTEM PURPOSE

**Primary Intent**:  
To operationalise slide decks as a **medium of elite transmission**--condensed reasoning, strategic directives, and worldview assertions--deployable in zero-friction environments (asynchronous, high-context, power-dense).

**Positioning**:  
Not storytelling. Not information. **Precision judgment objects**.

**Measure of Success**:  
A deck succeeded if the viewer _repeats your framing_ unprompted, not if they "understood" it.

* * *

## II. VECT THEORY: FUNCTIONAL RECONCEPTION OF SLIDES

Traditional slide thinking is wrong. Slides are not "support." They are **autonomous ideological machines**. Each slide is a layered transmission node.

### Slide = 5-Layer Cognitive Construct:

| Layer | Role | Operational Description | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **1. Intent Layer** | What it's _meant to do_ | Drive a shift: belief, orientation, decision | 
| **2. Frame Layer** | How it _re-contextualises_ | Changes how reality is structured (e.g., redefines risk as inevitability) | 
| **3. Payload Layer** | What it _contains_ | Visualised logic: data, delta, claim | 
| **4. Rhythm Layer** | Where it sits _in sequence_ | Controls narrative tempo, tension, pause, escalation | 
| **5. Signature Layer** | How it _feels_ | Enforces authorship, psychological aesthetic, recognisability | 

Every slide in VECT must be explicitly constructed through all five layers.

* * *

## III. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### A. NARRATIVE UNITS = "OPERATIVE CHAINS"

Decks are not sequences. They are **Operative Chains**--causal logic links built from Slide Units.

Each chain has:

- **Command Slide** (sets direction)
- **Delta Slide** (shows change)
- **Force Slide** (shows mechanism)
- **Break Slide** (disorients / resets perception)
- **Call Slide** (demands irreversible action)

Chains can stand alone or nest. Each chain must either:

- Close a loop (conclude an argument), or
- Open a conflict (initiate tension)

Decks are built from these. No fluff slides. No filler transitions.

* * *

### B. SLIDE TYPES: VECT MODULES

| Code | Name | Function | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| CMD | **Command Slide** | Directive-level assertion (not intro) | 
| DLT | **Delta Slide** | Visualised before/after | 
| FRC | **Force Slide** | Shows causality--"this leads to this" | 
| XPT | **Export Slide** | Frames internal logic for external use | 
| OBJ | **Objection Slide** | Pre-emptive conflict resolution | 
| BRK | **Break Slide** | Dramatic pause or inversion | 
| CLX | **Call Slide** | Demands irreversible act or judgment | 

Each has fixed roles and formatting. _You don't improvise slide types. You deploy slide classes._

* * *

## IV. VISUAL + INTERACTION RULESET

### A. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**Slides are visual command-line interfaces**. They exist to:

- Encode thought-objects
- Trigger directional cognition
- Imply authority through structure, not tone

**No metaphors. No gradients. No soft UI.**

### B. FORMAT DEFINITIONS

| Element | Rule | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Aspect Ratio | 3:2 horizontal, fixed--resembles a page, not a screen | 
| Colour | Light grey canvas, black text, one accent (custom) | 
| Fonts | One grotesk sans (e.g., Untitled Sans), one mono (e.g., JetBrains Mono) | 
| Charts | Block-based only. No lines, no circles. Geometry > precision | 
| Layout | 2-band vertical: Frame Rail (left), Payload Zone (right) | 
| Motion | Banned. Only "cut" transitions. You build tempo with rhythm, not fade | 

Each visual decision serves clarity, not expression. There is no decoration.

* * *

## V. LANGUAGE SYSTEM

### A. LEXICON CONTROL

You do not speak in generalities. You deploy a **fixed rhetorical regime**.

| Element | Description | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Slide Title | Always a command or verdict (never a question) | 
| Body | Short-form assertion only (≤20 words) | 
| Emphasis | Done via structure (position/scale), not style (bold, italics) | 
| Captions | Used for precision, not decoration; tie directly to the data | 
| Glyphs | Optional language augmenters: e.g., → = logic, ≠ = conflict, ↯ = rupture | 

You write slides like you write commands: unambiguous, irreversible, deniable if needed.

* * *

## VI. DELIVERY LOGIC

### A. AUDIENCE MODES

| Mode | Objective | Design Adaptation | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Asynchronous Executive** | Transfer conviction + frame outcome | High-density, low-narration, total readability | 
| **Tactical Room** | Trigger group decision | Emphasise tempo, rhythm, and objection isolation | 
| **Mass Broadcast** | Replicate framing | Focus on clarity of delta, viral legibility, less modularity | 

Each deck must declare its _mode_ on Slide 1.

* * *

### B. DEPLOYMENT TYPES

| Type | Format | Use | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Live Deck** | PDF or HTML, presented | 1:1 or small rooms | 
| **Drop Deck** | PDF only, async read | No narration required | 
| **Chain Set** | Modular slide packets | Distributed narrative components | 
| **Battle Deck** | Built for direct conflict, contains objections + counterlogic embedded | Internal conflict resolution or competition framing | 
* * *

## VII. SYSTEM CONTROL

### A. VERSIONING

- Every slide gets a version tag (e.g., `DLT-2.3.1`) in metadata
- Edits logged in master changelog slide (CLX-last)

### B. AUDIT

- Each deck undergoes _Function Audit_: each slide checked for 5-layer validity
- _Objection Audit_ ensures opponent POV is neutralised before viewer can raise it

### C. Propagation Chain

- Release → Derivative → Feedback → Modify
- You do not "finish" a deck. You field-test and evolve it like a product.
* * *

## FINAL

**VECT is not a slide system.** It is a _tactical cognitive framework_. It encodes:
- Thought tempo
- Frame discipline
- Visual and rhetorical control
- Repeatable precision under pressure

It does not serve attention. It _imposes direction_.

Let me know if you want a full execution environment for VECT (templates, glyphs, documentation, linter).
