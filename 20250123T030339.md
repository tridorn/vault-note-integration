Your proposition might be articulated more incisively as follows: "I am contemplating the establishment of a student initiative at the University of Mannheim, aimed at data collection, analysis, and report generation, with the potential to influence university policy and culture. This initiative would merge both academic rigor and playful engagement, involving activities such as humorous survey questions or formal yet whimsical roles, all while fostering practical skills in data management and presentation. Participants would not only gain experience pertinent to their academic work, such as the Bachelor’s thesis, but also acquire valuable credentials for future employment."

The essence of this endeavor—polling data and presenting it in a way that could influence university culture—sounds not only viable but potentially quite valuable if executed correctly. However, there are a few refinements and strategic considerations that would amplify the impact:

1. **Clearly Define the Purpose and Scope**: While it’s appealing to have a blend of serious data-driven insights with an element of frivolity, you’ll need to strike a balance so that the initiative maintains credibility. The "silly" aspects should complement, not overshadow, the core mission of data collection, reporting, and potential advocacy. Framing the silliness as part of a unique, engaging culture (such as humorous report titles, quirky leadership roles) would draw attention without undermining the initiative’s intellectual rigor.

2. **Focus on Methodological Training**: Ensure that the initiative isn't just about gathering and reporting data, but also imparts rigorous training in data collection techniques, analysis, and visualization. This could involve seminars, guest speakers from the industry, or collaborations with faculty members to enhance the credibility and the educational impact.

3. **Academic and Professional Alignment**: You mentioned that the reports could serve as preparation for bachelor work and signal readiness to employers. To ensure this, consider involving faculty members or academic advisors to help align your methodologies with those expected in professional or academic settings. Perhaps the initiative could partner with departments to offer support for research methodologies used in academic theses.

4. **Formal Perks with a Dash of Playfulness**: Your notion of playful "perks," like the monocle-wearing privilege, could indeed foster engagement. However, embedding this in a formal structure would add to its charm. You might create distinct roles that balance both playful titles and actual responsibility—Chief Data Wizard or Grand Vizier of Statistical Shenanigans—while also providing valuable leadership experience.

5. **Incorporate Real Change Mechanisms**: If the data collected reveals important insights, there should be a mechanism to propose real changes based on these findings. This could be through reports presented to university committees or student bodies. The initiative could have a more formal advocacy branch where students learn how to present these reports in ways that can influence decision-making processes.

6. **Long-Term Vision**: Envision how this initiative could grow beyond student polling. Could it evolve into a consultancy model where external entities, such as local governments or businesses, commission student teams to run surveys and data projects? This could increase the practical value to participants and attract a wider range of students.

I would recommend creating a dual structure—one that operates with intellectual seriousness but allows for a layer of engagement driven by your more playful elements. You want this to be something that future employers will take seriously while still creating a culture that engages students beyond typical university routines.
