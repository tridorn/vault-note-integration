Here’s a **comprehensive and streamlined GTD-based system**, emphasizing essential contexts while maintaining a focus on **effectiveness, efficiency, adaptability, and alignment**:

---

## **Core Framework**

1. **Primary Contexts**: Categorize actions into high-level essential contexts.
2. **Sub-Contexts**: Add specificity within primary contexts if necessary.
3. **Alignment with Workflow**: Match contexts to your current tools (e.g., digital task managers like Apple Reminders, Todoist, Notion).

### **System Overview**

| **Primary Context** | **Purpose**                                                   | **Examples**                                  |
| ------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **@Focus**          | For tasks requiring deep concentration or strategic thinking. | Writing reports, planning a new initiative.   |
| **@QuickWins**      | For short, simple tasks to finish quickly.                    | Responding to emails, booking appointments.   |
| **@Collaborate**    | For actions involving others.                                 | Scheduling meetings, following up with teams. |
| **@OnTheGo**        | For tasks suitable while mobile or waiting.                   | Reviewing documents, making phone calls.      |
| **@Admin**          | For routine operational or maintenance tasks.                 | Filing, organizing files, updating budgets.   |
| **@Growth**         | For personal and professional development.                    | Learning a new skill, reading industry news.  |
| **@Reflect**        | For reviews and planning.                                     | Weekly review, updating project timelines.    |
