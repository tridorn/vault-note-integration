You should have said:  
**“I see 'LP' mentioned often. I know it’s important for venture capital and buyouts, but I want a precise, stripped-down explanation. What exactly is an LP, what is a GP, how do they relate, and why does it matter for Eupator’s future model?”**

Here’s the **exact definition you need**, in practical terms:

---

# **What is an LP?**

**LP** = **Limited Partner**.

- **Limited Partner** = **an investor** who commits capital into a fund.
- LPs **own a financial stake** in the fund, but **have no control** over the fund’s management.
- LPs **cannot be forced to pay more** than they committed, and **have limited liability**—they can only lose their investment, nothing more.

> *Think of LPs as silent shareholders who fund the machine but don’t drive it.*

---

# **What is a GP?**

**GP** = **General Partner**.

- **General Partner** = **the fund manager** (in your case, *future Eupator Capital S.à r.l.*).
- GPs **make all the investment decisions**: what to buy, when to sell, how to manage companies.
- GPs **carry fiduciary responsibility** toward the LPs (they must act in the LPs’ financial interest).
- GPs **earn fees**:  
   - **Management fee**: 1–2 % of committed capital, annually (pays salaries, rent, ops).  
   - **Performance fee (Carry)**: 10–20 % of profits beyond a "hurdle" (often 8 % IRR).

> *The GP is the commander. The LPs are the capital army.*

# **How does the GP-LP structure work?**

| GP (Eupator) | LPs (Family offices, wealthy individuals) |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Forms the fund | Commit money for 10–12 years |
| Sources & executes deals | Have no say in specific deal decisions |
| Collects 1–2 % fee annually | Get quarterly reports + annual financials |
| Takes 10–20 % of fund profits if successful | Receive 80–90 % of all fund returns |

The legal entity holding the fund is usually structured as a **Limited Partnership** (SCSp in Luxembourg, for example) where:
- GP = management & control, tiny capital stake
- LPs = passive investors, big capital stake

---

# **Why is this structure so important for Eupator?**

Because it allows you to:

- **Raise large amounts of external capital** without giving away control of Eupator Holding AG.  
- **Use LP money to buy bigger companies faster**, while still applying the Corpus method.  
- **Earn fees + carry** to fund your Corpus Stewardship Office without needing venture exits.

In short:  
> **LPs fund the expansion; Eupator keeps the compass.**

# **Key LP-related terms you must know**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Commitment | How much an LP promises to invest over the fund’s life |
| Drawdown / Call | When GP demands part of the commitment to close a deal |
| Distribution | When profits are paid back to LPs |
| Hurdle rate | Minimum IRR the GP must beat before earning carry |
| Carry | GP’s share of profits (after hurdle) |
| GP commit | Money the GP personally invests (often 1–2 % of fund) to show skin-in-the-game |

---

# **Summary**  
- **LP** = Passive capital backer.  
- **GP** = Active manager/operator.  
- **Eupator** = GP.  
- **Family offices** (later) = LPs.  
- You raise an **Evergreen Fund** → LPs fund your acquisitions → Corpus ensures the ventures thrive → Profits flow back to LPs → Carry flows to Eupator.

It’s the next logical piece if you’re preparing to pitch future LPs one day.
