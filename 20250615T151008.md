### IV. **Flows & Interfaces**

_Defines how authority, information, resources, and accountability move across the system. These are the arteries of the organizational architecture. Without formalized flows, structure collapses into informal networks and decision latency._

* * *

#### 4.1 **Planning Flow**

_Council → SO → Mission_

| Stage | Description | Responsible | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Strategic Intent** | Council defines goals, constraints, and doctrine boundaries for the coming Campaign/Season | Strategic Council | 
| **Scenario Planning** | SO models campaign paths, allocates time blocks, and identifies possible Missions | Strategic Operations | 
| **Mission Design** | SO crafts Mission Orders (objective, time window, doctrine rules, resource ceiling) | SO + Program Director | 
| **Mission Briefing** | FO + Mission Lead receive Mission Order and prepare launch | FO + Mission Lead | 

_Rule: Missions cannot self-define scope; all Missions emerge from SO-issued Orders, tied to Campaign intent._

* * *

#### 4.2 **Feedback Flow**

_Mission → FO → SO/IH → Council_

| Origin | Vector | Payload | Frequency | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Mission** | Field Officer | Operational health, blocker alerts, morale signals, milestone status | Pulse & Sprint | 
| **FO** | Strategic Operations | Roll-up of multiple Mission states; trends and weak signals | Weekly | 
| **IH** | Strategic Council | Aggregated dashboards: execution trends, risks, systemic inefficiencies | Monthly | 
| **SO** | Council | Strategic implications, doctrine friction, capacity constraints | Quarterly (Campaign Review) | 

_All feedback is structured, not conversational. No major decisions are taken based on informal reports._

* * *

#### 4.3 **Intel Processing Chain**

_Internal and external knowledge flows converge here._

| Stage | Description | Owner | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Capture** | Raw signals from Missions, markets, support divisions, external sources | IH | 
| **Classification** | Signals tagged, clustered (by relevance, risk, time-sensitivity) | IH | 
| **Synthesis** | Reports generated for SO (strategic), Council (directional), and SDs (operational) | IH | 
| **Distribution** | Structured briefings dispatched by cadence level (Sprint, Campaign, Season) | IH | 

_IH is not a passive storehouse. It is a filtering and forecasting unit. Garbage in, garbage out._

* * *

#### 4.4 **Logistics & Resourcing Flow**

_Missions cannot requisition ad hoc. All material flows follow formal channels._

| Requester | Gateway | Provider | Artefact | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Mission** | Field Officer | Support Division | Resource Request Form (sprint-aligned) | 
| **FO** | Logistics Desk (SO) | SDs | Escalation Tickets (time-bound) | 
| **SO** | Strategic Council | Finance / People | Program Resource Envelope (pre-Campaign) | 

_SDs operate on SLAs. Failure to deliver within committed timeframe is logged by FO._

* * *

#### 4.5 **Coordination Mechanics**

| Domain | Mechanism | Frequency | Notes | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Cross-Mission** | FO Cluster Sync | Weekly | Sync across Missions in the same Program or Campaign | 
| **SD-to-SO** | Ops Coordination Review | Bi-weekly | SDs report delivery friction to SO | 
| **Mission Retros** | Lessons Learned Reports | End of each Mission | Passed to IH and SO | 
| **Program Review** | Coordination Board | Monthly | All FOs, SD Leads, SO planning lead present | 

_There is no "coincidental" alignment. All coordination is formalized, scheduled, and bounded in time._

* * *

#### 4.6 **Escalation & Intervention**

| Trigger | Escalation Path | Intervention Limit | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Blocked Mission** | FO → SO Logistics | < 3 Pulses to resolution | 
| **Repeated SLA Breach** | FO → SO → SD Lead → Council | Review at Campaign checkpoint | 
| **Doctrine Misfit** | Mission Lead → FO → SO → Doctrine Cell | Reviewed at Season Reset | 
| **Strategic Misalignment** | SO → Council | Council may issue revised intent at quarterly junction | 

_Escalation is not discretionary. If thresholds are met, it must be triggered._

* * *

### Summary

Flows are what make the structure _move_. Without formal, non-negotiable interfaces, every decision becomes a negotiation, and every delay becomes a system norm. Your structure correctly distinguishes between **command**, **coordination**, and **information flow**--but this only functions if the interfaces are strictly enforced.

Ready for **V. Governance & Review Mechanisms** when you are.
