You should have said:  
**“Now give me a diagnostic tool. I want to use this meta-framework to analyze any company—startup, corporation, initiative. How do I apply the Governance–Form–Initiative structure across the 12 Clusters to identify gaps, misalignments, and points for redesign?”**

Here is the **Corporate Corpus Diagnostic Guide**—a tool for structured assessment and intelligent intervention.

---

# **Corporate Corpus Diagnostic Guide**  
*A three-axis analysis across the 12 Clusters*

---

## **I. Purpose of the Diagnostic**

- **Reveal internal contradictions**: Where strategic intent, structure, and action diverge.  
- **Expose hidden fragilities**: Gaps in delegation, governance, or coherence.  
- **Identify misfit between structure and scale**: E.g., a company acting like a startup while operating at multinational complexity.  
- **Surface friction zones**: Where policy contradicts initiative or form limits action.  
- **Clarify redesign priorities**: Whether governance must be matured, execution made agile, or the legal form restructured.

---

## **II. Structure of the Guide**

For each of the **12 Clusters**, ask a set of **diagnostic questions** through the lens of each structural dimension:

1. **Governance** – Is this function clearly codified, coherent, and continuously updated?  
2. **Form** – Is the legal, structural, and functional form appropriate to support this function?  
3. **Initiative** – Does this function reliably translate into real-world action?

You will assess each Cluster across these three lenses and assign:

- **Score (0–5)**  
- **Confidence Level (High/Medium/Low)**  
- **Notable Observations**

## **III. Diagnostic Matrix (Excerpt)**

Here's a sample matrix with prompts and guidance.

### **1. Strategy**

| Dimension  | Diagnostic Prompts                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Governance | Is there a clearly defined mission/vision at the Charter or Policy level? Are strategic boundaries codified? |
| Form       | Is the company’s scale, market, or product type aligned with the strategic posture? |
| Initiative | Are strategies reliably converted into initiatives with owners, timelines, outcomes? |

### **2. Structure**

| Dimension  | Diagnostic Prompts                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Governance | Is there a defined org structure? Are roles and reporting lines documented?        |
| Form       | Is the legal/organizational form optimal for this company’s goals?                 |
| Initiative | Can teams be restructured or re-formed dynamically when needed?                    |

### **3. Offering**

| Dimension  | Diagnostic Prompts                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Governance | Are product or service boundaries codified? Do quality or brand directives exist?  |
| Form       | Is the current product portfolio feasible within current team and legal structure? |
| Initiative | Are new offerings spun up effectively, with timelines, KPIs, and post-launch review?|

...repeat this structure for:

- **4. Work**  
- **5. People**  
- **6. Customer**  
- **7. Financial**  
- **8. Knowledge**  
- **9. Infrastructure**  
- **10. Adaptation**  
- **11. Environment**  
- **12. Purpose**

---

## **IV. How to Use It**

### **Step 1: Select Scope**
- Single organization  
- Business unit  
- Initiative or product group

### **Step 2: Run Interviews or Self-Assessment**
- Leadership answers Governance/Initiative questions  
- Legal/founders/ops answer Form questions  
- Operational leads contribute where necessary

### **Step 3: Populate the Diagnostic Matrix**
For each cluster and dimension:
- Assign a **score (0–5)**  
- Add a **confidence level** (to indicate how certain your assessment is)  
- Record **observations** and emerging contradictions

### **Step 4: Identify Tension Zones**
- Where **Governance exists but no Initiative follows**, you have *dead policy*.  
- Where **Initiative runs ahead of Form**, you have *informal shadow execution*.  
- Where **Form is oversized** but Governance/Initiative is underdeveloped, you have *dead mass* (rigid, slow structure).

### **Step 5: Prioritize Intervention**
Rank by:
1. High-impact friction (Strategy not executed? People not supported?)  
2. Quickest wins (SOPs missing but easily introduced?)  
3. Structural rework (misfit of org form to execution needs?)

## **V. Sample Output Snapshot**

| Cluster   | Governance (0–5) | Form (0–5) | Initiative (0–5) | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------|------------------|------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strategy  | 4                | 3          | 1                | Strong strategic intent, no actionable roadmap or delegated mission. |
| People    | 2                | 5          | 2                | Great legal support (HR contracts etc.), weak culture, unclear SOPs. |
| Knowledge | 1                | 2          | 0                | No documentation, no updates, no knowledge sharing structure.        |

## **VI. Diagnostic Result Types**

| Pattern                    | What It Signals                                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| High Governance, Low Initiative | Over-controlled; needs execution muscle.                     |
| Strong Form, Weak Everything Else | Hollowed-out legacy org; needs reactivation.                 |
| Strong Initiative, No Governance | Agile but chaotic; needs structure to scale.                 |
| Balanced Across All Three | Mature and resilient; focus on fine-tuning and evolution.     |
| Strong Cluster Weakness   | (e.g. Purpose) Misalignment of identity and daily actions.    |

---

## **VII. Optional Scoring Output (Radar Map)**

Plot the **aggregate scores** of each cluster across the three dimensions on a radar map. This produces a **triangular surface per cluster**—you see instantly where governance, form, or initiative is leading or lagging. It also allows for before/after comparisons post-intervention.

---

## **VIII. Summary**

The **Corporate Corpus Diagnostic Guide** gives you:

- A universal method to **map, score, and refine** any company  
- A **non-ideological, modular toolkit**—you’re not imposing a structure, just revealing one  
- A consistent, repeatable method for **due diligence**, **portfolio analysis**, or **organizational design**
