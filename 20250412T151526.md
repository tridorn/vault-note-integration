# Law of Success

103

Human brain as a battery that can be depleted (leading to a lack of energy, feeling of discouragement) and recharged by getting into contact with a more vital mind/minds.

Blending of more than one harmonized minds into a single one to achieve even greater things

Power and success are practically synonymous. One grows out of the other.

Harmony is the chief stone for any definite aim in life.

Power grows out of organized knowledge.

A person may become a walking encyclopedia of knowledge without possessing any power of value. This knowledge becomes power only to the extent that it is organized, classified, and put into action.

An educated person is one who knows how to acquire everything needed in the attainment of their main purpose in life.

If you learn to exploit the knowledge of others for your own projects it is as much their knowledge as it is yours.Â 

Ability to bring people together is the chief outstanding quality of Leadership
