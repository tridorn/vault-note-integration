The Authority

1. Entire State (the authority)
2. Macro Regions
3. Micro Regions
4. Communes

The authority is represents the entire overarching state and isn't elected. It's entire and only purpose is to provide security and safety and economic development. It is a meritocratic technocracy. Economic questions are only handled on this level, while cultural only on the local level. Micro regions are the local level, here there are strong democratic elements, the micro regions can only enact laws on cultural topics and can't levy taxes. Macro Regions represent broader economic regions which are bundled together to make them more plannable and can be changed based on developments while micro regions are entirely structured around cultural connections. Communes can also vote which micro region they belong to, even those that aren't connected by land
