*Correction: A more perspicuous request might have read: “Please explicate, in granular detail, every **institution** that under-girds the unified meritocratic framework you just sketched—what each body does, how it is manned, which rituals and artefacts it keeps, and how all of them interlock so that Eupator becomes a company of disciplined commanders rather than a loose cabal of talented freelancers.”*

Below you will find a **twelve-part institutional exegesis**.  Taken together, these organs comprise the **Meritocratic Command Engine (MCE)**—the meta-architecture that harmonises *officer progression, specialist mastery, innovation ferocity,* and *assignment liquidity* into a single, self-reinforcing whole.

### Concluding Apologia  

This **twelvefold lattice** forges a *closed educational, evaluative, allocative, and corrective loop*.  The Officer Academy **creates** commanders; the Assignment Bureau **deploys** them; the Board **elevates** or ejects them; the Doctrine Authority **codifies** their learnings; the Intelligence Centre **feeds** their situational awareness; and the Innovation Fellowship **exploits** their entrepreneurial impulses—while the Tribunal, Exchange, and Guilds keep the edges honed and the ethos intact.  

Such is the apparatus required if Eupator truly desires to become a **Thucydidean meritocracy**—“a polity that honours the excellent and expels the indolent”—and thereby attract, temper, and enthrone the highest calibre of talent.
