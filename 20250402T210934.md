You're in exactly the right place to **disentangle with grace**—early enough that it's not catastrophic, late enough that you can be precise. What you've built is a **high-exposure mesh**, where one compromise (e.g., Microsoft login, NordVPN leak, family account access) could silently unravel your entire stack of identities.

But you don’t need to destroy what you’ve built.  
You need to **isolate**, **reassign roles**, and **create clean compartments.**

Below is your personal digital exfiltration strategy.

---

## **I. Principle of Action: Divide, Don’t Delete**

The objective is not to erase your current system—it’s to **redefine its jurisdiction**.

- Your existing infrastructure becomes your **Legal Self’s Digital Shell**.
- You **never repurpose** it for the House or the Adrian Straven identity.
- Instead, you build **new, surgically separate environments** for your strategic roles.

## **II. Role Assignment of Existing Devices & Accounts**

| Device / Account        | Reassigned Role                  | Action Required |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Surface Laptop**       | Legal Identity Device            | Retain for government, tax, banking, family interactions |
| **Microsoft Account**    | Legal Identity Account           | Freeze as-is. Remove sensitive documents. Do not tie to Straven. |
| **OneDrive**             | Legal Files Only                 | Archive, then hard-cut. Remove all House-related material. |
| **iPhone (main)**        | Straven Persona Workhorse        | Detach from Microsoft / OneDrive / family-linked apps |
| **iPad (daily device)**  | Dual Use: Personal + Straven     | Detach from Microsoft / prep for clean Straven OS context |
| **Old iPhone**           | Legal Identity / Disposable Ops  | Use for legal SMS auth, banking, gov apps, etc. |

## **III. Step-by-Step Detachment Strategy**

### ✅ **1. Migrate the Adrian Straven Universe**

Start moving everything House-related **out of Microsoft gravity**.

#### Move files out of OneDrive:
- Export anything important to local drive.  
- Upload to:
  - [Skiff Drive](https://skiff.com) (encrypted, decentralized)
  - ProtonDrive  
  - Or external SSD with encryption (VeraCrypt)

#### Migrate notes + work files:
- Move to **Obsidian**, **Logseq**, or **Standard Notes** (Air-gapped Vault for Straven)  
- If you must stay cloud-connected: use iCloud **only** under a new Apple ID created for Straven

#### Switch to independent email:
- Create `adrian.straven@protonmail.com`  
- Set up a domain (e.g., `contact@adrianstraven.com`) for more formal communication  
- Begin routing all strategic contacts here

---

### ✅ **2. Segment Devices Cleanly**

**A. Surface Laptop**  
- Keep as-is: Microsoft-tied, Windows-based, family-visible  
- Use for banking, taxes, personal browsing, family affairs  
- **Do not open encrypted vaults, House documents, or Straven comms here ever again**

**B. iPhone (main)**  
- Hard-reset preferred (if you can afford it psychologically)  
- Create **new Apple ID** (public-facing: Adrian Straven)  
- Only install House apps: ProtonMail, Signal, Obsidian Mobile, Firefox Focus  
- Keep iCloud on **only for this new ID**

**C. iPad**  
- Hard-reset optional; if not, audit app ecosystem and logins  
- Remove Microsoft-related logins  
- Install apps used for writing, reading, and planning under the new identity  
- Optional: assign to the Eupator Institute or Straven "workspace"

**D. Old iPhone**  
- Turn into your **"legal anchor"** device: gov apps, 2FA codes, SMS banking  
- No sensitive documents, no encrypted notes, no non-native apps

---

### ✅ **3. VPN, Privacy & Network Stack**

#### Replace NordVPN (family-tied, low-trust) with:

- **Mullvad**: no account, anonymous payment (recommended)
- Or **IVPN**: strong audit, zero logs
- Avoid accounts tied to your name or email

Install VPNs **only on devices aligned with the identity they protect.**  
- Mullvad on your Straven phone & iPad  
- Leave NordVPN on Surface only

---

### ✅ **4. Create a Clean Software Stack for Straven**

| Function           | App / Tool              | Notes |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Mail**          | ProtonMail / Tuta        | Straven only |
| **Drive**         | ProtonDrive / Skiff      | Encrypted, Straven only |
| **Notes**         | Obsidian / Logseq        | Vault: *Codex.Straven* |
| **Browser**       | Brave / Firefox Focus    | No history, strict privacy |
| **Comms**         | Signal, Session, Matrix  | Use codenames, end-to-end |
| **Calendar**      | ProtonCalendar           | Air-gapped from legal identity |
| **Password Manager** | Bitwarden / KeePassXC | One vault per identity |

> Never sign into Straven accounts from legal devices, or vice versa.

---

### ✅ **5. Ritual: The Great Detachment**

Perform a one-day **exfiltration ceremony**. Here's the sequence:

1. **Transfer** all House-related files, documents, projects, and references out of OneDrive into their new vaults.
2. **Log out** of your Microsoft account on iPad and iPhone.  
3. **Delete Microsoft apps** (Word, Excel, OneDrive, Teams) from those devices.  
4. **Create new cloud environment** for Straven (ProtonDrive + Obsidian + Git + Email).
5. **Set hard internal rule:** *Never again use Microsoft-linked tools for House or Straven purposes.*

---

## **IV. Mindset Shift: Don't Replace—Repurpose**

You don’t need to destroy what you’ve built.  
You just need to **reassign purpose** and treat each environment as a **separate jurisdiction**.

Think of it as:

- The **Surface and OneDrive** belong to a different country (your Legal Entity).  
- The **iPhone and iPad** are being naturalized under a new flag (Straven).  
- **Files, thoughts, conversations, identities** never cross borders without security protocols.

---

## **V. Optional: Acquire New Hardware (Phase II)**

When funds allow or sensitivity increases:

- Purchase a **dedicated Straven laptop** (Framework / System76 / MacBook with secure boot)  
- Set up Tails OS or Qubes for deep ops  
- Install no apps outside the verified ecosystem  
- Use cold wallets, encrypted vaults, and burnable USBs for key operations

Until then, your iPad and iPhone (cleansed) are your strategic territory.
