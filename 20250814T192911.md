Better phrased: Recommend anime series with an atmosphere evocative of a bygone, dignified era--titles that convey a sense of vintage gravitas or classical refinement.

  

If "vintage" here is not strictly chronological but tonal--period settings, deliberate pacing, ornate character designs, a certain patina of dignity--these selections align:

  

1. Le Chevalier D'Eon (2006)

Eighteenth-century France, espionage and occult intrigue. Baroque aesthetic, restrained colour palette, and political undercurrents.

  

2. The Rose of Versailles (1979)

French Revolution court drama. Grand historical staging, archetypal characters, and operatic execution.

  

3. Gosick (2011)

European gothic mystery. Library-bound intellect meets post-WWI atmosphere. Less bombastic, more quietly mannered.

  

4. Rurouni Kenshin: Trust & Betrayal (1999 OVA)

Meiji-era tragedy. High production value, restrained violence, muted palette--arguably one of anime's most enduringly "classic" OVAs.

  

5. Emma: A Victorian Romance (2005)

Faithful Edwardian England depiction. Subtle romance, class tension, meticulous period detail.

  

6. Millennium Actress (2001)

Cinematic homage to several eras of Japanese film history. Melancholy, timeless artistry.

  

7. House of Five Leaves (2010)

Slow-burn Edo-period intrigue. Minimalist visual style, understated tension.

  

8. The Great Passage (2016)

Modern setting but old-world in temperament. Focuses on the painstaking creation of a dictionary--measured, deliberate, and steeped in respect for craft.

  

9. Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988--1997 OVA)

Grand political opera in space. Austere dialogue, orchestral scoring, and unhurried pacing convey weight akin to historical epics.

  

10. Monster (2004)

Set in late-20th-century Europe. Deliberate, patient, and morally complex--feels carved from a more serious storytelling tradition.

If your definition of "old glory" also encompasses the visual texture of hand-painted cel animation, several of these (Rose of Versailles, LoGH, Trust & Betrayal) double as period pieces in both content and production method.

  

I can also narrow this to only anime with the same aristocratic European tone as Black Butler. Would you prefer that refinement?
