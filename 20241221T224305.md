Here's a structured system based on your idea, designed to help you track and motivate income generation while building wealth systematically:

---

### **The Personal Productivity Income System (PPIS)**

#### **1. Core Concept**

- Assign a monetary value (Hourly Income Requirement, or **HIR**) to each of your "working hours" (16 hours/day).
- Deduct the corresponding amount (HIR × hours elapsed) from your "available funds" every day.
- The deducted amount is transferred to an **investment fund** that builds wealth over time.
- To "break even," you must generate an income equal to or exceeding your daily HIR total.

#### **2. System Details**

1. **Hourly Income Requirement (HIR)**:
	- Start with a low, manageable amount: **€1/hour**.
	- Daily target: **€16/day** (16 working hours × €1/hour).
	- Monthly target: ~€480 (based on 30 days).
	- Adjust HIR as you grow more confident in generating income.

2. **Daily Wealth Deduction**:
	- Every hour that passes deducts the HIR from your available balance.
	- Example: At €1/hour, if 8 hours pass, **€8 is removed** from your balance.
	- At the end of the day, the total (€16) is automatically transferred to your investment account.

3. **Income Goal**:
	- Your goal each day is to earn enough to "replenish" the €16 deducted.
	- Any income beyond €16 is yours to spend, save, or invest further.

4. **Investment Fund**:
	- The deducted amount is **locked** in an investment account, ensuring it builds wealth passively.
	- Choose low-risk investments to start (e.g., ETFs or index funds).

5. **Tracking System**:
	- Use a spreadsheet, app, or journal to track:
	  - Hours worked.
	  - Income generated.
	  - Amount transferred to investments.
	  - Daily, weekly, and monthly progress.

6. **Idling Penalty**:
	- Each unproductive hour costs you €1 (or your current HIR).
	- This creates a sense of urgency to spend time productively.

7. **Incentives**:
	- Surplus income (beyond your daily HIR target) can be used for rewards.
	- Example: If you earn €20 in a day, €16 goes to break even, and €4 can be spent as you wish.

#### **3. Example Workflow**

1. **Morning Setup**:
	- Your daily HIR target is €16.
	- Track the hours you plan to work productively.
	
2. **Throughout the Day**:
	- Log any income you generate (freelancing, part-time work, side gigs).
	- Monitor your progress toward the daily HIR.

3. **End of the Day**:
	- Deduct €16 from your balance (if you didn’t earn it).
	- Transfer this amount to your investment fund.
	- If you earned more than €16, enjoy the surplus or invest it.

#### **4. Long-Term Benefits**

- Builds **financial discipline** by tying time to monetary value.
- Encourages **active income generation** through productive work.
- Creates a **wealth-building habit** by investing consistently.
- Provides a **motivational metric** to assign value to your time.

#### **5. Flexibility & Scaling**

- Adjust your HIR as your earning potential grows:
  - Example: After a month of consistent income, raise it to €1.50/hour (€24/day).
- Expand income streams to meet and exceed your targets.
- Set milestones for your investment fund (e.g., €1,000, €5,000).

### **Key Implementation Tools**

- **Spreadsheets**: Use Excel or Google Sheets for tracking hours, income, and deductions.
- **Apps**: Consider using financial apps like YNAB (You Need a Budget) or personal finance trackers.
- **Automation**: Set up automatic transfers to your investment account at the end of each day or week.

This system creates accountability while nudging you to value your time and grow your income. Would you like help setting up a spreadsheet or finding tools to track this?
