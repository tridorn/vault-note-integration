# Hybrid Analogue–Digital Note-Taking Framework

### Core Principles

1. **Capture vs. curation**: Handwriting for speed and comprehension, Markdown for structured storage.
2. **One-way migration**: Analogue → digital only; forces synthesis.
3. **Minimum viable digitisation**: No transcription, just distilled insights.
4. **Atomicity**: Each idea isolated for later recombination.
5. **Search > fidelity**: Prioritise summaries, tags, keywords.

### Process

**Step 1 – Analogue capture while reading**

* Dedicated notebook or 3×5 cards.
* Two inks: content vs. synthesis.
* Symbols for action (@), monetisation (\$), uncertainty (?).
* Summarise in own words.

**Step 2 – Immediate review**

* After reading, highlight 20–30% of high-leverage notes.
* Cluster on cards, flag in notebook.

**Step 3 – Digital migration**

* One Markdown file per book: `YYYY-MM-DD_Title_Author.md`.
* Structure:

  * Core thesis (1 paragraph)
  * 3–5 takeaways
  * Key concepts with summaries + implications
  * Selected quotes
  * Actions / experiments
  * Tags
* “Atomic” ideas → separate `/concepts/` files, linked back.
* Consistent domain (#sales, #product) and stage (#idea, #scale) tags.

**Step 4 – Weekly consolidation**

* Review `/concepts/`.
* Create thematic index files (e.g., Pricing Strategies.md).

### Tooling

* Analogue: A5 dot-grid + 3×5 cards.
* Digital: Folder-based Markdown app (Obsidian or git).
* Archival: Optional photos of notes in `/raw_notes/`, no OCR.

### Trade-offs

* Distilled, not exhaustive.
* Migration throughput \~30–60 min per book.
* Bottleneck: analogue review; skipping it degrades quality.
