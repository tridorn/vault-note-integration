# Summary of 2025-03-01

## Overview

---

## 00:00 To 11:00

Originally I decided that I'm not allowed sleep the core (22:30 to 03:00) as a punishment for not adhering to the 10 oaths during the day. I became weak at about 01:00 and decided to go to sleep with an alarm for 06:00. I however massively overslept (through the reoccurring problem of turning off my alarm half-asleep) until about 11:00

## 11:00 To 14:00

Nothing of note happened in this span of time, I ate breakfast, and had a phone call at about 12:30 with Jac. That is about it.
