# Objective

Extract decision-grade principles and executable plays. Outputs: atomic notes, one decision, one micro-experiment, linked into your maps.

# Protocol (3.5 days per book)

## Pre-commit triage (15–20 min)

* Scan TOC, index, intro, conclusion, two random pages.
* Write REF thread; set kill rule (abort at 20% if <2 actionable cards).

## Day 1 – Surface map (2–3h read, 30–45m sweep)

* Open WIP thread with focus and kill rule.
* Capture 30–60 cards, max 10 per chapter, one idea each, ID format YYDOY-SS.
* End sweep: photo cards to /\_inbox; select 8–12 best for distillation.
* If kill rule triggers: DEC thread, stop, park synthesis.

## Day 2 AM – Distil (60–90m)

* Select 10 cards only.
* For each: one markdown note (statement, evidence, implication, action) with full timestamp ID.
* Link to one map and one project. If unlinked, demote.

## Day 2 PM – Synthesis (45–60m)

* Source dossier: 150–200 words on thesis, scope, high-signal pages, links to notes.
* Workbook: EXP threads for experiments, TASK threads to task manager.

## Day 3 – Application (90–120m execution, 20m log)

* Pick one play or experiment.
* Write experiment file (hypothesis, metrics, guardrails, sample, dates).
* Run minimal version same day. Log outcomes; link back to workbook.

## Buffer (30–45m)

* Final 200-word synthesis: strengths, gaps, reuse context.
* Cull 3 weak notes or merge duplicates.
* Move 1–2 high-value notes to Leitner review.
* Set 30-day review on any decisions.

# Capture rules

* Keep when 2 of 3 apply: near-term decision, testable behavior/metric, contradiction of prior principle.
* Ignore generic exhortations, decorative stories, redundant definitions.

# Workbook grammar

* REF: triage + kill criteria
* DEC: commit, reverse, or time-box
* EXP: play → test with guardrails
* LOG: record measurable outcomes
* TASK: push to task system

# Genre adaptations

* Handbooks: capture Plays, Metrics, ignore narrative.
* Frameworks: capture Principles, Counterexamples; delay Plays.
* Case collections: capture Patterns, Risks; synthesize.
* Academic texts: extract Metrics, Definitions, boundaries.

# Decision gates

* Gate 1 (20%): abort if <2 actionable cards.
* Gate 2 (post-distil): exactly 10 atomic notes.
* Gate 3 (post-Day 3): if no play/decision, mark reference only.

# Metrics

* Capture selectivity: kept/total, target ≤30%.
* Encode latency: capture → markdown under 48h.
* Action ratio: ≥60% of plays executed.
* Retrieval speed: 3 notes in <2 min.

# Minimal kit

* A6 dot-grid cards (max 30 carried), 0.5–0.7 pen.
* Phone shortcut: photo → /\_inbox with timestamp.
* Pre-saved templates: Note, Experiment, Decision, Source.
* Weekly merge pass to prune duplicates, link into maps.

# Failure modes

* Over-annotation → 10-note cap, kill rule.
* Summarising drift → every note needs Action.
* Media fragmentation → stable IDs, daily sweep.
* Decision amnesia → ADR-style records with review dates.

# One-page checklist

1. Triage 15m, REF, kill rule.
2. Capture 30–60 cards, 10 cap per chapter, photo sweep.
3. Distil 10 atomic notes, link each to map + project.
4. Create one experiment or play, execute or schedule.
5. Source dossier: 200 words, high-signal pages, links.
6. Cull 3 notes, add 1–2 to Leitner.
7. Log outcomes, set review dates.
