# 6-Step Analogue-to-Markdown Book Notes Workflow

1. **Finish reading and mark for extraction**

   * After the last chapter, scan handwritten notes.
   * Highlight only 20–30% of reusable insights.
   * Symbols: @ (experiment), \$ (monetisation), ? (open question), ! (critical insight).

2. **Distil the core thesis**

   * One paragraph in your own words.
   * State the problem the book addresses and its effect on decisions.

3. **Extract 3–5 strategic takeaways**

   * Express as rules: “If X, then Y” or “When A, apply B”.
   * Avoid vagueness, tie to leverage points.

4. **Create the Markdown file**

   * Filename: YYYY-MM-DD\_Title\_Author.md
   * Template (≤1,000 words):

     ```
     # Title — Author  
     ## Date Finished: YYYY-MM-DD  
     ## Core Thesis  
     …  
     ## 3–5 Strategic Takeaways  
     - …  
     ## Key Concepts  
     ### Concept  
     Summary + implications + action  
     ## Actions / Experiments  
     - …  
     ## Tags  
     #tag1 #tag2 #tag3
     ```

5. **Spawn atomic concept files**

   * For standalone, reusable ideas, create files in /concepts/.
   * Link back to the source book.
   * Keep tags consistent.

6. **Link and consolidate weekly**

   * Review /concepts/ and interlink related ideas.
   * Update thematic index files (e.g. Pricing.md, Prototyping.md).
   * Archive analogue pages in /raw\_notes/ with identical filenames.
