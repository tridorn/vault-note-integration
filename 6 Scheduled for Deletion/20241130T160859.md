# Conceptualisation: Input

---

## Objectives

**Purpose:** To define the input phase of conceptualisation and clearly explain how to apply it.

**Goals:**
1. Describe its purpose
2. List what is put into it
3. Give examples of application

**Key Questions:**
1. How much content should be put into it (in relation to process and output)?
2. What exactly is its scope?
3. How much linking should be done?
4. How should I generally structure it (mostly using headlines, in a flow or as paragraph, etc.)?
5. What are common (reusable) parts of the system?
