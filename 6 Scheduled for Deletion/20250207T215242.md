# 2025-02-07 Friday

Today I woke up at 03:00 and maintained my sleeping routine (at least the waking ones, didn't fall asleep in both naps) throughout the day.

The first intra-cycle was spent refining the new timeframes approach, in the second I did some other work, in the third I mostly idled and the fourth was spent going for a walk in a starry night on a Friday where other people go visit the cultural institution of Franklin Villages in droves and barely not falling asleep.

It was an acceptable day, I didn't produce much of value in physical terms, I didn't drift into the negative either tho. I followed a steady rhythm, and even my awareness of the one and the four was alright.

Tomorrow is going to be even better.

I am thankful for the challenges and opportunities to prove my virtue.
