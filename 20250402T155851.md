**Absolutely. Here’s a precise, orchestrated 5-slide pitch setup** for your practice presentation today—with **what to show on each slide**, and **what to say out loud** in each segment. This version is tailored for a **1-on-1 or small group context**, where you want to come across as **professional, international, and vision-driven**, yet emotionally resonant. You’ll speak in English, calmly, clearly, with an understated passion.

## **Slide 1 – "The Forgotten Climate Actor"**  
### **Visual:**  
- Full-screen photo of a real-looking small business (a bakery, auto repair shop, or vineyard—not a cliché solar panel)  
- A quote: _“We’d love to go green, but we don’t even know where to begin.”_ — Mariya, bakery owner, Romania

### **What to Say:**  
> “Across Eastern Europe, millions of family-run businesses want to do the right thing—switch to green technologies, reduce energy costs, and take climate action. But they’re not multinationals.  
>   
> Mariya, who runs a bakery near Cluj, wants to install a more efficient oven that cuts her gas use by 40%. She asks her bank. The response? _‘That’s too small. Too complicated.’_  
>   
> This is the reality for tens of thousands of SMEs today. They want to help. But they’re stuck in a system not designed for them.”

---

## **Slide 2 – “A System That Leaves SMEs Behind”**  
### **Visual:**  
- 3 boxes/columns:  
   - **Confusing Application Process** (icons: form, exclamation mark)  
   - **Fragmented Funding Landscape** (EU, bank, government logos floating disconnected)  
   - **No Trusted Vendor Access** (icon: question mark over solar installer)

### **What to Say:**  
> “What Mariya runs into isn’t bad intention—it’s bad infrastructure.  
> - She doesn’t know what counts as a ‘green’ project.  
> - EU programs, bank loans, and government subsidies each have different paperwork.  
> - She has no idea who to trust for installation.  
>   
> Meanwhile, banks like ProCredit want to lend green—this is your strategic mission. But smaller loans are too costly to process. Everyone loses.”

**Pause briefly. Let the reality sink in.**

## **Slide 3 – “GreenBridge: Building the Rails for Green Lending”**  
### **Visual:**  
A clean visual with 4 icons in a horizontal flow:  
1. **SME enters project idea**  
2. **Platform auto-estimates ROI & carbon savings**  
3. **Generates lender-ready project packet**  
4. **Connects to financing + vendor**

Below: tagline: _“From idea to impact, in one system.”_

### **What to Say:**  
> “GreenBridge is a digital platform that helps SMEs scope, qualify, and apply for green upgrades—without needing consultants, or endless forms.  
>   
> It standardizes green project data, so banks get loan requests with clean, verifiable metrics—carbon savings, ROI, repayment confidence—all in a consistent format.  
>   
> And we’re building this as infrastructure: one shared rail that connects SMEs, banks, vendors, and public programs.”

## **Slide 4 – “Why It Matters to ProCredit”**  
### **Visual:**  
Two columns:  
**Today** vs **With GreenBridge**  
- SME leads: scattered vs. qualified pipeline  
- Loan review: manual vs. 70% time saved  
- Compliance: complex vs. automated dossier  
- Impact: underleveraged vs. visible portfolio growth

### **What to Say:**  
> “ProCredit has led the way in green SME finance—especially in the Balkans. But the cost of acquisition and verification for smaller projects slows that growth.  
>   
> With GreenBridge, you could:  
> - Acquire more SME clients with cleaner data  
> - Increase your green loan volume without increasing your headcount  
> - Hit ESG targets faster with less friction  
> - And strengthen your position as the most accessible green bank in the region.”

## **Slide 5 – “Let’s Build This Together”**  
### **Visual:**  
A clean visual with 3 bullet points + your logo:  
- **Pilot idea**: Co-develop a prototype around one loan product or region  
- **Low-lift**: We handle UX, scoping, documentation logic  
- **High upside**: Build trust, impact, and pipeline—fast

### **What to Say:**  
> “We’re not here to sell a tool. We’re here to build something with you that unlocks capital, enables your mission, and empowers local businesses.  
>   
> Our ask is simple: let’s explore a pilot—maybe in one region, with one loan product. We’ll bring the prototype. You bring the insight.  
>   
> Could we schedule a short follow-up to see where this fits your roadmap?”

**Then pause and listen. Be quiet. Let them respond.**

---

## **Language Note**
Because you’re pitching in a professional, semi-international context, and because the **ProCredit representative will almost certainly be comfortable with English**, **you should absolutely pitch in English**. It sends a strong, subtle signal that:
- You’re building for **international scalability**, not provincial operations  
- You’re **serious about partnership and professionalism**  
- You see yourself as **pan-European from day one**

If anyone is confused or unsure, offer to clarify individual terms or explain in German afterward—but stay English as your **default operating language**.

---

## **Final Notes**
- Speak slowly, clearly, calmly—**don’t oversell, be confident in the quality of the idea**  
- Smile once; then focus  
- Close with a warm but professional line:  
  > _“Thanks for listening. We’d really appreciate your perspective—and we’d love to explore whether this might serve ProCredit’s mission even more directly.”_

If you want, I can format these slides into an actual deck for you—just say the word.
