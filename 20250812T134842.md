---

Love the push for one system to rule them all. Here's a unified, dual‑purpose note model that works for projects, book notes, research articles--everything--without feeling "action-only."

  

It keeps the dual sides for every block:

- Meta (YAML): machine‑readable facts (source of truth for data).
- Body (H2): human story (the main piece). You can mirror bits of meta into the body with Dataview, but the prose lives here.

# The unified primitives (12 blocks)

  

These are small, composable, and neutral (work for static and action notes).

1. identity -- what this is

2. intent -- why it exists / what you want to learn/achieve

3. sources -- bibliographic/authoritative references (kept separate from inputs)

4. inputs -- non‑bibliographic materials (datasets, prompts, requirements, assets)

5. method -- how you'll/you did proceed (reading or research or build method)

6. content -- the actual note body (summary, analysis, draft, etc.)

7. findings -- observations/highlights/results (quotes or measurements)

8. conclusions -- claims/summary/decision (neutral name that fits all)

9. next -- follow‑ups (tasks or open questions)

10. state -- lifecycle + classification (stage/status/project/tags/dates)

11. ledger -- time‑ordered change log (audit trail)

12. links -- parent/children/depends_on/related

  

> Rationale:

- > sources vs inputs are split to respect traditional bibliographic discipline.
- > content/findings/conclusions map cleanly to book notes (summary → highlights → takeaways) and to research/projects (analysis → results → decisions).
- > next/state/ledger are lightweight governance you can leave empty for static notes.

stage moves with work

ledger

 | 

major revisions

 | 

versioned analysis notes

 | 

run logs, iterations

 | 
| 

links

 | 

themes/series

 | 

related studies

 | 

dependencies/risks

 | 

No special templates per type; the same 12 blocks behave polymorphically.

# Why this works (rational criteria)

- Universality: Every knowledge artifact has (1) identity, (2) purpose, (3) material, (4) method, (5) body, (6) evidence, (7) conclusions, (8) some future/closure stance, (9) governance, (10) connections.
- Separation of concerns: sources (bibliography) and inputs (non‑bib) are distinct; avoids muddling traditional practices.
- Dual‑purpose clarity: facts in Meta; meaning in Body. Dataview mirrors but never replaces prose.
- Static‑friendly: You can leave method/next/state/ledger sparse without breaking structure.
- Action‑capable: For living notes, method/next/state/ledger become first‑class.
- Queryable: All machine‑useful bits are structured; dashboards/lists remain trivial.

  

If you want, I can turn this into an Obsidian template with Dataview snippets that auto‑render meta summaries under each H2 (e.g., a compact bibliography table under ## sources, a chips view for state, etc.).
