# Managing the Lifecycle of a Book (Condensed)

### 1. Selection

* **Discovery**: Use Goodreads for recommendations, reviews, and lists; Apple Books for new releases and curated suggestions.
* **Decision**: Add titles to Goodreads “want to read” or Apple Books wish list.

### 2. Acquisition

* **Purchase/Download**: Buy through Apple Books or acquire physical copies. Record acquisitions on Goodreads.

### 3. Reading

* **Start**: Read in Apple Books (with goals) or track progress of physical books manually on Goodreads.
* **Annotations**: Apple Books for highlights/notes; for print, use sticky notes or a journal.
* **Tracking**: Apple Books logs time automatically; Goodreads for manual progress updates.

### 4. Completion

* **Mark Finished**: Update status in both Apple Books and Goodreads.
* **Review/Rate**: Write review and rating in Goodreads, optionally also in Apple Books.
* **Update Goals**: Check contribution to Goodreads yearly challenge.

### 5. Reflection

* **Personal Notes**: Keep summaries, quotes, insights in a reading journal.
* **Sharing**: Discuss in clubs, online forums, or post reviews publicly.

### 6. Library Management

* **Cataloging**: Ensure Goodreads shelves and tags reflect reality.
* **Physical**: Organize shelves in sync with digital categories.
* **Digital**: Archive finished books in Apple Books to keep the active list lean.

### 7. Goal Adjustment

* **Periodic Review**: Use Goodreads “Year in Books” and journals to reassess habits and reset goals.

### Integrated Example

1. Select via Goodreads, shortlist, acquire on Apple Books or physical.
2. Track reading in Apple Books, update Goodreads.
3. On completion, review in Goodreads and journal.
4. Archive in libraries, recalibrate goals.
