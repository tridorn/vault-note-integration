# Comments in YAML Frontmatter (Obsidian)

## Allowed

* YAML supports `#` comments.
* Obsidian and Dataview handle them without issues.
* Useful for structuring and readability.

**Example:**

```yaml
# ─── CORE ───

## Caveats

| Tool                     | Behavior                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Obsidian core / Dataview | ✅ Ignore comments, parse fine.                                                           |
| DataviewJS               | ✅ Comments stripped.                                                                     |
| Advanced YAML plugins    | ✅ Usually fine if using YAML parser.                                                     |
| External scripts         | ⚠️ Must use proper parser (`pyyaml`, `ruamel.yaml`, `js-yaml`, `yaml.v3`). Regex breaks. |
| Static site generators   | ⚠️ Often strip comments.                                                                 |

## Best Practices

* Use comments as **section headers** between blocks, not inline with values.
* Lists are fragile with inline comments.

✅ Safe:

```yaml
tags:
  - #concept
  - #retrospective
```

⚠️ Risky:

```yaml
tags:  # topic tags
  - #concept  # main
  - #retrospective  # sub
```

* Never hide actual data in comments.

## Recommendation

In a structured YAML-based system (Obsidian + Git + automation):

* Use comments for section headers and clarity.
* Keep them above blocks, never as data.
* Ensure external tools use real YAML parsers.

This balances machine readability with long-term human legibility.
