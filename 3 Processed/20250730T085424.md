## 1 Foundational Concepts

* **Axes not trees**: Storage = cartesian product of ≤3 axes.
* **Canonical axis names**: Same vocabulary everywhere, values vary.
* **Decile prefixing**: Two-digit numbers (`10_`, `20_`) fix sort order and leave gaps.
* **Lifecycle over medium**: Capture → Commit → Work → Deliver → Archive, identical for all media.
* **Append-only log**: Add new deciles, never rename.
* **Schema marker**: `SCHEMA.md` at root describes axes, version, changelog.

## 2 Canonical Axes (CCL)

1. **Content-Type** (intrinsic: note, email, file, image).
2. **Context** (client, project, domain).
3. **Lifecycle** (universal stages: `10_Capture` … `90_Archive`).

> Rule: Never add new axes. Misfits belong as values of Context or Content-Type.

---

## 3 Folder Generation Algorithm

1. **Pick primary axis** per medium:

   * Email → Context,
   * Notes → Lifecycle,
   * Cloud drive → Context, then Lifecycle.

2. **Choose depth**:

   * Flat UI → combine axes in label name.
   * Nested UI → separate into layers.

3. **Generate containers**:

   ```
   <axis_decile>_<value>/<axis_decile>_<value>/…
   ```

Unused deciles stay empty as future slots.

## 4 Examples

* **Notes (Lifecycle-first)**

  ```
  10_Capture/
  20_Triage/
  ...
  90_Archive/
     projects/   ← Context inside lifecycle
  ```

* **Email (Context-first)**

  ```
  10_Client_A/
     ├─ 20_Triage/
     ├─ 50_Build/
     └─ 60_Ship/
  20_Client_B/
  ```

* **Cloud Share (Context → Lifecycle → Content-Type)**

  ```
  10_Project_X/
     ├─ 50_Build/img, docs, src
     └─ 60_Ship/pdf, zip
  ```

## 5 Decile → Lifecycle

| Decile | Value   | Function  |
| ------ | ------- | --------- |
| `10_`  | Capture | inbox     |
| `20_`  | Triage  | decide    |
| `30_`  | Nurture | incubate  |
| `40_`  | Plan    | commit    |
| `50_`  | Build   | work      |
| `60_`  | Ship    | done      |
| `70_`  | Reflect | learn     |
| `80_`  | Library | evergreen |
| `90_`  | Archive | cold      |

Rule: Only move items between deciles to change lifecycle.

---

## 6 Schema Marker (sample)

```
# CCL Schema v1.0
Axes: Content-Type, Context, Lifecycle
Rules: deciles fixed; new contexts get next free 10-block; new lifecycle stage = new decile (e.g. 55_QA).
```

---

## 7 Automation & Interchangeability

* Programmatic mapping: `return f"{context}/{lifecycle}"`.
* Dashboards: aggregate all `20_Triage` items across media.
* Migration: rename values, not deciles.

---

## 8 Edge Cases

* Extra stage → assign free decile (`55_QA`).
* Personal projects → allocate Context decile (`30_Side_Projects`).
* Mixed media in one tool → Content-Type as third depth (docs, img, src).

---

## 9 Why It Works

* Memorise lifecycle once, reuse everywhere.
* Orthogonal axes prevent clashes.
* Deciles = durable, future-proof identifiers.
* Schema portability → fast replication across media.
