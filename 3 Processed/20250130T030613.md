# Strategies for Color-Coded Annotation

1. **Yellow**

   * Mark broad concepts or recurring themes during first reading.
   * Later, use as anchors to reconstruct the textâ€™s central argument.

2. **Green**

   * Highlight new terms, definitions, and illustrative examples.
   * Compile these into a glossary for quick reference.

3. **Blue**

   * Mark dates, numbers, and cited studies.
   * Use for fact-checking and quick retrieval of data.

4. **Pink**

   * Flag passages that provoke thought, disagreement, or deeper analysis.
   * Review before discussions to surface points of contention.

5. **Purple**

   * Note unclear passages, questions, or suspected errors.
   * Use as prompts for further research or consultation.
