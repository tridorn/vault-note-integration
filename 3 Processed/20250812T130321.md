# YAML–H2 Block System for Obsidian

A rational, extensible structure for YAML “source of truth” blocks mapped to H2 sections.

### 1. Identity

What the note is.

* title
* type (concept, project, reference, log)
* aliases
* UUID

### 2. Context

Position in broader structure.

* parent / children
* tags
* domain / category
* related

### 3. Workflow

Progress and status.

* stage (idea, draft, active, complete, archived)
* status (blocked, on-hold, review, urgent)
* priority
* due
* owner

### 4. Content

Core material.

* summary
* key\_points
* details (note body)
* questions

### 5. Evidence

References and backing.

* sources (citations, URLs)
* quotes
* attachments / media

### 6. Governance

Rules and restrictions.

* sensitivity (public, internal, confidential)
* license
* retention

### 7. Metrics

Tracking and logs.

* created
* last\_modified / last\_opened
* access\_count
* effort\_logged (time)
* completion\_%

### 8. Operations

Executable actions.

* export\_formats
* automation
* sync\_targets

### Why this system works

* Sequential logic: Identity → Context → Workflow → Content → Evidence → Governance → Metrics → Ops.
* Broad applicability across projects, research, Zettelkasten.
* Extensible “drawers” for future fields.
* Query-friendly (Dataview).
* YAML and H2 headings remain in sync.
