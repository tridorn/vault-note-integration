# Applying the System Across Domains

**Framework**: Input → Process → Output. Works across academic subjects, practical skills, and philosophical ideas. Notes in Obsidian should be concise, linked, and periodically revisited.

### 1. Academic Subject (Neuroscience: Neural Plasticity)

* **Input**: Neural plasticity = brain’s ability to adapt through synaptic change, neurogenesis, dendritic growth.
* **Process**:

  * Key questions: why it matters for learning, limits with age, use in rehab.
  * Reformulation: the brain physically changes with experience; this underlies learning and recovery.
* **Output**:

  * Insight: consistent training could maintain cognitive health.
  * Action: explore applications in aging and education.

### 2. Practical Skill (Python Variables)

* **Input**: Variables = symbolic names for stored values; dynamically typed in Python.
* **Process**:

  * Compare with statically typed languages; dynamic typing = flexible but less efficient.
  * Scope affects structure and reusability.
  * Reformulation: labels on boxes, type known at runtime.
* **Output**:

  * Insight: flexibility vs. performance trade-off.
  * Action: test scope and performance using large datasets.

### 3. Philosophical Idea (Stoicism: Amor Fati)

* **Input**: Amor fati = embrace all circumstances, not just accept but affirm.
* **Process**:

  * Aligns with focusing only on what’s in one’s control.
  * Application: reframe setbacks as growth.
  * Not passive, requires active engagement.
* **Output**:

  * Insight: adversity becomes usable fuel.
  * Action: in frustration, reframe events as necessary parts of development.

### General Practice

* **Revisiting**: add reflections, adjust with experience.
* **Linking**: connect related topics (e.g., neural plasticity ↔ aging, amor fati ↔ courage).
* **Periodic Review**: reinforce through recall.
