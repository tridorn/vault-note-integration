# Workflow for Engaging with a Book

## Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Create Central Note** in Obsidian titled with the book’s name.
2. **Add Metadata**: author, publication date, genre, expectations.
3. **Research Context**: critical reviews, summaries, discussions; note key insights.
4. **Set Goals**: define objectives and establish color/symbol scheme for annotation.

## Phase 2: Active Reading

1. **Highlighting & Annotation**

   * **Colors**: Yellow (main ideas), Blue (evidence), Green (insights), Pink (questions), Orange (contradictions).
   * **Symbols**: \* (important), ! (provocative), ? (unclear), → (link elsewhere).
   * Marginalia: summarise, question, cross-reference, reflect. Transfer to Obsidian if needed.
2. **Daily Log**: record reading progress, initial reactions, notable highlights.

## Phase 3: Structured Notes

1. **Chapter Summaries**: short synthesis, integrating highlights and marginalia.
2. **Key Takeaways**: maintain running list of overarching insights.
3. **Quotes & Citations**: collect impactful passages with context and page numbers.

## Phase 4: Expansion & Reflection

1. **Identify Key Concepts** and note them in chapter summaries.
2. **Create Concept Notes**: definition, occurrence in text, wider implications.
3. **Personal Reflections**: dedicated section on impact, challenges, growth.
4. **Cross-Referencing**: link concept notes, apply tags, build thematic connections.

## Phase 5: Synthesis & Review

1. **Comprehensive Summary**: integrate chapter notes, concepts, and reflections.
2. **Regular Review**: revisit notes, refine insights, connect with later readings.
3. **Interlinking**: diagram or note connections across books to identify patterns.
