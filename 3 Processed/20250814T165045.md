# Rationale and trade-offs

Index cards enforce atomicity, mobility, and fast recombination. Weaknesses are fragmentation, scanning drag, and loss. Mitigations: strict IDs, daily digitisation, carry cap.

# System overview

Analogue for capture and thinking, digital for retrieval and linking.

1. Capture one idea per card.
2. Distil same day: statement, evidence, implication.
3. Encode in markdown with stable IDs.
4. Review via Leitner box.
5. Reuse through project and map links.

# Card taxonomy

Minimal, action-biased types: Claim, Principle, Pattern, Metric, Play, Counterexample, Question, Quote.

# Card layout

Front: title, statement, evidence, implication.
Back: ID (YYDOY-SS), type, source + locator, 2–4 tags, links, status (inbox|distilled|encoded|applied), next action.

# Edge coding

Corner marks for sorting: top-right dot (Principle), top-left slash (Pattern), bottom-right square (Metric), bottom-left triangle (Question). Right-edge notch = action.

# Physical workflow

Three compartments: Inbox, Active, Review. Daily carry: sleeve with ≤30 cards (20 blank, 10 active).

# Encoding and markdown

Single namespace.
Directory: /notes/, /sources/, /maps/, /projects/, /\_inbox/, /archive/.
Notes carry id, type, title, source, status, tags, links, plus statement/evidence/implication/action.
Sources have thesis, key pages, key claims.
Maps cluster linked notes.

# Review cadence

Leitner, 5 slots. Intervals: daily, 3d, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly. Cap “rehearsing” at 20. Notes unused for 2 months get archived.

# Reading protocol (2 books/week)

Day 1: capture 30–60 cards, ≤10 per chapter. Mark types. Two Plays per chapter minimum.
Day 2: distil best 10 per book, encode, link.
Day 3: apply one Play per book, record outcomes.
Synthesis: 200-word source summary, update maps, cull weak notes.

# Operating constraints

• Hard cap 10 notes per chapter/hour.
• For every 5 notes, 1 Play scheduled.
• Quotes <10%.
• Encode within 72h or delete.
• Weekly merge to remove duplicates, keep stronger chains.

# Integration

Tags are closed list in /maps/\_tags.md (strategy, pricing, growth, etc). Links take precedence over tags.

# Metrics

• Capture selectivity: ≤30%.
• Encode latency: ≤48h.
• Action ratio (Plays executed/created): ≥60%.
• Retrieval time for 3 notes: ≤2 min.
• Archive rate: 20–40%.

# Failure modes

• Card loss → daily photo sweep, carry count.
• Fragmentation → weekly merge, strict linking.
• Over-capture → per-chapter caps, cull.
• Scanning drag → photo only, type top notes.
• Tag sprawl → closed vocabulary.

# Minimal kit

Cards 3x5/A6, 180–220 gsm, dot grid. Slim sleeve (30 cards). 0.5–0.7 gel pen. Slip box with 5 Leitner slots. Weekly sticker sheet of short IDs.
