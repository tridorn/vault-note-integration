# Types of Notes and the Input → Process → Output Structure

The Input → Process → Output (IPO) model is broadly adaptable, though not every note must follow it strictly. Its value lies in pushing notes beyond storage into engagement and application.

### 1. Universality of IPO

* **Input**: Captures raw information from any source.
* **Process**: Enforces analysis, reflection, questioning.
* **Output**: Synthesizes insight, conclusions, or actions.

This framework is generally useful across personal, academic, and professional notes.

### 2. Types of Notes

**Reference Notes (fact-based)**
Useful to lightly apply IPO. Prevents passive storage by clarifying *when* and *how* facts are applied.
Example: Input “F=ma” → Process “What does this imply for collisions?” → Output “Predicts forces, useful for safety engineering.”

**Conceptual/Philosophical Notes**
Best suited for full IPO use. Processing and Output layers turn abstractions into personal or actionable understanding.
Example: Amor fati → Process “Does this foster passivity or resilience?” → Output “Adopt as reframing tool.”

**Project/Task Notes**
IPO adds depth by testing feasibility and implications. Output turns discussions into prioritized action steps.

**Creative Notes**
Use flexibly. Processing helps filter raw ideas; Output singles out promising ones.

### 3. When to Loosen the Structure

* **Quick jot notes**: Capture only Input, add later reflection.
* **Collaborative notes**: Prioritize speed; personal Processing/Output can follow after.

### 4. IPO as Mental Habit

Even if unwritten, the sequence can guide thinking:

* Input: Active intake.
* Process: Constant questioning.
* Output: Mental synthesis and decision.

### Conclusion

Most notes gain from IPO, especially for long-term utility. Streamlined use is sufficient for fast capture or collaboration. As a general framework, it reliably transforms information into usable knowledge.
