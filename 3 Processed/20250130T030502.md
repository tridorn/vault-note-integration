# Workflow for Working with a Book in Obsidian

#### 1. Pre-Reading

* **Create Note:** Title it with the book’s name.
* **Metadata:** Title, author, publication date, genre, pre-reading thoughts.
* **Research:** Add a brief overview of themes and context.
* **Goals:** Define what you want from the book.

#### 2. Active Reading

* **Highlight/Annotate:** Mark important passages; note page numbers or write directly in Obsidian.
* **Daily Log:** Record date, progress, and short reflections.

#### 3. Note-Taking

* **Chapter Summaries:** After each chapter, add a subsection with summary, key points, themes, questions.
* **Key Takeaways:** Track broader insights spanning multiple chapters.
* **Quotes:** Collect memorable lines with page/chapter references.

#### 4. Concepts and Links

* **Flag New Concepts:** Note them in summaries for later review.
* **External Notes:** Create dedicated notes for significant concepts, link them back to the book.

#### 5. Post-Reading

* **Comprehensive Summary:** Cover main arguments, themes, and reflections.
* **Review & Synthesize:** Revisit notes, connect with other materials, create cross-links.
