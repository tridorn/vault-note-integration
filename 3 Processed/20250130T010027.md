**Cornell Note-Taking in the IPO Framework**

Cornell note-taking fits as a **pre-Input phase** in the *Input → Process → Output* system. It structures raw capture during lectures, readings, or discussions, before synthesis in Obsidian.

**Cornell Structure:**

* **Notes (Right column):** Main points and details recorded during engagement.
* **Cues (Left column):** Keywords, prompts, or questions added post-session.
* **Summary (Bottom):** Brief synthesis of the page’s content.

**Integration Flow:**

1. **Cornell Capture (Pre-Input):** Organize information in real time.
2. **Obsidian Input:** Transfer condensed insights from Cornell notes; strip redundancy.
3. **Obsidian Process:** Use Cornell cues/questions for reflection and deeper analysis.
4. **Obsidian Output:** Formulate actionable steps or applications.

**Example:**

* Cornell Notes:

  * Notes: “System 1 = fast, intuitive; System 2 = slow, deliberate.”
  * Cues: “How can System 2 be trained?”; “Heuristics.”
  * Summary: “Two modes of thinking with trade-offs in speed vs. accuracy.”
* Obsidian Input: Condensed bullet points on System 1 and 2.
* Process: Explore methods to trigger System 2 in decisions.
* Output: Add pre-decision reflection time in meetings.

**Benefits of Integration:**

* Immediate structure during capture, reducing later rework.
* Cornell cues become natural prompts for the Process phase.
* Smooth transfer into IPO with minimal restructuring.
* Encourages critical engagement and practical application.

**Conclusion:**
Cornell note-taking strengthens IPO by delivering an organized, prompt-rich starting point for synthesis and action. It prevents disorganized raw notes and accelerates movement from capture to insight.
