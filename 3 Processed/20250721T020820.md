# One-Brain, Two-Hands Ruleset (Condensed)

## 1 Source of Truth

* **YAML = canonical facts** (structured, machine-readable).
* **Body = meaning and narrative** (interpretation, context).
* Flow is **YAML → Body** only. Exception: title (and optionally summary) can flow back into YAML.

## 2 Division of Labor

| Block    | YAML holds                    | Body holds                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| core     | uid, owner, timestamps, title | Badge pulled from YAML; optional origin note |
| flow     | stage, status, project IDs    | Auto-rendered table + rationale              |
| taxonomy | tags, topics, type            | Why it was filed this way                    |
| links    | arrays of UIDs                | Wikilinks generated + relational notes       |
| content  | summary, keywords             | Actual substance                             |
| source   | bib IDs, URLs                 | Citation table + extraction notes            |
| govern   | sensitivity, license          | Compliance note                              |
| metrics  | backlinks, opened             | Interpretation                               |
| ops      | pipeline flags                | Rare commentary                              |

Rule of thumb: **YAML stores values, body stores reasoning.**

## 3 No Duplication

* Use **Dataview pulls** (tables/lists refresh automatically).
* Use **templates** that first update YAML, then re-insert snippet without overwriting narrative.

## 4 Field-by-Field

* **Title**: Edit H1; hook mirrors into YAML.
* **UID/timestamps**: generated, never touched.
* **Flow**: folder move or template updates YAML + body table.
* **Tags/links**: forms/templates update YAML → body refresh.
* **Summary**: optional body-first sync.
* **Metrics**: scripts only.
* **Ops flags**: manual YAML toggle.

## 5 Sync Mechanisms

* Pre-save hook: body → YAML (title, optional summary).
* Folder move: FS → YAML (stage).
* Block templates: user → YAML → body.
* Nightly cron: refresh metrics.
* Dataview: YAML → body live.
  No other reverse paths.

## 6 Change Scenarios

* Rename project: run template → YAML updates → body refreshes.
* Add parent concept: YAML link update → instant body wikilink.
* Confidential: flip YAML flag → badge displays.

## 7 Why YAML is Primary

* Structured, lossless export.
* Prose changes don’t break pipelines.
* Easier conflict resolution in small headers.

## 8 Body-First Exceptions

Only if needed, declare a single field (e.g. summary) as body-driven. Otherwise YAML rules.

## 9 Template Pack

* `_new-core.md`: bootstrap note.
* `blocks/flow.md`, `blocks/taxonomy.md`, `blocks/links.md`: each updates YAML + re-renders block.
* “Promote to Library” macro = flow + taxonomy + links + content.

---

**Essence:** YAML holds definitive data, body holds interpretations. Keep all pulls YAML → body, except title/summary if desired. Prevent duplication with Dataview + templates.
