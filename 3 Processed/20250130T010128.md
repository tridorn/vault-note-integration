## Core Principles

1. **Purpose-Centric**: Every step serves a defined goal.
2. **Medium-Agnostic**: Works with text, visuals, or hybrids.
3. **Scalable**: Suitable for brief notes or complex systems.
4. **Iterative**: Designed for refinement and interconnection.

## Framework Layers

### 1. Harvesting

**Purpose**: Capture raw, unfiltered information or ideas.
**Components**:

* **Sources**: External (books, lectures) or internal (brainstorming, prior notes).
* **Collection**: Gather without judgment.
* **Highlights/Observations**: Mark relevance or curiosity triggers.

**Steps**:

1. Define why you are engaging with the material.
2. Interact with the source.
3. Capture key points, quotes, questions, sketches.
4. Annotate initial reactions or questions.

**Output**: Raw input for structuring.

### 2. Structuring

**Purpose**: Organize raw material into coherent form.
**Components**:

* **Frameworks**: Choose format suited to goal (linear, mind map, flowchart, sketch notes, outline).
* **Contextualization**: Define purpose, goals, key questions.
* **Connections**: Link related ideas.
* **Summaries/Reflections**: Cohesive statements of meaning.

**Steps**:

1. Select organizational method.
2. Contextualize with purpose and key questions.
3. Group related points, arrange in framework.
4. Add reflections and highlight action points.

**Output**: Organized, contextual material ready for synthesis.

### 3. Synthesizing

**Purpose**: Distill structured material into reusable, interconnected knowledge units.
**Components**:

* **Atomic Notes**: Single-topic, self-contained.
* **Conceptualization**: Extract core idea or process.
* **Analysis**: Interpret meaning and implications.
* **Actionable Insights**: Applications or follow-up questions.

**Steps**:

1. Break structured notes into discrete concepts.
2. For each, apply Input → Process → Output:

   * **Input**: Core summary.
   * **Process**: Context and reflection.
   * **Output**: Insights or next steps.
3. Link concepts across your system.
4. Periodically review and refine.

**Output**: Interlinked knowledge network.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Harvesting** → capture raw material.
2. **Structuring** → organize and contextualize.
3. **Synthesizing** → create atomic notes and link them.

## Application Examples

* **Mind Map**: Harvest key phrases → branch into themes → synthesize as atomic notes.
* **Linear Notes**: Harvest in sequence → reorganize under headings → synthesize by topic.
* **Sketch Notes**: Capture visuals → group and annotate → extract into concept notes.
