## Operating Principles

1. Capture fast, refine later.
2. One mobile set, one home base.
3. Draft in pencil, commit in ink.
4. Color and symbols serve logic, not aesthetics.
5. Reviews are scheduled.

## Environments

**Mobile (library, café, courses):**

* Core tool: **Lamy 2000 multipen** (black main; red/blue for tags; pencil for scaffolds). Alt: **Jetstream 0.5**.
* Drafting: **Rotring 600 HB/H**.
* Commit lines/headings: **Pilot Falcon** (Iroshizuku ink).
* Micro-diagrams: **Micron 01, 03**.
* One **Mildliner** neutral tone.
* **Mono Zero** eraser.

**Home desk:**

* Full Micron set (005–08).
* Brush pens: Tombow, Pentel.
* Mildliners, ruler, templates.
* Maintenance kit: flush, syringe, cloth.
* Spare inks, leads, refills.

**Large sheets/Post-its:**

* Rotring pencil (H).
* Micron 03/05 for structure, Falcon for headings.
* Mildliners or multipen colors if mobile.

## Workflow

1. **Capture:** Fast notes in notebook, Lamy black or Jetstream. Use margin codes (“T:” task, “Q:” question).
2. **Micro-structure:** Rotring for boxes/arrows; Micron 01 if committing.
3. **Commit:** Falcon for headings, key formulas.
4. **Hierarchy:** One Mildliner color per project/day.
5. **Daily triage (10 min):** Close loops, migrate tasks, mark migrated items red or with Mildliner, pencil placeholders for tomorrow.
6. **Weekly consolidation:** Transfer refined concepts to large sheets; full Micron set, templates, brush pens. Falcon with Carbon Black only for archival pages.

## Instrument Heuristic

| Context              | Action       | Tool                       |
| -------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Cheap paper          | Capture only | Lamy black / Jetstream     |
| Small marks/diagrams | Permanent    | Micron 01/005              |
| Draft layout         | Erasable     | Rotring (H/HB)             |
| Long-term recall     | Commit       | Falcon                     |
| Priority tag         | Mark         | Lamy red/blue or Mildliner |
| Archival diagram     | Clean lines  | Micron 03/05 (or Isograph) |

## Media

* **Notebook** = inbox.
* **Post-its** = temporary reminders, cleared weekly.
* **Large sheets** = syntheses and frameworks.
* **Digital** = archive only.

## Maintenance

* Falcon: flush monthly (dye) or biweekly (Carbon Black).
* Microns: recap immediately.
* Rotring: clean lead dust monthly.
* Lamy multipen: refill check quarterly; 3 pencil leads minimum.

## Redundancy

* Spare black pen in bag.
* Backup eraser.
* Weekly phone photo of key pages.

## Rules

1. Max 5 instruments daily.
2. One color per context.
3. Pencil before ink if spatial precision matters.
4. Date important pages.
5. Rewrite anything tagged twice.

---

Outcome: mobile kit = capture and quick commit; home kit = structure and archive. Falcon reserved for emphasis, Lamy/Rotring for work, Microns for precision, Mildliners for logic signals.
