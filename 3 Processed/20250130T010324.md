# Purpose, Goals, and Key Questions

These should be filled out **together at the start** of working with material. They form a guiding unit, but should also be revisited and adjusted as understanding deepens.

### 1. Purpose

* **Role**: Anchor the note, define *why it matters* in a broader context.
* **Stability**: Usually static, since it reflects higher-level motivation.
* **Refinement**: Only if priorities shift or the material proves more significant than expected.

*Example*:

* Initial: “Understand Eisenhower Matrix basics.”
* Refined: “Explore its value for project management efficiency.”

### 2. Goals

* **Role**: Define concrete outcomes (takeaways, skills, problems solved).
* **Stability**: Frequently evolves as new insights appear.
* **Refinement**: During engagement, when new themes or challenges surface; after engagement, to convert into actionable outcomes.

*Example*:

* Initial: “Learn steps of Pomodoro Technique.”
* Refined: Add “Understand psychological effects” and “Evaluate fit for creative tasks.”

### 3. Key Questions

* **Role**: Frame attention, drive active engagement.
* **Stability**: Highly dynamic. Questions get answered, expanded, or discarded.
* **Refinement**: Add during study; after, decide which unanswered ones warrant follow-up.

*Example*:

* Initial: “What are the steps of Pomodoro Technique?”
* Refined: Add “Which tasks benefit most?” and “How to adapt for teams?”

## Lifecycle of Objectives

1. **Before Engagement**:

   * Purpose: why this note matters (stable).
   * Goals: initial outcomes.
   * Key Questions: starter inquiries.

2. **During Engagement**:

   * Purpose: rarely adjusted.
   * Goals: expand or sharpen.
   * Key Questions: continuously revised.

3. **After Engagement**:

   * Purpose: benchmark for success.
   * Goals: distill into actionable steps.
   * Key Questions: resolve, discard, or escalate.

## Practical Workflow

* **Before**: Skim material, draft all three sections.
* **During**: Refine in real time; add questions; adjust goals. Keep Purpose stable unless relevance shifts.
* **After**: Confirm Purpose fulfilled; rewrite Goals into actions; mark answered questions, flag unresolved ones.

*Workflow example*:

* Before: “Understand Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize tasks.”
* During: Add “Explore applications” and “Compare with other frameworks.”
* After: Refine Goal: “Implement Eisenhower Matrix in project planning.”

## Function of Objectives

* Prevents overload by focusing attention.
* Drives active engagement through questions.
* Serves as a review tool for evaluating outcomes and planning next steps.

## Final Recommendations

1. Fill **Purpose, Goals, Key Questions** together for cohesion.
2. Expect **Goals and Questions** to evolve dynamically; Purpose mostly stable.
3. Consult Objectives throughout as both guide and evaluation metric.
