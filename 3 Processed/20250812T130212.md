---
Identity: {slug: ""}
Intent: {purpose: ""}
Content: {summary: "", keypoints: []}
Work: {status: [open|done], next: ""}
Connections: {related: [], breadcrumbs: []}
Sources: {refs: []}
```

Evidence:
  items:
    - id: E1

# Migration Guide

* Flow → Work (tasks, states, due) + Lifecycle (stage/status/priority) + Decisions (choices, rationale)
* Taxonomy → Taxonomy (now facet-based)
* Links → Connections (in/out, breadcrumbs, related)
* Content → Content (summary, structure)
* Source → Sources (bibliography, web)
* Govern → Governance (sensitivity, license, retention)
* Metrics → Metrics (add word\_count, time\_spent)
* Ops → Operations (export, automations)
* New: Identity, Intent, Scope, Inputs, Decisions, History

---

# Naming & Dataview Tips

* snake\_case keys, arrays > comma strings
* fixed enums for status/stage
* dates as YYYY-MM-DD (timestamps with TZ)
* use facets in Taxonomy for multi-dimensional tagging

```dataview
TABLE Taxonomy.facets.topic as Topic, Lifecycle.stage as Stage
FROM "Notes"
WHERE type = "project"
```
