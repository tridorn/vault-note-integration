# Structured Knowledge Integration in Obsidian

### 1. Input Layer – Digestible, Contextual Knowledge

Condense material into essentials, aligned with your objectives. Filter actively, remove rhetoric, retain only the core message.

**Steps:**

* Capture only foundational or useful concepts.
* Use purpose-specific tags (`#book_summary`, `#lecture_notes`, `#raw_input`).
* Example: “Leaders need clarity over consensus to ensure decisions follow strategy, not group appeasement.”
* In Obsidian: Create a note titled by source/subject; include **Summary** with concise points; link to related notes.

### 2. Processing Layer – Active Interrogation

Challenge the material until you can restate it without the source.

**Steps:**

* Apply critical prompts: Why does this matter? Assumptions? Fit with existing knowledge? Simplified restatement?
* Use the Feynman Technique to identify knowledge gaps.
* Example: “Clarity avoids dilution; in AMU, set mission parameters instead of extended consensus meetings.”
* In Obsidian: Add **Analysis** with prompts as headers and bullet answers.

### 3. Output Layer – Actionable Insight

Transform processed thoughts into tools for execution.

**Steps:**

* Define concrete applications and next steps.
* Build personal frameworks or templates from recurring patterns.
* Test and record results.
* Example: “Develop AMU mission template prioritizing clarity, bypassing consensus.”
* In Obsidian: Add **Application** or **Conclusion**, link to tasks/projects.

### 4. Knowledge Ecosystem – Linking and Mapping

Avoid isolated notes; connect ideas for cross-domain application.

**Steps:**

* Create backlinks to related concepts.
* Use Graph View to spot thematic evolution.
* Example: Link leadership notes to AMU structure, culture, Stoic principles.

### 5. Periodic Recall and Reflection

Reinforce and refine understanding over time.

**Steps:**

* Revisit **Application** sections and explain without notes.
* Maintain **Reflection Notes** as evolving syntheses.
* Use spaced repetition plugins for review.

### 6. Templates – Consistency of Thought Flow

Standardize the Input → Process → Output model.

**Template Example:**

```
# Summary (Input)
# Analysis (Processing)
# Application (Output)
```

Automate insertion with Templater or QuickAdd.
