# What to Ship as Templates

## Options

**A. Mega-template**

* Pros: total uniformity, no missing blocks.
* Cons: clutter, maintenance, fatigue.
* Fit: regimented teams, not individuals.

**B. Bare-bones default**

* Pros: lean, quick to start.
* Cons: drift in naming/order; requires automation.
* Fit: good ergonomics, needs guardrails.

**C. Hybrid (preferred)**

* Core spine always present: identity, intent, sources, content, conclusions, state, links.
* Atoms added on demand: method, findings, next, ledger.
* Type overlays: pre-compose likely atoms (e.g. Project adds method, findings, next).
* Verdict: balances universality, clarity, and scalability.

## Implementation

**1. Three layers of templates**

* Spine template: YAML + matching H2s.
* Atomic snippets: idempotent, add YAML + H2 if missing.
* Overlays: spine + fixed atom set.

**2. Enforce dual contract**

* Naming parity between YAML and H2.
* Idempotence: add only if missing.
* Mirroring: compact Dataview at each H2 top.
* Single truth: YAML stores facts; body holds prose.

**3. Suggested spine (YAML)**
identity, intent, sources, content, conclusions, state, links.
Each with minimal but extensible fields (id, title, purpose, outcomes, items\[], claims, stage, status, tags, dependencies).

**4. Sample atomic blocks**

* Method: approach, steps, tools, when.
* Findings: statements, quotes, metrics.
* Next: single action, owner, due; backlog for extras.

**5. Type overlays**

* Project: type=project, stage=clarify, atoms=method, findings, next, ledger.
* Book: type=book, atoms=findings.
* Paper: type=paper, atoms=method, findings.

**6. Guardrails**

* Fixed order of spine; standard atom order.
* One “next” action only.
* Update stamp on edits.
* Validation dashboard: missing blocks, empty content, outdated notes.

**7. Rule of thumb**

* Hate empty sections → Hybrid + atoms.
* Team/shared vault → Mega or Hybrid with required overlays.
* Speed first → Bare-bones + solid spine.

**8. Migration**

* Batch add spine.
* Map old fields.
* Add atoms selectively.
* Build validation dashboard.

**Bottom line**: Ship the Hybrid. One spine, modular atoms, overlays to pre-compose. Keep schema unified, idempotent, and queryable.
