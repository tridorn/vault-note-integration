# References in Note-Taking System

## Core Principles

* **Always cite**: Record sources immediately when noting external information.
* **Inline citations**: Use superscript or bracketed numbers linking to references.
* **Reference section**: Collect full citations consistently in one style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.).
* **Separate voices**: Distinguish clearly between borrowed material and original thought.
* **Consistency**: Adopt and maintain one referencing style.

## Practical Workflow

* Create **templates** in Obsidian with sections for quotes, references, and personal notes to enforce uniformity and save time.
