# Core principles

1. Single control plane. Workbook routes thinking; never the archive.
2. Single canonical store. Markdown is the durable record and link graph.
3. Analog for cognition, digital for retrieval.
4. Stable IDs across all media. Link by ID, not titles.
5. Bias to action. Notes must drive decisions, experiments, deliverables.

# Components and roles

* Workbook. Daily ledger and router with thread grammar and IDs.
* Index cards. Atomic captures. One idea per card.
* Whiteboards/post-its. Temporary synthesis. Photograph, treat as sources.
* Markdown vault. Canonical notes, decisions, experiments, maps, projects.
* Task manager and calendar. Execution only.
* Project repos. Where work ships; link back via IDs.

# IDs and linking

* Short ID on paper: YYDOY-SS. Example: 25227-03.
* Full ID in markdown: YYYY-MM-DDThhmm-type-slug. Example: 2025-08-15T0934-dec-pricing-fence.
* Link in markdown: \[\[full-id]]. In workbook: short ID + thread code.

# Workbook grammar

Thread header

```
[CODE] YYDOY-SS  Title, 3–7 words
```

Codes: WIP, DEC, EXP, Q, TASK, REF, MTG, LOG, IDEA.
Thread body: Context. Signal. Implication. Next. One sentence each.

Example

```
[DEC] 25227-03  Positioning fence v0
Context: Enterprise balks at bundle; SMBs accept.
Signal: 4/7 enterprise calls asked modularity; SMB CTR +38% on bundle.
Implication: Enterprise fence, keep SMB bundle.
Next: Create decision record; test two fences; link EXP 25227-04.
```

Daily sweep

* Convert DEC to decision record; EXP to spec/result; REF to source notes.
* Push TASK to task manager with short ID in title.
* Write new full IDs in workbook margins for traceability.

# Index cards

Layout

* Front: Title. Statement. Evidence. Implication.
* Back: Short ID, Type, Source locator, Tags, Links, Next.

Edge coding

* Top-right dot: Principle. Top-left slash: Pattern. Bottom-right square: Metric. Bottom-left triangle: Question. Right-edge notch: Action present.

Flow

* Capture anywhere.
* Photograph nightly into /\_inbox.
* During sweep, encode only high-signal cards. Assign full IDs, link to maps/projects.
* Use a 5-slot Leitner box for rehearsal of few cards.

Statement: Customers reveal WTP via fenced offers before packaging is final.
Evidence: n=8 interviews show three WTP clusters.
Implication: Ship two packages separating urgency without discounting.
Action: Landing test with two fences. Targets: CTR ≥ 2.5%, qualified replies ≥ 10%.

Context: Enterprise requests modularity; SMB converts on bundle.
Options: A single bundle; B enterprise fence; C a-la-carte.
Criteria: GM ≥ 70%, CAC payback ≤ 4 months, setup time neutral.
Decision: B enterprise fence, retain SMB bundle.
Risks: Positioning confusion; sales complexity.
Mitigations: Segment narratives; document fences in playbook.

# Workflows

Daily 30–45 min

* Start with one WIP thread defining focus.
* Capture with short IDs.
* Single sweep converts DEC, EXP, REF, pushes TASK, imports photos to /\_inbox.
* Write full IDs back in workbook margins.

Weekly 60 min

* Merge duplicates. Update maps with five links.
* Review decisions due; reverse if metrics miss.
* Cull: delete two weak notes. Archive stale experiments.

Monthly 45 min

* Audit metrics. Tighten closed tag list.
* Promote “applied” notes that drove outcomes.

# Operating constraints

* Max 12 workbook threads per day.
* Max 10 kept notes per chapter or per hour of source.
* Encode latency under 48 hours; older returns to /\_inbox for deletion.
* For every 5 notes, schedule one experiment or play.
* Quotes under 10%. Paraphrase for cognition.

# Metrics

* Encode latency. Median hours from thread to artifact. Target < 24.
* Action ratio. Plays executed / created. Target ≥ 60%.
* Retrieval time. Find 3 relevant notes for a live decision. Target < 2 minutes.
* Decision follow-up. Reviews logged on time. Target ≥ 90%.
* Vault bloat. Notes untouched in 60 days. Target 20–40%.
* Card loss rate. Captured but missing at sweep. Target < 2%.

# Failure modes and fixes

* Workbook becomes diary. Fix: enforce daily cap; each thread must route to decision, experiment, note, or task.
* Fragmentation across media. Fix: stable IDs and daily sweep.
* Tag sprawl. Fix: closed vocabulary in /maps/\_tags.md; prefer explicit links.
* Scanning drag. Fix: photograph; no beautifying; type only high-signal.
* Decision amnesia. Fix: ADR-like records with review dates.

# Minimal kit

Existing workbook, pocket sleeve with 20 blanks and 10 active cards, fast-drying pen, slip box with five Leitner slots, plain-text editor, Git repo for vault, phone shortcut to save photos to /\_inbox with timestamp filenames.

# Three-day implementation

Day 1. Create folders and templates. Add closed tag list. Use thread grammar.
Day 2. First sweep. Produce one decision, one experiment, three atomic notes, one map update.
Day 3. Run the experiment. Log outcomes. Review metrics.
