# Condensed brief: mobile index cards + markdown vault

## Rationale and trade-offs

Index cards win for capture and recombination: atomicity, instant resequencing, field durability. Costs: fragmentation, scanning overhead, loss. Countermeasures: strict IDs, daily digitisation sweep, hard carry cap.

## Operating model

Objective: analogue for cognition, digital for retrieval. One pipeline, two surfaces.

1. Capture on cards. One idea per card.
2. Same-day distillation: statement, evidence, implication.
3. Encode to markdown with stable IDs and links.
4. Review via simple Leitner box.
5. Reuse by pulling notes into projects and maps.

## Card taxonomy (minimal, action-biased)

Claim; Principle; Pattern; Metric; Play; Counterexample; Question; Quote (only if wording matters).

## Card layout

Front: Title (3–6 words). Statement. Evidence. Implication.
Back: ID YYDOY-SS. Type. Source + locator. Tags (2–4 controlled). Links. Status (inbox | distilled | encoded | applied). Next: action, owner, date.
Example ID: 25227-03; expand to full timestamp during encoding.

## Edge coding (fast triage)

Top-right dot = Principle. Top-left slash = Pattern. Bottom-right square = Metric. Bottom-left triangle = Question. Right-edge notch = “Action present”. No colours.

## Physical workflow

Slip box with three compartments: Inbox; Active; Review (Leitner slots 1–5).
Daily carry: pocket sleeve with 20 blanks + 10 active, pen, binder clip. Hard cap: 30 cards.

## Encoding and vault

Single namespace; linkable; grep-friendly.

## Review cadence (Leitner, decision-weighted)

Slot 1 daily; Slot 2 every 3 days; Slot 3 weekly; Slot 4 bi-weekly; Slot 5 monthly.
Enter at Slot 1. Correct recall or confirmed use → next slot. Failure or irrelevance → Slot 1 or archive. Cap “rehearsing” at 20 notes; if no action in 2 months, demote.

## Reading protocol (two books per week)

Day 1 capture: 30–60 cards across both; mark types; minimum two “Play” cards per chapter.
Day 2 distil: select 10 cards per book; write statement/evidence/implication; encode; link each to one project or map.
Day 3 apply: execute one Play per book; record outcomes; move applied cards to Slot 2.
Half-day synthesis: update each source dossier with \~200-word synthesis and three map links; cull three weak notes per book.

## Operating constraints (keep it sharp)

Hard caps: ≤10 kept notes per chapter or per hour of audio.
For every 5 notes created, 1 Play must be scheduled in a real project.
Quote density <10%; paraphrase by default.
If a card isn’t encoded within 72 hours, return to Inbox and consider deletion.
Weekly merge pass: dedupe, keep stronger evidence chain, update redirects.

## Integration rules

Closed tag list in /maps/\_tags.md. Use few, durable terms: strategy, pricing, segmentation, pmf, growth, experiment, analytics, ux, sales, negotiation, research, moat, ops. Prefer links over tags. Projects pull by links, not copy.

## Metrics to audit

Capture selectivity = kept / captured. Target ≤30%.
Encode latency = median hours creation→markdown. Target <48.
Action ratio = Plays executed / Plays created. Target ≥60%.
Retrieval speed = time to find three relevant notes for a live decision. Target <2 minutes.
Archive rate = percent untouched in 60 days. Target 20–40%.

## Failure modes and fixes

Card loss → daily photo sweep to \_inbox; pocket sleeve; visible “cards carried” count.
Fragmentation → weekly merge; strict linking into maps.
Over-capture → enforce caps; routine cull.
Scanning drag → photo first; type only top notes.
Tag sprawl → closed vocabulary; links first.

## Minimal kit

Cards: 3×5 or A6, 180–220 gsm, dot grid.
Sleeve: slim, 30-card capacity.
Pen: fast-dry 0.5–0.7 gel or fine felt.
Slip box: five-slot Leitner or three-slot divider.
Stickers: weekly IDs PF-01 to PF-30; write full timestamp at encoding.
