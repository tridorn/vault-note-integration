Better phrased: _‚ÄúCondense this blueprint into a shorter, non-bloated version while retaining its essential architecture and distinctive tips.‚Äù_

Here is a reduced version, keeping structural clarity, unique practices, and actionable rules while cutting repetition and decorative phrasing:

---

# Note Blueprint

> **UID:** uid | **Stage:** life.stage | **Status:** life.status  
> **Summary:** one-sentence pitch (‚â§ 20 words)

---

## 1 Purpose üîé

‚â§ 2 sentences why this note exists.

## 2 Core üìÑ

Single atomic idea, concept, or task. Use short prose, lists, or code blocks.

## 3 Context üåê

- Up (parents)
    
- Across (related)
    
- Down (children, examples)
    

## 4 Action ‚úÖ

-  Task 1
    
-  Task 2
    

## 5 Sources üîó

1. Author, _Work_ (Year)
    
2. DOI or link
    

## 6 Revision üõ†

| Rev | Date | Change |

---

## Archetypes

- **Capture**: Title, Purpose, Core only.
    
- **Task**: Purpose + Action as main body.
    
- **Project Index**: Full shell; Context expanded with Dataview queries.
    
- **Evergreen**: All sections; 100‚Äì400 words.
    
- **Meeting**: Agenda, notes, decisions; Action with due dates; Sources = meeting record.

## Formatting

|Element|Rule|
|---|---|
|Headings|Numeric (`## 1`, `## 2` ‚Ä¶).|
|Links|By UID (`[[20250720132541]]`).|
|Callouts|`> [!tip]` or `> [!warning]`, max 3.|
|Tasks|Only in Action section.|
|Code|Triple-backticks, with language tag.|

---

## Size & Atomicity

|Type|Target|
|---|---|
|Capture ‚â§150 words|Evergreen 100‚Äì400|

If oversized, split into sub-notes in `50_Build/` or `80_Library/`.

---

## Automation Hooks

1. **New Note**: Insert shell with metadata.
    
2. **Save Hook**: Update metadata; warn if Purpose/Core missing.
    
3. **Promote**: Stage=library requires Summary + Context.
    
4. **Audit**: Weekly flag notes with no inbound links.
    

---

## Evolution

- Add new sections sequentially (`## 7` ‚Ä¶).
    
- Add new archetypes by cloning the shell into `00_System/Templates/`.
    

---

**Essence:** One skeleton, six sections. Archetypes pre-fill or hide parts. Predictable parsing, graph-aware, automation-ready.

Would you like me to now process your other scattered notes against this compressed blueprint and integrate overlaps, or do you want this stage frozen as the ‚Äúcanonical core‚Äù first?
