# Assessment: Breadcrumbs in Lifecycle-Driven Vault

## 1. Core Value vs. Native Obsidian

* Adds directional hierarchies (parent, child, sibling, prev/next).
* Supports multiple concurrent hierarchies.
* Auto-generates ancestry paths and sequence navigation.
* Provides ordered navigation panes, ontology checks, and visual trails.
* Distinct value lies in building and navigating **ontologies** (concept → principle → method), not lifecycle flow.

## 2. Fit With Current System

* Lifecycle stages: no benefit; risk of duplicate “status” signals.
* YAML schema already provides controlled vocab; Breadcrumbs would add curation overhead.
* Best applied in **Library** (conceptual knowledge).
* Costs: consistent parent/child assignment, audits, metadata churn in Git.

## 3. Adoption Criteria

Adopt if:

* Library exceeds \~100 evergreen notes.
* You routinely ask “Where does this belong?” or need structured traversal.
* Concepts require multiple parents.
* You plan structured outputs (courses, books).

Postpone if:

* Search/tags/backlinks work well.
* Library small (<100 notes).
* Lifecycle system still stabilizing.

## 4. Deployment Patterns

* **Pattern A – Library-Only Ontology (minimal):**

  * Scope: `08_Library/`.
  * Relations: `broader`, `derivedFrom`, `related`.
  * Rules: max 2 broader parents, no lifecycle mixing, monthly orphan audit.

* **Pattern B – Dual-Axis (higher overhead):**

  * Taxonomy (`broader`) + sequences (`prev/next`).
  * Useful for course-like outputs; requires discipline in maintenance.

## 5. Storage Choice

* Keep relationships in nested YAML `relations:` block.
* Avoid mixing with tags or body content.
* Use stable UIDs, cap parents, run integrity checks.

## 6. Guardrails

* Prevent “hierarchy creep”:

  * Max 2 broader parents.
  * Quarterly orphan/invalid edge audits.
  * Remove unused relations after 90 days.

## 7. Decision Matrix

* <100 notes, low navigation pain → Skip.
* 100–200 notes, recurring navigation friction → Adopt Pattern A.
* Curriculum or structured learning output → Pattern B.

## 8. Final Recommendation

Do **not** adopt yet. Trigger: adopt when Library ≥120 evergreen notes **and** ≥3 navigation failures per month. Confine use to Library, Pattern A, with strict rules. Document trigger in `00_System/Workflows/ontology-adoption.md`.
