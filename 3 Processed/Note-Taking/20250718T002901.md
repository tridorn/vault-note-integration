# Lifecycle-driven vault scaffold

Eight active stages, each folder answers *“What is happening to the note right now?”* One job per folder.

### Flow overview

| #             | Folder                                             | Function |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `00_System/`  | Templates, snippets, media, logs—never content.    |          |
| `01_Capture/` | Raw inflow. Clear daily.                           |          |
| `02_Triage/`  | Clarify in ≤2 min, route or discard.               |          |
| `03_Nurture/` | Uncommitted ideas worth revisiting. Weekly check.  |          |
| `04_Plan/`    | Committed actions, scoped projects, schedules.     |          |
| `05_Work/`    | Active drafts, research, prototyping.              |          |
| `06_Deliver/` | Finalized artifacts, published or handed off.      |          |
| `07_Learn/`   | Journals, reviews, retros, insights.               |          |
| `08_Library/` | Evergreen knowledge: concepts, methods, resources. |          |
| `98_Archive/` | Cold storage >1 year, keeps set lean.              |          |

### Key distinctions

* `Capture` vs. `Triage`: raw vs. clarified. Nothing lingers in Capture.
* `Nurture`: holds only *possibilities*. Anything scheduled moves to Plan.
* `Plan` vs. `Work`: scope and next steps vs. evolving drafts.
* `Deliver` vs. `Library`: final project outputs vs. distilled, reusable knowledge.
* `Learn`: sense-making that may or may not promote to Library.
* `Archive`: for obsolete or finished material; prevents clutter.

### Operating rhythm

1. Capture fast into `01_Capture/`.
2. Triage daily: act, delegate, defer, nurture, or delete.
3. Review `03_Nurture/` weekly, promote ripe ideas.
4. Prune quarterly, archive stale projects and empty folders.
