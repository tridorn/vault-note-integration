**Condensed version**

**1. Alignment**

* Place the *goal* in the top-left, aligned with the cue column. This keeps objectives visible during reflection.
* Place *questions* in the top-right, aligned with the main notes column, tying queries directly to content capture.
* This structure maintains visual balance and supports review efficiency.

**2. Labels vs. no labels**

* **With labels** (“Title:”, “Goal:”, “Questions:”) – clearer, more consistent, better for professional or multi-topic notes.
* **Without labels** – cleaner, faster, fine for personal or informal notes if structure is obvious from placement.

**Recommendation**
Default to labels for clarity and cross-session consistency; omit only when speed or minimalism is the priority.

**3. Example layout**

Title: Time Management
Goal: Understand time allocation techniques       Questions:
                                                 - How to prioritize tasks?
                                                 - What are distraction techniques?

Cue:                                             Main Notes:
- Pomodoro technique                             - 25-min focus blocks + breaks
- Eisenhower matrix                              - Matrix separates urgent vs. important

Summary: Pomodoro not ideal for all tasks; matrix works well for prioritization.
