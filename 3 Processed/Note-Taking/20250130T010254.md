# Knowledge Network of IPO Notes (Condensed)

### Structure

A modular, hierarchical system of **nodes** (atomic conceptual notes) grouped into **domains**. Interconnections capture logical, thematic, or dependency relationships.

### Domains

**1. Foundations**

* **Definition & Purpose**: Structured recording and organizing of information to enable understanding, retention, application.
* **Phases**: Harvesting, Structuring, Synthesizing.
* **Core Principles**: Purpose-driven, medium-agnostic, scalable, iterative.
* **Objectives**: Purpose, Goals, Key Questions.

**2. Harvesting Layer**

* Gathering raw input from sources (books, lectures, brainstorming).
* Steps: Source Identification, Raw Extraction, Theme Identification.
* Output: A pool of raw material grouped into themes.

**3. Structuring Layer**

* Organizing raw input into coherent forms.
* Frameworks: Mind Mapping, Outlines, Linear Notes, Flowcharts, Sketch Notes.
* Enhancements: Contextualization (Purpose/Goals/Questions), Note Framing, Initial Reflections, Summarization.
* Output: Structured material ready for synthesis.

**4. Synthesizing Layer**

* Transforming structured notes into **atomic notes** (single-topic, reusable).
* Framework: Input → Process → Output.
* Techniques: Atomic Breakdown, Interlinking Concepts.
* Output: Actionable knowledge blocks.

**5. Knowledge Network**

* Interconnected atomic notes forming a reusable system.
* **Vertical links**: Across phases.
* **Horizontal links**: Between related concepts (e.g. Pomodoro ↔ Deep Work).
* Iterative Growth: Add new notes, refine existing ones, integrate across topics.
