**Objective**
Paper system acting as half-hour working memory: free-flowing but constrained by invariants for retrieval, migration, and audit.

**Core invariants**

1. Every line timestamped.
2. Every line type-marked.
3. Tasks migrated same day.
4. Cross-reference anything to revisit.
5. Daily 7-minute sweep.

**Page anatomy**

* Header: YYYY-MM-DD · Day code · location.
* Left gutter 1.5 cm: time + status ticks.
* Body: free writing.
* Right gutter 1 cm: links + thread IDs.
* Footer: page no. + book code.

**Markers**
A action now.
t task to migrate.
d decision.
n neutral note.
q question.
r risk/constraint.
w waiting.
↻ revisit.
⊕ idea to index.

Lifecycle ticks: □ open, ✓ done, → migrated (specify system), ✖ dropped (reason).

**Notation**
Time format: 09:00 or 09:00–09:30.
Thread format: \[P\:FOO], \[T\:TOPIC].
One thought per line.

**Color/tools discipline**

* Fountain pen: body.
* Micron 01: timestamps, markers, links.
* Micron 005: edits.
* One Midliner color per quarter, for d, r, ⊕.
* Pencil for sketches, ink only after validation.

**Daily protocol**
Morning: header + 3 outcome d-lines (“O1…O3”).
Day: new timestamp each half-hour, capture tasks immediately as t-lines.
Evening sweep: migrate all t, close A, circle d with Midliner, link pages, index 2–3 ⊕.

**Weekly cadence**
Open Week Ledger: list r, top 3 d, debts (t/w >5 days).
Friday: one n-paragraph “State of Play.”

**Threading/cross-refs**
Continuation: “→p187 \[P\:FOO]” and backlink.
Summaries: write converged d-line, mark ⊕.
Mark top-outer corner of pages with d or r.

**Migration rules**

* Tasks: leave same day; if blocked, log why + ↻ with time.
* Calendar: “cal: YYYY-MM-DD hh\:mm,” migrate in sweep.
* Waiting: must name owner + next event; review weekly.

**Retrieval**

* Continuous page numbers.
* Back-of-book alphabetized index by thread, pages only.
* Monthly capture: photo/scan only pages with Midliner marks; full scans only if compliance requires.

**Decision hygiene**

* d-lines: complete sentence + rationale.
* Reversal: new d supersedes old, link both.

**Constraints**
One header per page/day.
One Midliner color per quarter.
No sticky notes.
No mixed markers in a line.
