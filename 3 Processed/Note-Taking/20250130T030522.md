# System for Annotating and Highlighting Texts

**1. Initial Reading**
Skim headings, summaries, and key arguments to form an overview.

**2. Color-Coded Highlighting**
Assign each hue a function:

* Yellow: main ideas
* Blue: evidence/data
* Green: personal insights
* Pink: questions
* Orange: contradictions

**3. Marginal Notes**
Keep concise, purposeful annotations:

* Summarize arguments in shorthand
* Pose questions or challenges
* Cross-reference related texts
* Note personal reactions

**4. Symbols for Speed**
Standard marks for quick recognition:

* * (crucial)
* ! (provocative)
* ? (unclear, needs follow-up)
* â†’ (expanded elsewhere)

**5. Centralized Index**
Maintain a ledger of notes with page numbers, categorized by theme. Add concise summaries of sections.

**6. Reflective Summaries**
After each chapter/section, write a synthesis: integrate key points, assess argument strength, note personal implications.

**Guidelines**

* Consistency: same system across texts
* Selectivity: avoid over-annotation
* Adaptability: adjust categories for genre or purpose
* Review: revisit notes for retention and connection-building
