# Core Proposal: YAML–H2 System for Obsidian Notes

**Principle:** Each YAML top-level key matches an H2 section in the note body. System should be universal, queryable, and extensible.

### Blocks

1. **Identity**
   Defines what the note is.

* title, type (concept, project, reference, log), aliases, id/UUID

2. **Context**
   Position in larger structure.

* parent, children, tags, domain, related

3. **Workflow**
   State and progress.

* stage (idea, draft, active, complete, archived)
* status (blocked, review, urgent), priority, due, owner

4. **Content**
   The main substance.

* summary, key\_points, details (body text), questions

5. **Evidence**
   References and material.

* sources, quotes, attachments, media

6. **Governance**
   Rules and constraints.

* sensitivity (public/internal/confidential), license, retention

7. **Metrics**
   Quantitative tracking.

* created, last\_modified, last\_opened, access\_count, effort\_logged, completion\_%

8. **Operations**
   Executable actions.

* export\_formats, automation (scripts, triggers), sync\_targets

### Advantages

* Ordered flow: Identity → Context → Workflow → Content → Evidence → Governance → Metrics → Ops mirrors the information lifecycle.
* Generalizable: Functions for projects, evergreen notes, research logs, meeting minutes.
* Extensible: Each block can absorb future fields.
* Query-ready: Aligns with Obsidian Dataview.
* Consistency: YAML keys = H2 sections for seamless body–metadata mapping.

### Migration Path

Old schema (Flow, Taxonomy, Links, Content, Source, Govern, Metrics, Ops) roughly maps to new blocks. Re-mapping avoids confusion and enables painless upgrade.
