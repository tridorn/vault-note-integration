# Core Principles

1. **Separation of capture and curation**: Handwritten for comprehension; digital for structured, searchable data.
2. **One-way migration**: Analogue → digital, forcing synthesis and compression.
3. **Minimum viable digitisation**: Focus on indexing and reuse, not transcription.
4. **Atomicity**: Each idea stands alone in Markdown, linkable and recombinable.
5. **Search over fidelity**: Keywords, tags, and summaries outweigh completeness.

## Process

**1. Analogue capture while reading**

* Dedicated notebook or index cards.
* Two colours: content vs. synthesis/questions.
* Use symbols: @ (experiments), \$ (monetisation), ? (uncertainty).
* Always rephrase, avoid copying.

**2. Rapid analogue review**

* After finishing, mark 20–30% high-leverage ideas.
* Cluster on cards or flag in notebook.

**3. Digital migration to Markdown**

* File per book: `YYYY-MM-DD_Title_Author.md`.
* Template:

  * Core thesis (1 paragraph)
  * 3–5 takeaways
  * Key concepts (with implications and action potential)
  * Short quotes (if high-utility)
  * Actions/experiments
  * Tags (#domain, #stage)
* Atomic concepts get separate files in `/concepts/`, linked back to book.

**4. Weekly consolidation**

* Link related concepts across files.
* Maintain thematic index files manually (e.g., Pricing Strategies.md).

## Tooling

* **Analogue**: A5 dot-grid notebook + 3×5 cards.
* **Digital**: Folder-based Markdown app (Obsidian optional).
* **Archival**: Store snapshots of annotated pages in `/raw_notes/`, no OCR.

## Trade-offs

* Digital record distilled, not exhaustive.
* Migration bottleneck: \~30–60 min per book.
* Skipping analogue review produces noise.
