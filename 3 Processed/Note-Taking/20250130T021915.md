**Color-coding system for annotating texts**

1. **Yellow**: Mark core assertions, theses, and structural signposts (headings, subheadings, pivotal statements).
2. **Green**: Highlight definitions and key terms to create an internal glossary.
3. **Blue**: Use for empirical data, statistics, dates, or factual anchors.
4. **Pink**: Apply to interpretive insights, critiques, and personal reflections.
5. **Purple**: Reserve for questions, ambiguities, and points of disagreement requiring further inquiry.

Purpose: Segment text into functional categories, simplify review, and enhance engagement.
