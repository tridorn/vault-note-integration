# The unified primitives (12 blocks)

A single, dual-purpose note model usable for projects, research, book notes. Works equally for static notes and action notes.
Two layers per block:

* **Meta (YAML):** machine-readable facts.
* **Body (H2):** human narrative. Dataview can mirror meta but prose stays here.

## The 12 blocks

1. **identity** – what this is
2. **intent** – why it exists / goal / question
3. **sources** – bibliographic references
4. **inputs** – datasets, prompts, requirements, assets
5. **method** – approach/steps/tools/time
6. **content** – summary, draft, analysis, design
7. **findings** – highlights, results, measurements
8. **conclusions** – claims, decisions, takeaways
9. **next** – follow-ups, tasks, open questions
10. **state** – lifecycle/status/tags/project
11. **ledger** – time-ordered changes, audit log
12. **links** – parent, children, dependencies, related

## Adaptability across note types

| Block       | Book note           | Research article        | Project/experiment      |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| identity    | book entry          | paper entry             | project/experiment      |
| intent      | why read; questions | research questions      | goal / outcome          |
| sources     | book refs           | bibliography            | standards/specs         |
| inputs      | outline, list       | datasets, code          | requirements, assets    |
| method      | reading strategy    | methods/analysis plan   | plan/approach           |
| content     | summary             | analysis/summary        | draft/design            |
| findings    | quotes/highlights   | results/observations    | measurements            |
| conclusions | takeaways           | interpretation/claims   | decision/recommendation |
| next        | related reads       | replications/follow-ups | next tasks/handoff      |
| state       | done; tags          | review/done             | tracked with work stage |
| ledger      | revisions           | versioned notes         | run logs/iterations     |
| links       | themes/series       | related studies         | dependencies/risks      |

No separate templates: blocks adapt polymorphically.

## Canonical meta schema (YAML excerpt)

```yaml
identity: {id, title, type, owner}
intent: {purpose, questions, outcome}
sources: {items: [{id,title,author,year,doi|isbn,url}]}
inputs: {datasets, requirements, prompts, assets}
method: {approach, steps, tools, when}
content: {mode, template}
findings: {statements, quotes, artifacts, metrics}
conclusions: {claims, decision, rationale}
next: {action, owner, due, backlog}
state: {stage, status, project, tags, priority, created, updated}
ledger: {entries: [{ts,event,who,note}]}
links: {parent, children, depends_on, related}
```

---

## Body blocks (H2)

identity • intent • sources • inputs • method • content • findings • conclusions • next • state • ledger • links

Each carries prose interpretation; meta only stores structured data.

---

## Why this works

* Universality: every artifact has identity, purpose, materials, method, body, evidence, conclusions, future stance, governance, and connections.
* Separation of concerns: bibliographic sources vs. other inputs.
* Dual-purpose clarity: facts in meta; meaning in body.
* Static-friendly: method/next/state/ledger optional.
* Action-ready: same fields support governance when needed.
* Queryable: structured meta enables dashboards/lists.
