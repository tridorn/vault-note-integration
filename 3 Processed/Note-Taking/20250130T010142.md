**Distinction Between Skimming and Full Reading in Note-Taking**

**1. Input Phase: Skimming, Scanning, Mapping**

* **Purpose**: Triage. Identify relevant sections and set a reading plan.
* **Actions**:

  * Skim headings, summaries, visuals, key terms.
  * Annotate lightly; mark priority areas.
  * Map structure and note initial questions.
* **Output**: Prioritized reading map, initial observations.

**2. Processing Phase: Full Reading & Structured Notes**

* **Purpose**: Deep engagement and organized capture of insights.
* **Actions**:

  * Fully read prioritized sections; skip irrelevant ones.
  * Take structured notes (e.g., Cornell): main points, reflections, keywords.
  * Refine goals/questions as new insights emerge.
* **Output**: Comprehensive, organized notes aligned to objectives.

**3. Synthesis Phase: Atomic Notes**

* **Purpose**: Refine into reusable, standalone concepts.
* **Actions**:

  * Extract discrete ideas from structured notes.
  * Apply Input → Process → Output for each.
  * Link related concepts, identify gaps.
* **Output**: Interlinked conceptual notes.

**When to Fully Read vs. Skim**

* **Input Phase**: Skim to decide relevance.
* **Processing Phase**: Fully read prioritized content while taking structured notes.
* **Synthesis Phase**: No rereading; work from existing notes.

**Why This Workflow Works**

* **Efficiency**: Prevents wasting time on irrelevant sections.
* **Depth**: Ensures critical content is read thoroughly.
* **Synthesis**: Produces high-quality, interconnected knowledge.
