## Objective

Extract principles and executable plays. Book = raw material. Outputs = atomic notes, one decision, one micro-experiment, links into maps.

## Protocol (3.5 days per book)

## Pre-commit triage (15–20 min)

* Scan TOC, index, intro, conclusion, 2 random pages.
* REF thread sets context and kill criteria.
* Kill rule: abort at 20% if no 2 strong cards with immediate plays.

## Day 1 – Surface capture (2–3h read, 30–45m sweep)

* Open WIP thread with focus + kill rule.
* Capture 30–60 cards, one idea per card, max 10 per chapter.
* Kill early if weak. DEC thread logs stop.
* End sweep: photo cards, promote 8–12 best.

## Day 2 AM – Distil (60–90m)

* Select top 10 cards.
* Write atomic notes: statement, evidence, implication, action.
* Link each to 1 map + 1 project; demote if not linkable.

## Day 2 PM – Synthesis (45–60m)

* Source dossier: 150–200 words, high-signal pages, links.
* Workbook threads for decisions or experiments.
* Push tasks to manager with IDs.

## Day 3 – Application (90–120m)

* Select 1 play/experiment.
* File with hypothesis, metrics, guardrails, design, sample.
* Execute minimal version same day; log outcomes (LOG thread).

## Buffer – Close (30–45m)

* 200-word synthesis: strengths, gaps, reuse cases.
* Cull 3 weak notes; merge duplicates.
* Move 1–2 to Leitner review.
* Set 30-day decision review.

# Capture rules

Keep if 2 of 3:

* Changes near-term decision.
* Specifies testable behavior/metric.
* Contradicts prior principle.
  Ignore generic exhortations, fluff stories, redundant definitions.

# Workbook grammar

* REF: start book, kill rule.
* DEC: commit or abort.
* EXP: instantiate test/play.
* TASK: push execution.
* LOG: record measurable outcomes.

# Genre emphasis

* Handbooks: capture plays, metrics; skip narrative.
* Theory: principles, counterexamples; delay plays.
* Cases: patterns, risks; synthesize into principles.
* Academic: metrics, definitions, boundaries; precise locators.

# Decision gates

* Gate 1 (20%): 2 cards → continue.
* Gate 2 (Day 2 AM): exactly 10 notes.
* Gate 3 (Day 3): no experiment/decision → mark reference only.

# Metrics

* Capture selectivity: keep ≤30%.
* Encode latency: note within 48h.
* Action ratio: ≥60% plays executed.
* Retrieval: 3 notes <2m.

# Kit & friction controls

* A6 dot-grid cards, max 30 carried.
* 0.5–0.7 fast-dry pen.
* Phone shortcut → /\_inbox.
* Pre-saved templates.
* Weekly merge pass.

# Failure modes & fixes

* Over-annotation → enforce caps, kill early.
* Drift to summarising → each note needs action.
* Fragmentation → stable IDs + daily sweep.
* Decision amnesia → ADR-style logs with review dates.

# One-page checklist

1. Triage + REF + kill rule.
2. Capture 30–60 cards; photo end of day.
3. Distil 10 atomic notes; link.
4. One experiment/play; execute.
5. Source dossier 200w.
6. Cull 3 notes; add 1–2 to Leitner.
7. Log outcomes; set review dates.
