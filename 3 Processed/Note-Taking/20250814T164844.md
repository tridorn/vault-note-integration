**Cards advantages**

* Atomic: one idea per unit, avoids clutter.
* Sortable: easy reordering, clustering, removal.
* Durable: stiffer, pocketable.
* Modular: multiple sizes/colors without method change.
* Repurposable: capture, prompt, or display.

**Bound paper disadvantages**

* Non-atomic: multiple ideas per page.
* Destructive: extraction requires rewriting.
* Fixed order: sequential inertia blocks re-clustering.

**Trade-offs**

* Bulkier, but manageable by culling.
* Loss risk, mitigated via digitisation.
* Slightly higher unit cost, offset by selectivity.

## 2. Structured system

**Physical**

* Sizes: A6 main, A7 temporary.
* Material: 200gsm+, blank front, dot-grid back.
* Optional color code: white (sources), yellow (own concepts), blue (experiments), pink (questions).

**Metadata**

* ID top-right: `YYMMDD-HHMM-TAG`.
* Bottom-left: source code.
* Bottom-right: short tags.

**Card types**
Claim, Principle, Pattern, Metric, Play, Counterexample, Question, Quote.

**Usage**

* Front: concise idea.
* Back: evidence, context, sketches.

## 3. Workflow

**Daily**

* Capture: one idea per card, assign ID.
* Staging: daily stack.
* Distil: refine, classify, add metadata.
* Link: cross-reference IDs.
* Digitise: photo/scan into inbox.

**Weekly**

* Select ≤30% for markdown transcription.
* Update project files/maps.
* File cards in boxes with dividers.

**Review cadence**

* Daily distil.
* Weekly integrate + cull.
* Monthly sample 10–15 for relevance.
* Quarterly re-cluster, archive inactive.

## 4. Practices

* Mobile kit: wallet + pen.
* Wallboard: active cards for workflow.
* Map cards: list 5–10 related IDs.
* Experiment chains: group with clips.

---

## 5. Mitigations

* Loss: digitise daily.
* Overflow: enforce category limits.
* Duplication: merge before encoding.
