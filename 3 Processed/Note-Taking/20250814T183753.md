# Reading Protocol (Condensed)

### 1. Pre-read Setup

* Create `/sources/src-book-...` dossier: bibliographic data, High-signal pages, Notes.
* Workbook \[REF] thread: ID, title, intent, target decisions/projects.
* Set capture cap: ≤10 notes per chapter. Define one “primary hunt”.

### 2. First Pass (Analogue Capture)

* Read with index cards, 1 idea per card (ID: YYDOY-SS).
* Card front: title (3–6 words), statement, evidence. Leave implication blank unless immediate.
* Mark type with shape code (dot principle, slash pattern, square metric, triangle question).
* Workbook: meta-threads only (no full notes).

### 3. Post-chapter Distillation

* Cull to ≤10 cards.
* On kept: add implication + next step.
* For decision-level ideas, open \[DEC] or \[Q] thread.
* Photograph kept cards into `/_inbox`.

### 4. Daily Sweep & Encoding

* For each kept card → atomic note in `/notes/` with full timestamp ID.

  * Fields: statement, evidence, implication, action.
  * Tag with closed vocab, link to maps/projects.
* Update source dossier with high-signal pages + note links.
* Workbook: expand \[DEC]/\[EXP] threads into decision records or experiment specs.

### 5. Application (≤72h)

* Test one Play/Principle in a live project that week.
* Record in `/experiments/` or project file; link results back to notes.

### 6. Review Loop

* Place 3–5 most critical cards in Leitner box.
* Monthly audit of source dossier:

  * Which notes fed into projects?
  * Archive unused after 60 days unless durable.

### 7. Time Allocation (3.5-day window)

* Day 1: Read + capture first half, distill.
* Day 2: Read + distill second half, encode first half.
* Day 3: Encode second half, launch application test.
* Half-day: 200-word synthesis in dossier, link to at least one map, close all workbook threads.

### Key Constraints

* ≤10 notes per chapter.
* Encode within 48h.
* 1 tested Play per book per week.
* Archive unused after 60 days unless foundational.
