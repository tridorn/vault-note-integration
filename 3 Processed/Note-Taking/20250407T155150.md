# Note-Taking

---

## Overview

Note-taking is the structured interface between reading and writing, organised into modular components. It requires future refinement on its overlap with other systems.

---

## Sources

A note always attaches to somethingâ€”external input or internal thought. Writing such as articles begins to overlap with other systems.

* Books
* Lectures
* Podcasts
* Videos
* Meetings
* Conversations

---

## Types

Different notes serve different levels of abstraction, from trivial reminders to conceptual thinking.

* Reference
* Philosophical
* Project / Task
* Creative
* Collaborative
* Quick Jots

---

## Frameworks

Independent toolkits for structuring notes, adaptable across types.

* Linear Notes
* Mind Maps
* Flowcharts
* Sketch Notes
* Outlines

---

## Phases

The process is segmented for clarity and utility.

* **Harvesting**: capture raw material before it is lost.
* **Structuring**: reorganise and personalise into understandable form.
* **Synthesising**: distil into atomic, reusable concepts.

## Practices
