# Obsidian Lifecycle Folder Structure (Condensed)

## Top-Level Folders

```
00_System/    # Infrastructure: templates, scripts, media, logs
01_Capture/   # Raw inputs, shortest stay
02_Triage/    # Clarify, route, decide
03_Nurture/   # Uncommitted but worth saving
04_Plan/      # Active projects and tasks
05_Work/      # Drafts, research, prototypes
06_Deliver/   # Finished outputs
07_Learn/     # Journals, reflections, reviews
08_Library/   # Evergreen knowledge
98_Archive/   # Cold storage, inactive
```

## Folder Purposes & Rules

**00\_System/**
System assets only. Automatable, reusable, replaceable. No content notes.

**01\_Capture/**
Inbox for raw notes (quick jots, clips, memos, dropped files). Process daily. Do not organize.

**02\_Triage/**
Make decisions: act, defer, delegate, reference, delete. No long-term storage.

**03\_Nurture/**
Someday ideas, backlogs, waiting-on. Reviewed weekly. Promote to Plan or delete.

**04\_Plan/**
Committed projects, tasks, milestones. Every item needs an intended outcome. Reviewed weekly.

**05\_Work/**
Workbench for drafts, research, prototypes. Regularly clean and move completed work to Deliver.

**06\_Deliver/**
Final outputs: reports, articles, releases, assets. Only “definition of done.”

**07\_Learn/**
Reflections, journals, reviews, lessons. Source of future Library content.

**08\_Library/**
Evergreen: concepts, principles, methods, patterns, resources. Clean metadata required.

**98\_Archive/**
Inactive but retained: completed projects, stale notes, old reviews. Default sink for >12 months untouched.

## Lifecycle Transitions

* Capture → Triage: daily
* Triage → Nurture: deferred items
* Nurture → Plan: weekly commitment
* Plan → Work: when execution starts
* Work → Deliver: once done
* Deliver → Learn: reflection after output
* Learn → Library: enduring insights
* Any → Archive: obsolete or >12 months inactive

---

## Maintenance Rhythm

* Daily: triage Capture
* Weekly: review Nurture and Plan
* Biweekly: prune Work
* Monthly: audit Library
* Quarterly: prune Archive

---

## Optional Enhancements

* **Naming:** Projects `PYYYY-NNN-ShortSlug`, Notes `YYYYMMDDHHmmss.md`, Journals `YYYY/MM/DD.md`
* **Automation:** auto-update metadata, enforce stage via folder, orphan-check Library notes

---

## Why This Works

* Lifecycle-driven: each note has a clear stage
* Sharp folder purpose: no ambiguity
* Controlled depth: hierarchy is flat and readable
* Defined transitions: easy to know when to move
* Extensible: integrates with Git, Dataview, Breadcrumbs
