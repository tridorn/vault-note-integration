# Quotes in Note-Taking System

## Core Principles

* **Separation of Sources**: Distinguish verbatim excerpts from original writing.
* **Inline Quotes**: Use quotation marks for brief passages, integrated into sentences.

  * Example: According to Smith, "AI will revolutionize industries."
* **Block Quotes**: For longer excerpts, use clear formatting (`>` in Markdown).

  * Example:

    > AI's potential in the next decade is immense. From healthcare to finance, every domain will witness a transformation. The key is to remain adaptable and forward-thinking.
* **Attribution**: Always credit the source for block quotes.
