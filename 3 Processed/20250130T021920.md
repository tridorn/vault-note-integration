When consuming information, the shift must be from passive reception to active cognition. The medium is only a conduit; the aim is to internalize and reconstruct knowledge.

1. **Socratic Engagement**: Continuously interrogate each idea. Ask why it matters, what assumptions it rests on, and how it fits into your existing framework.
2. **Feynman Technique**: Re-explain the material in your own words, as if teaching. Simplicity reveals gaps and forces reconstruction.
3. **Mind Mapping**: Replace linear notes with spatial organization of concepts. This highlights connections and aids synthesis.
4. **Active Recall and Application**: Test yourself without the source, apply concepts in hypothetical or practical contexts. Build intuitive grasp, not rote memory.
5. **Deconstruct the Medium**: Strip away stylistic framing and bias, extract the universally useful essence.

The objective is to make the content yours—reframed, questioned, applied—so that the medium becomes irrelevant once the message is absorbed.
