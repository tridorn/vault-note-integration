# Taking Notes of Lectures in Note-Taking System

## Process

1. **Preparation**: Skim syllabus or agenda to identify key topics and concepts.
2. **During lecture**: Capture main points, examples, and questions. For recordings or transcripts, AI can assist with transcription and summarization.
3. **Post-lecture**: Review notes, restructure them into coherent summaries. AI can draft summaries, but manual verification is necessary.
4. **Obsidian integration**: Create a dedicated note per lecture with metadata and links to related entries in the Zettelkasten.
5. **Concept notes**: For significant ideas, generate atomic notes. AI can produce initial drafts from raw input.
6. **Ongoing refinement**: Periodically revisit and update notes to reinforce understanding and maintain a living system.
