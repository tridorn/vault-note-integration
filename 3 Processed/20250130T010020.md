# Structuring Raw Input into Atomic Notes

**Atomic Notes**: Self-contained units covering a single concept, idea, or question. They are the smallest meaningful building blocks of a knowledge base, easy to link and reference.

**Purpose**:

* Prevent overload by isolating ideas.
* Enable cross-domain linking.
* Allow organic scalability.

### 1. Initial Pass

* Skim source to identify themes and structure.
* Note headings, recurring terms, summaries.

### 2. Extract Core Themes

* Identify main subjects or arguments.
* Use these as the first layer of division.

### 3. Break into Subtopics

* For each theme, isolate definitions, examples, supporting arguments.
* Capture questions raised.

### 4. Criteria for Atomic Topics

* Single focus.
* Understandable without external context.
* Adds value.
* Linkable to other concepts.

### 5. Compile Candidate Topics

Example from time management:

* Pomodoro Technique
* Time Blocking
* Procrastination Mitigation
* Eisenhower Matrix
* Multitasking Impact

### 6. Prioritize

* Keep only those aligned with your objectives and immediate use.

### 7. Use the Input → Process → Output Template

* **Title**: Clear concept name.
* **Objectives**: Purpose, goals, key questions.
* **Input**: Concise source summary.
* **Process**: Your analysis, links to other notes.
* **Output**: Insights, actions, applications.
* **Metadata**: Source, tags.

### 8. Link Notes

* Cross-reference related notes in Process or Output.

### 9. Review and Update

* Periodically refine, add, or merge as understanding deepens.

### Efficiency Techniques

* **Active reading/listening**: Annotate, write margin questions.
* **SQ3R**: Survey, question, read, recite, review.
* **Mind mapping**: Visualize connections for complex domains.
* **Feynman Technique**: Explain to self, detect knowledge gaps.

### Granularity Check

* Too broad: Multiple independent concepts. Split.
* Too narrow: Single fact without context. Merge.
* Just right: Answers a specific question or explores one idea fully.

### Integration into Note System

* Maintain template consistency.
* Organize by tags/folders; create index notes.
* Use keywords and metadata for searchability.
* Not all input becomes a note—filter for value.
