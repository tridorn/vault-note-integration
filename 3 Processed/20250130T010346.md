**Referencing and Discarding Sources**

### 1. When to Reference

* Reference when accuracy, authority, or traceability are critical (academic work, statistics, canonical texts).
* Useful during the learning phase or when ongoing updates from the source matter.
* In Obsidian, link sources under **References** using backlinks or standard citation formats.

**Example**

```
# References
- [Cal Newport, "Deep Work"](https://www.example.com)
```

### 2. Handling Transient Content (ChatGPT, web snippets)

* These are stepping stones, not definitive sources.
* Once synthesized into your own notes, original text has little value.
* Retain only minimal references if they marked a turning point in your thinking.

**Options**

* **Synthesize and delete**: rewrite in your own words, discard raw conversation.
* **Minimal marker**: “ChatGPT conversation on \[topic], \[date], clarified \[idea].”
* **Temporary holding**: use `#discardable` or a **Temporary** folder, review monthly, delete if unused.

### 3. Key Practices

* Reference only when necessary; avoid cluttering notes with weak links.
* Focus final notes on your own synthesis, not source fidelity.
* Use temporary holding for uncertain material, then purge.

### Example Workflow (ChatGPT case)

* **Input**: summary of explanation.
* **Process**: reflection, questions.
* **Output**: actionable conclusion.
* Record only a brief pointer to the conversation, then delete after review.

### Conclusion

* Keep references for authoritative sources where accuracy and revisitation matter.
* For ephemeral material, extract insights, rely on your processed notes, and discard the rest.
