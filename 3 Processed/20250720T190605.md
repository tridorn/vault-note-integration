# Note Body Structure

A future-proof format for fast capture, layered refinement, automation, and human readability.

---

## Principles

* **Atomic**: One idea per note.
* **Layered**: Keep metadata, structure, content, commentary, and history separate.
* **Progressive**: Support quick capture → refinement.
* **Metadata-aligned**: Body mirrors YAML (title, summary, status).
* **Machine-parsable**: Clear headers and blocks for tools (Dataview, LLMs).

---

## Canonical Template

````markdown
# Title (sync with YAML)

> Summary (same as desc.summary; quote box with keywords)

---

## 1. Context
- Why this note exists (trigger, goal, or source).
- Stage / Status (badges/callouts).
  > [!info] Status  
  > stage: work  
  > status: draft  
  > linked project: [[P2025-001-DeepWork]]

---

## 2. Core Content
Main body: insight, explanation, task.  
Use:
- `##` for major sections, `###` for sublayers.
- Callouts (`> [!tip]`, `> [!warning]`) for emphasis.
- Full sentences; one idea per paragraph.
- Inline links `[[uid-title]]`.

---

## 3. Related
- **See also**: linked notes.  
- **Backlink context**: brief explanation.

---

## 4. Commentary / Development Log
For refinement history.  

```md
### 2025-07-20
- Promoted from Triage → Plan
- Converted into method

## 5. Next Steps (if active)

* [ ] Add examples
* [ ] Request input
* [ ] Move to Library

## Minimal Capture Note  

```markdown
# Untitled insight

> Thought during commute: silence discomfort → weak opinions → "tension tolerance" model?
````

Triage later: assign title, metadata, structure.

## Evergreen Note Example

```markdown
# Cognitive Switching Tax

> Shifting tasks costs up to 23 min focus recovery.

---

## 1. Definition
Decrease in efficiency when switching tasks.  

## 2. Examples
- Email during writing  
- Slack mid-debug  

## 3. Related Concepts
[[FlowState]], [[Attention_Management]]  

## 4. Sources
Cal Newport, Deep Work  
Gloria Mark, "Multitasking in the Digital Age"
```

---

## Tools / Enhancements

* **Note Composer**: scaffold from metadata.
* **YAML-sync linter**: enforce title + summary alignment.
* **Dataview**: index incomplete/missing sections.
* **Callouts**: structure visually.
* **Regex rules**: enforce `Definition`, `Related`, etc. in Library notes.

---

## Good Note Checklist

* `# Title` synced with YAML.
* Summary visible in previews.
* Clear sectioning for reuse/extraction.
* Inline links strengthen graph.
* Optional: commentary (history), next steps (if active).
