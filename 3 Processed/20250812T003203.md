**Premise**
Notebook must: capture fast, decide cleanly, migrate work, and preserve audit. Best design: two layers.

* **Operations Log (OL):** raw chronological notes.
* **Registers:** compact, canonical lists for decisions, tasks, waits, risks, knowledge. Structure lives here.

**Architecture**

1. **OL:** free-flow, minimal syntax, timestamped.
2. **Registers:** at back (20–30 pages), tabbed, sequential IDs (D001, T001, …).

**OL mechanics**

* Number pages; date only on change.
* One line per thought; diagrams inline.
* Timestamp each block (HH\:MM or range).

**Inline triggers (frictionless)**
\= decision; ! task; ? question; ^ risk; \~ waiting; + idea.
Write naturally after trigger. Example:
09:10 = Retain logs 30 days to cut audit prep 20%.

**Extraction protocol (end of day)**

1. Scan OL for triggers.
2. Promote to Registers:

   * D: statement, rationale, scope, date, status.
   * T: verb-first, owner, due, system.
   * W: counterpart, deliverable, due, check date.
   * R: condition → impact, mitigation, test date.
   * K: distilled snippet.
3. Assign ID. Annotate OL line with \[ID].
4. Migrate tasks to digital (OF, Jira, Cal). Mark “migrated HH\:MM” if delayed.

**Registers: templates (≤5 lines each)**

* **D:** statement; rationale; scope; date; status; links.
* **T:** action; system; due; owner; source.
* **W:** counterpart/deliverable; due; next check; source.
* **R:** condition → impact; mitigation; review date; source.
* **K:** title; 2–5 lines; cross-refs.

**Retrieval**

* Each Register starts with mini-index: ID → short title → pages.
* OL breadcrumbs: bracketed IDs.

**Daily/weekly cadence**

* Start day: write date; declare 1–3 outcomes inline as decisions or tasks.
* Every 30 minutes: timestamp, capture freely, sparse triggers.
* End of day: extract, migrate, close loops.
* Weekly: summary from Registers: top 3 D, aging W/T, 1 R to test. Supersede old Ds.

**Tools discipline**

* Fountain pen: OL.
* Micron 01: Registers, timestamps.
* Micron 005: edits.
* Highlighter: IDs only, color by quarter; mark Active D.

**Advantages vs margin model**

* Capture is fast, structure delayed.
* Canonical items centralized.
* Retrieval deterministic by ID.
* OL tolerates sprawl, mid-page starts.
* Explicit supersession for decisions.
