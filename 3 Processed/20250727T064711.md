# Integrated Writing–Drawing System (Condensed)

### I. Core Definition

Writing and drawing are not separate arts but externalisation tools.

* **Writing**: linear, symbolic, dense.
* **Drawing**: spatial, relational, immediate.
  Focus: functional sketching, not aesthetics. Goal: capture relationships and structures.

### II. Target Style

Objective: fluid hybrid notation for mental models, reasoning, hierarchies, and decision maps.
Key features:

1. Modular layouts (nodes, flows, clusters).
2. Mixed syntax (sentences + arrows + icons).
3. Line economy, no decoration.
4. Consistent functional icons.
5. Spatial layering (vertical for logic, horizontal for options).

### III. Training Components

| Component          | Focus                           | Method                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Micro-sketching    | Arrows, boxes, trees            | Memorise 10–15 patterns |
| Symbolic shorthand | Glyphs replace categories       | Build a visual lexicon  |
| Compressed writing | ≤5-word summaries               | Daily practice          |
| Spatial layout     | Readability through positioning | Use quadrants/templates |
| Visual hierarchy   | Size, weight, emphasis          | Practice zoom levels    |
| Chain reasoning    | Logic and decisions as flows    | Use maps and trees      |

Principle: draw relationships, not objects.

### IV. Application Modes

1. **Thinking**: premises top-left, flow in center, options in margins.
2. **Concept capture**: title box, 3–5 clusters, symbols for risks/unknowns.
3. **Project planning**: timeline, forks, task modules, checkboxes/bars.

### V. Development Phases

* **Phase 1 – Integration**: switch fluidly text↔sketch, keep a visual notebook, use templates.
* **Phase 2 – Personalisation**: design your glyph set (20–30 icons), practice condensed layouts.
* **Phase 3 – Acceleration**: live ideation on paper, iterate clarity, add modularity (e.g. color).

### VI. Drawing Depth

Train only enough to never lose an idea. No perspective or realism required. Focus on:

* Instant glyph fluency (lightbulb, clock, person, ?).
* Arrow variations (causal, inhibitory, bidirectional).
* Basic structures (boxes, trees, matrices, loops).

### Identity

You are not writer or illustrator but **mapper of thought**. Precision over polish.
