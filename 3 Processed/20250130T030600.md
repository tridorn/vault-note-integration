# New Reading Method (Condensed)

Effective active reading requires structured engagement with the text through targeted strategies:

1. **Annotation**

   * Highlight only essential points; use varied marks for themes vs. details.
   * Employ a personal code (e.g., \* = key idea, ? = unclear, ! = novel insight).

2. **Marginalia**

   * Record reactions, agreements, or objections.
   * Pose critical questions about argument and evidence.
   * Paraphrase dense passages to test comprehension.

3. **Structured Process (SQ3R)**

   * Survey headings and structure.
   * Formulate questions.
   * Read to answer them.
   * Recite main points to reinforce.
   * Review periodically.

4. **Reflective Reading**

   * Treat the text as dialogue with the author; challenge assumptions and logic.
   * Compare with other texts to contextualize arguments.

5. **Socratic Inquiry**

   * Ask about premises, implications, validity.
   * Note thesis vs. counterpoints for balanced evaluation.

6. **Auditory Reinforcement**

   * Read aloud to strengthen recall.
   * Record and replay complex sections if useful.
