# Condensed Reading Method

### I. Preparation

* **Select text with clear objectives.** Define what you want to extract.
* **Survey material.** Skim contents, headings, abstracts for structure and priorities.

### II. Active Reading

* **Surveyâ€“Question (SQ3R).** Preview, then pose guiding questions.
* **Annotation system.**

  * Selective highlighting and underlining.
  * Symbols for importance, uncertainty, connections.
  * Marginal notes: paraphrase difficult passages, note reactions, ask critical questions.
* **Dialogue with the author.** Question assumptions, compare with other texts.
* **Socratic probing.** Clarify premises, test counterarguments, document thesis vs. antithesis.
* **Auditory reinforcement.** Read aloud or record/playback dense sections.

### III. Consolidation

* **Summarize.** Capture chapters or sections in your own words.
* **Review.** Revisit periodically with spaced repetition.
* **Discussion.** Test ideas in conversation or teaching to others.
* **Application.** Connect insights to practical contexts.
* **Digital tools.** Use note-taking apps and flashcards for recall and organization.

### Implementation Flow

1. **Before:** Set objectives, survey text.
2. **During:** Read actively, annotate, interrogate arguments, apply auditory reinforcement.
3. **After:** Summarize, review, discuss, apply, and organize digitally.
