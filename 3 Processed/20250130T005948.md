# Atomic Notes in IPO – Condensed Guide

### 1. Definition

An atomic note:

* Has a single, well-defined focus.
* Can be understood independently.
* Is reusable and linkable without redundancy.

### 2. From Broad Input to Atomic Topics

**Step 1: Identify Themes**

* Skim for headings, recurring terms, and main ideas.
* List high-level themes.

**Step 2: Group Related Details**

* Cluster information under each theme.
* Distinguish core concepts (worth a note) from supporting details (examples, anecdotes).

**Step 3: Refine into Atomic Topics**

* Frame each as a single, answerable question or precise statement.
* Check independence and remove trivial or overlapping points.
* Prioritize topics that are reusable or actionable.

### 3. Structuring Atomic Notes

Use the **Input → Process → Output** model:

* **Input**: Core idea in your own words.
* **Process**: Reflection, links to other concepts, critiques.
* **Output**: Key takeaways, actions, or decisions.

### 4. Practical Workflow

1. **Collect** raw highlights or excerpts.
2. **Decompose** into a hierarchical outline.
3. **Extract** atomic questions or statements.
4. **Create** separate notes for each.
5. **Link** related notes via tags or backlinks.

  **Output**: Trial with a timer app.

### 5. Efficiency Practices

* Work iteratively; not all material must be atomized immediately.
* Use tags to connect notes to broader themes.
* Maintain reusability by ensuring each note stands alone.
* Apply a standard template for consistency.
