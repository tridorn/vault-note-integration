## Operational Reading Protocol

### 1. Pre-read setup

* Create source dossier in /sources/: bibliographic data, High-signal pages, Notes.
* Workbook \[REF] thread: ID, title, purpose, possible project impact.
* Constraints: ≤10 notes per chapter, one primary hunt focus.

### 2. First pass reading (capture)

* Read with index cards. One idea per card, ID = YYDOY-SS.
* Card front: short title, statement, evidence. Leave implication blank.
* Mark type with shape code: dot principle, slash pattern, square metric, triangle question.
* Workbook: only meta-log threads, no full notes.

### 3. Post-chapter distillation

* Sort cards: keep/cull, ≤10 kept.
* On kept: add Implication + Next on back.
* Decision-level ideas → workbook \[DEC]/\[Q] thread.
* Photograph kept cards → /\_inbox.

### 4. Daily sweep and encoding

* Encode kept cards as atomic notes in /notes/ with timestamp ID. Include statement, evidence, implication, action.
* Tag and link into maps/projects.
* Update source dossier with high-signal pages and note links.
* Workbook threads: update with IDs, decision records, or experiments.

### 5. Application within 72h

* Test at least one Play or Principle in a live project.
* Document in /experiments/ or project file. Link outcomes back to notes.

### 6. Review loop

* 3–5 key cards into Leitner box for spaced review.
* Monthly audit of source dossier:

  * Which notes linked to projects?
  * Unused → archive after 60 days unless durable.

### 7. Time allocation (3.5 days)

* Day 1: read half + distill.
* Day 2: finish + distill, encode first half.
* Day 3: encode second half, launch one application test.
* Half-day: 200-word synthesis, link into map, close workbook threads.

### Core constraints

* ≤10 kept notes per chapter.
* Encode latency <48h.
* One tested Play per book within week.
* Archive unused after 60 days unless foundational.
