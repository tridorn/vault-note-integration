# Core principles

1. One control plane: the workbook routes thinking but is not the archive.
2. One canonical store: markdown vault is the durable record.
3. Analogue for cognition, digital for retrieval. Cards/boards for ideation; markdown for indexing.
4. Stable IDs across all surfaces. Link by ID, not by title.
5. Bias to action: notes exist to drive decisions, experiments, deliverables.

# Components

* **Workbook**: daily ledger and router. Threads with IDs.
* **Index cards**: atomic captures; one idea each.
* **Whiteboards/post-its**: temporary synthesis; photograph and treat as sources.
* **Markdown vault**: canonical notes, decisions, experiments, projects, maps.
* **Task manager/calendar**: only tasks and blocks.
* **Project repos**: where work ships; link back with IDs.

# IDs and linking

* Short ID (paper): `YYDOY-SS` (e.g. 25227-03).
* Full ID (digital): timestamp + label (e.g. `2025-08-15T0934-dec-pricing-fence`).
* Markdown links: `[[full-id]]`. Workbook uses short ID + thread code.

# Workbook threads

Header: `[CODE] YYDOY-SS Title`.
Codes: WIP, DEC, EXP, Q, TASK, REF, MTG, LOG, IDEA.

Body: Context, Signal, Implication, Next.

Example:

```
[DEC] 25227-03 Positioning fence v0
Context: Enterprise balks, SMB accepts.
Signal: 4/7 enterprise calls want modularity; SMB CTR +38% on bundle.
Implication: Split enterprise, keep SMB bundle.
Next: Create decision record; link EXP 25227-04.
```

**Daily sweep**: convert threads.

* DEC → decision record.
* EXP → experiment spec/result.
* REF → notes/cards.
* TASK → task manager (with ID).
* Margin: write full IDs linking back.

# Index cards

Front: title, statement, evidence, implication.
Back: short ID, type, source, tags, next.

Edge coding for sorting: dot = principle, slash = pattern, square = metric, triangle = question, notch = action.

Flow: capture → photo to /\_inbox → sweep → type only high-signal → assign IDs → link → Leitner for rehearsal.

# Vault schema

```
/notes/       atomic reusable notes
/decisions/   ADR-like decision records
/experiments/ specs/results
/projects/    briefs and status
/sources/     book/paper/meeting dossiers
/maps/        topic indexes
/archive/
/_inbox/      photos, scans pending
```

Atomic note template: metadata (id, type, title, source, status, tags, links) + Statement, Evidence, Implication, Action.
Decision, experiment, source, project, and map templates as above (short, ADR-like).

# Workflows

**Daily (30–45m)**

* Start with WIP thread.
* Capture with short IDs.
* Sweep once: convert DEC/EXP/REF → markdown, TASK → task manager, photo boards/cards.
* Link artifacts back with full IDs.

**Weekly (60m)**

* Merge duplicates.
* Update maps.
* Review decisions due.
* Cull weak notes; archive stale experiments.

**Monthly (45m)**

* Audit metrics.
* Tighten tag list.
* Promote applied notes.

# Operating constraints

* ≤12 workbook threads/day.
* ≤10 notes per chapter/hour of source.
* Encode latency <48h.
* For every 5 notes, schedule 1 experiment/play.
* Quote density <10%.

# Metrics

* Encode latency <24h.
* Action ratio ≥60%.
* Retrieval time <2m.
* Decision follow-up ≥90%.
* Vault bloat 20–40%.
* Card loss <2%.

# Failure modes

* Workbook turns diary → enforce thread cap, route all.
* Media fragmentation → IDs + sweep.
* Tag sprawl → closed vocab in maps.
* Scanning drag → photo, type only high-signal.
* Decision amnesia → ADR with review dates.

# Minimal kit

Workbook, 20 blank + 10 active cards, pen, slip box (5 Leitner slots), plain-text editor, git repo, phone shortcut to /\_inbox.

# Three-day implementation

Day 1: create vault folders/templates, closed tags, start workbook with grammar.
Day 2: run first sweep, produce records and notes.
Day 3: run experiment, log outcomes, review metrics.

This is the condensed form. It preserves the architecture and unique operating mechanics without the padding. Would you like me to apply the same reduction to your *other notes on the same theme* so we can then merge into a unified baseline before deriving insights?
