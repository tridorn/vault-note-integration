# Cornell Note-Taking: Condensed Guide

### Structure

Page split into:

* **Notes (Right, \~70%)** – capture main ideas during the session.
* **Cues (Left, \~30%)** – add keywords, prompts, and connections after the session.
* **Summary (Bottom)** – brief synthesis of key points.

### Preparation

* Pre-divide sections or use a digital template.
* Define your session goals to focus attention.

### During Session – Notes Section

* Capture *key* ideas, not transcripts.
* Paraphrase to force engagement.
* Use abbreviations/symbols (→ for “leads to”, # for “key concept”).
* Bullet or indent related items for hierarchy.

### Post-Session – Cues Section

* Immediately add keywords, open-ended questions, and links to related concepts.
* Keep cues concise, serving as recall triggers.
* Use connections to integrate with previous knowledge.

### Summary Section

* Distil main themes in 2–3 sentences.
* Include your interpretation and application relevance.
* Make it a quick-access memory hook.

### Review Technique

* Cover Notes; use Cues to self-test.
* Answer Cues’ questions without looking, revisit Notes if gaps appear.
* Optionally re-write Summary after 1–2 weeks to reinforce.

### Digital Adaptation (e.g., Obsidian)

* Use headings for sections.
* Link Cues to related notes.
* Create reusable Cornell template.

### Core Value

Turns passive note-taking into active learning by enforcing review, connection-making, and concise synthesis.
