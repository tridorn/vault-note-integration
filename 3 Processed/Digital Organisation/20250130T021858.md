# Use Questions When

* **Your objective is retention and active recall.** Questions force you to reconstruct answers, strengthening memory.
* **The subject is exploratory or uncertain.** A question signals gaps and directs investigation.
* **The material is complex.** Breaking it down into interrogatives prevents bloated, unfocused headings.

# Avoid Questions When

* **Speed overrides depth.** In meetings or lectures, descriptive shorthand is faster.
* **The content is narrative or procedural.** Instructions, timelines, and stories read more cleanly without forced questions.
* **The information is self-evident.** If thereâ€™s no real inquiry, a question adds friction without value.

# Rule of Thumb

Frame notes as questions only when doing so creates cognitive pressure that improves recall or guides inquiry. Otherwise, use direct descriptive headings. Blend styles pragmatically; consistency matters less than functional clarity.
