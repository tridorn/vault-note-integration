## Architecture

**Principle:** analogue for cognition, digital for retrieval.

1. **Capture:** Handwritten slips (one idea each).
2. **Distil:** Same day, reduce to atomic statement + evidence + implication.
3. **Encode:** Markdown with strict metadata, stable IDs.
4. **Link:** Cross-connect notes, build maps of content.
5. **Rehearse:** Spaced prompts for decision-relevant notes.

## Identifiers and filing

* **Note ID:** yyyymmddhhmm-slug
* **Source ID:** src-type-author-year-slug
* **Dirs:**

  * /notes/ (atomic notes)
  * /sources/ (dossier, excerpts, claims)
  * /maps/ (topic indexes)
  * /projects/ (active builds)
  * /\_inbox/ (transient scans)

---

## Card types

Minimal taxonomy: Claim, Principle, Pattern, Metric, Play, Counterexample, Question, Quote.

---

## Markdown templates

**Note:** ID, type, title, source, tags, links, status. Body = statement, evidence, implication, action.

**Source dossier:** bibliographic metadata, thesis, outline, high-signal pages, key claims.

**Map:** cluster notes by type (principles, plays, counterexamples).

---

## Analogue workflow

* Pre-print 100 short-ID stickers weekly.
* One card per idea. Use margin symbols (circle=claim, triangle=question, square=play).
* End of day: photo keepers into inbox.
* Cull aggressively (≤30%).

---

## Distillation rules

* Paraphrase; quote only if wording adds force.
* Every note must hold statement, evidence, implication.
* Tie to a decision/experiment or archive.
* Merge duplicates weekly.

---

## Retrieval and reuse

* Controlled tags (/maps/\_tags.md). Examples: strategy, pricing, growth.
* Prefer links over tags.
* Maintain two keystone maps (pricing, discovery). New maps only if ≥5 notes cluster.
* Projects reference notes by link, not copy.

---

## Review cadence

* **Daily (15m):** empty inbox, distil 3 cards.
* **Weekly (30m):** add 5 links, kill 2 weak notes.
* **Monthly (45m):** promote applied notes, archive dead topics.

---

## Spaced rehearsal

* 10–20 notes, each with one cloze Q/A.
* Review 2, 7, 21, 60 days. Demote unused notes.

---

## Media specialisation

* **Books:** chX pY.
* **Papers:** section/p/fig.
* **Videos/podcasts:** timestamp.
* **Meetings/talks:** agenda item + outcome.
* **Web:** url + access date.

---

## Constraints

* Max 10 notes per chapter or audio hour.
* 1 play scheduled per 5 notes.
* Quote density <10%.
* Notes unlinked after 7 days revert to inbox.

---

## Example book cycle (3.5 days)

Day 1: read, 30–60 slips.
Day 2: distil 10 notes + source dossier, link pass.
Day 3: apply one play, record outcome.
Half day: 200-word synthesis, prune 3 notes.

---

## Trade-offs

* Analogue adds capture cost but deepens synthesis.
* Strict metadata slows input, speeds retrieval.
* Fewer, denser notes reduce serendipity, raise decision-hit rate.

## Minimal kit

Analogue: cards, pen, stickers, clipboard.
Digital: text editor, git repo, scaffold script.
