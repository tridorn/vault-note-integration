**1. Zettelkasten – Knowledge Networks and Idea Generation**
Method of atomic, linked notes enabling non-linear connections. Best for long-term research and creative synthesis, evolving into a dense network of insights. Fits the **Process Layer**, using backlinks and graph views in Obsidian to surface inter-topic connections.

**2. Mind Mapping – Structural Visualization**
Graphical mapping of ideas branching from a central concept. Useful for early-stage topic exploration, conceptual overviews, and project structure. Can replace the **Input Layer** for visually summarizing new material; integrate via Obsidian plugins or external mapping tools.

**3. Feynman Technique – Comprehension Through Simplification**
Explain concepts in plain language to reveal knowledge gaps. Effective for mastering skills or preparing for exams. Fits the **Process Layer**; create dedicated explanation sections in notes to refine clarity.

**4. SMART Goals – From Insight to Action**
Framework ensuring goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Ideal for turning processed knowledge into actionable steps. Belongs in the **Output Layer**; store as structured tasks in Obsidian.

**5. PARA – High-Level Information Architecture**
Organizes material into Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives. Supports both task and knowledge management, reducing cognitive load. Functions as a meta-structure across all layers, guiding digital organization.

**6. Pomodoro – Focus and Time Segmentation**
25-minute work intervals with short breaks. Increases focus, useful for processing large content or executing tasks. Complements the **Input Layer** for sustained productivity.

**7. SQR3 – Structured Reading**
Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review. Promotes active reading and retention for dense materials. Strengthens the **Input Layer** with a repeatable comprehension template.

**Selection Logic**

* Zettelkasten: ongoing knowledge expansion
* Mind Mapping: relational clarity
* Feynman: mastery and simplification
* SMART: execution discipline
* PARA: organizational backbone
* Pomodoro: sustained throughput
* SQR3: depth in reading

Combined within the Input → Process → Output model, these methods yield a flexible, layered system for learning, synthesis, and execution.
