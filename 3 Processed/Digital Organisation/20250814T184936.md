# Decision framing

Choosing between two note-taking models:

**Model A — Atomic-only**
Every fact/principle in its own note. Source exists only as metadata.

**Model B — Atomic + Source Dossier**
In addition to atomic notes, one file per source with synthesis, bibliographic data, high-signal locators, and links to derived notes.

## Trade-offs

**Retrieval**

* A: Fast for cross-topic search; no source navigation.
* B: Useful when recall starts from the source itself.

**Cognitive mapping**

* A: Forces conceptual navigation, loses narrative flow.
* B: Preserves argument structure and reasoning environment.

**Maintenance**

* A: Zero duplication.
* B: Slight overhead (\~1–2 minutes per note) to update dossier.

**Volume**

* A: Better for low-value, throwaway sources.
* B: Better for dense, recurring, or strategic sources.

**Decision support**

* A: Ensures all claims live in atomic notes.
* B: Enables quick review of reasoning context for past decisions.

## Recommendation

Adopt a hybrid with clear triggers.
Always use atomic notes; create a dossier only if:

* The source yields ≥5 atomic notes, and
* It is dense, revisitable, or strategically significant.

Result:

* No dossier bloat.
* Anchors exist for high-value sources.
* Overhead limited to high-ROI cases.

## Minimal dossier template

id: src-book-dunford-2019-obviously-awesome
medium: book
title: Obviously Awesome
author: April Dunford
year: 2019

Synthesis (~200 words)  
High-signal sections  
Key notes → [[note-links]]  
Decisions influenced → [[decision-links]]  
Experiments spawned → [[experiment-links]]  
```

---

## Workflow integration

1. REF thread defines source, kill criteria.
2. Capture → atomic notes.
3. If dossier-trigger met, create dossier during Day 2 synthesis.
4. Link notes ↔ dossier ↔ decisions/experiments.
5. For review: start from concept map or source dossier.
