# Formalized Note-Taking Framework

### Structure

Three sequential stages: **Input** → **Processing** → **Synthesis**, with feedback loops between them.

---

### 1. Source (Input Phase)

**Purpose:** Acquire raw material from books, articles, lectures, meetings, or prior notes.
**Actions:**

* Survey for headings, key ideas, summaries.
* Define scope and intent before engaging.
* Collect quotes, data, and questions with minimal annotation.

**Output:** Unstructured set of themes, points, and questions for later processing.

---

### 2. Capture and Structure (Processing Phase)

**Purpose:** Organize raw material into a structured, accessible form (Cornell method works well).
**Actions:**

* **Cue column:** Keywords, questions, prompts.
* **Notes column:** Summaries and details.
* **Summary section:** Concise synthesis.
* Refine objectives and link to guiding questions.
* Flag actionable insights or gaps for follow-up.

**Output:** Structured notes with key ideas, guiding questions, and an initial synthesis.

---

### 3. Conceptual Notes (Synthesis Phase)

**Purpose:** Distill structured notes into **atomic, reusable concepts** using **Input → Process → Output**.
**Actions:**

* Break ideas into self-contained units.
* For each note:

  * **Input:** Core fact or idea.
  * **Process:** Analysis, connections, implications.
  * **Output:** Takeaways, actions, or further questions.
* Link related concepts to form a knowledge network.
* Periodically revisit for refinement.

**Output:** Interlinked atomic notes ready for strategic use.

### Stage Interaction

* Stage 1 feeds Stage 2 (raw → structured).
* Stage 2 feeds Stage 3 (structured → atomic).
* Stage 3 can trigger returns to earlier stages to fill gaps or expand connections.

---

### Usage

**Contexts:** Academic study, professional learning, creative ideation, strategic planning.
**Method:**

* Begin broad with varied sources.
* Incrementally structure.
* Continuously synthesize and link.

---

### Benefits

* Clear progression from raw input to actionable knowledge.
* Scalable across scope and complexity.
* Modular, reusable knowledge blocks.
* Built-in iteration for continual refinement.

---

**Example:**

* **Source:** Productivity book chapter.
* **Capture:** Cornell notes on Pomodoro and time blocking, with questions on team applicability.
* **Synthesis:** Separate notes for each technique with definitions, pros/cons, and an action plan to test.
