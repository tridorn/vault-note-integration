# Lifecycle-Driven Vault Scaffold

**Principle:** Every folder is a lifecycle stage; files move forward only. Structure is MECE, depth max = 3. Clarity from single-location rule.

---

## Design Logic

* **Numbered stages (00–09):** stable Git diffs, natural sort.
* **Eight lifecycle stages:** enough granularity, avoids micromanagement.
* **Three-depth limit:** use links/tags beyond.
* **Stage verbs:** names describe action.
* **Move, don’t copy:** one stage at a time.

 ├ Templates/   ├ Snippets/   ├ Media/   └ Logs/

01_Capture/         ← raw inflow, briefest stay
 ├ Quick_Notes/ ├ Web_Clips/ ├ Voice_Memos/ 
 ├ Scans_PDFs/ └ Inbox_Files/

02_Sort/            ← 2-min triage
 ├ Do_Now/ ├ Delegate/ ├ Defer/
 ├ Reference_Candidate/ └ Delete_Review/

03_Incubate/        ← not yet actionable
 ├ Ideas_Raw/ ├ Someday_Maybe/ ├ Backlog_Personal/
 ├ Backlog_Work/ └ Waiting_On/

04_Plan/            ← commit to outcomes
 ├ Projects_Active/ ├ Milestones/
 ├ Tasks_Next/ ├ Tasks_Scheduled/ └ Context_Lists/

 ├ Concepts/ ├ Principles/ ├ Methods/ ├ Patterns/

09_Archive/         ← long-term, rarely touched
 ├ Projects_Completed/ ├ Notes_Archived/
 ├ Assets_Archived/ └ Old_Reviews/
```

## Note Flow (example)

Capture → Sort → Incubate → Plan (active project) → Workbench (drafting) → Deliver → Reflect → Evergreen (distilled insight) → Archive.

## Git + Maintenance

1. `git init && git add . && git commit -m "Lifecycle scaffold v1"`
2. Atomic moves: relocate once per session, Git reflects progress.
3. Optional pre-commit hook: auto commit message (`05_Workbench → 06_Deliver`).
4. Quarterly pruning: collapse empty subfolders, structure self-tightens.
