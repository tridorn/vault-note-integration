# Note-Taking System: Concept Notes Overview

### 1. Core Notes

* **Purpose**: Define why the system exists. Emphasize learning, productivity, creativity. Goals: scalability, adaptability, reusability.
* **Three Phases**: Harvesting (collect), Structuring (organize), Synthesizing (refine and connect). Each explained separately.
* **Objectives Framework**: Establish Purpose, Goals, Key Questions as guiding criteria.
* **Medium-Agnostic Design**: System works across tools and formats. Compare Cornell notes, mind maps, outlines, sketches. Provide adaptation practices.

### 2. Phase Notes

* **Harvesting**: Scope, source engagement, extraction methods. Output: effective raw capture.
* **Structuring**: Organize into frameworks (outlines, maps, linear formats). Output: coherent structures.
* **Synthesizing**: Break into atomic notes using Input–Process–Output. Build Knowledge Network through linking.

### 3. Process Notes

* **Source Identification**: Define sources, selection criteria, quality checklist.
* **Raw Extraction**: Highlight, annotate. Balance thoroughness vs efficiency.
* **Theme Identification**: Cluster ideas into categories. Provide examples.
* **Contextualization**: Tie to Objectives. Template for Purpose–Goals–Questions.
* **Note Framing**: Choose framework by material type. Examples.
* **Atomic Breakdown**: Define granularity of concepts. Best practices.
* **IPO Application**: Use Input–Process–Output to structure atomic notes.
* **Interlinking**: Methods for linking (Obsidian, Notion). Example networks.

### 4. Component Notes

* **Sources**: Types (books, lectures, brainstorming). Engagement guidelines, source checklists.
* **Harvest Notes**: Raw annotated material, examples.
* **Structured Notes**: Organized content in frameworks, examples.
* **Conceptual Notes**: Atomic notes via IPO, examples.
* **Knowledge Network**: Definition, purpose, maintenance strategies, examples.

### 5. Integration and Application Notes

* **Adapting to Mediums**: Digital, paper, hybrid. Compare strengths/weaknesses. Best practices.
* **Iterative Refinement**: Importance of review. Guidelines for periodic improvement.
* **Use Cases**: Academic, professional, creative. Templates or cases.
* **Scalability & Long-Term**: Challenges of large systems. Tools and strategies for sustainable organization.

### Suggested Workflow

1. Start with Core Notes.
2. Add Phase Notes.
3. Expand with Process Notes.
4. Add Component Notes.
5. Integrate Application Notes.

### Purpose of Documentation

Living system: refine through use, enable teaching and sharing, scale with growth.
