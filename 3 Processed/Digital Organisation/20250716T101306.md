**Folders vs. Labels in Proton Mail**

* **Folders**: Exclusive containers. One email = one folder. Use for primary categories (e.g., Finance, Legal, Clients, Receipts). These are final destinations.
* **Labels**: Non-exclusive overlays. Multiple labels per email. Use for status, priority, themes (e.g., Urgent, Awaiting Reply, Travel, Tax 2025).

**Operational Model**

* Inbox is transient, archive fast.
* Folders = end states after action.
* Labels = process tracking and cross-cutting themes.
* Example: Invoice → `/Finance/Invoices` folder + labels `Q3`, `Pending Payment`, `Client-X`.

**Why not only labels**

* Proton lacks Gmail-level automation. Labels-only approach drifts into disorder. Folders act as structural anchors.

**Implementation Tips**

* Automate with filters for folder/label assignment.
* Prefix labels for scale (`Status:Pending`, `Year:2025`).
* Avoid deep folder nesting; it hides context and slows filing.
* Don’t overload labels; keep them functional, not decorative.

**Bottom Line**
Folders enforce hierarchy and archiving discipline. Labels provide flexible overlays for workflow tracking. Hybrid model aligns with Proton’s interface limits and sustains clarity at volume.
