* Supporting points, quotes, data.
* Context: why relevant.

**Process (Engage)**

* Key questions.
* Analysis: reflections, assumptions, contradictions.
* Connections: links to other notes.

**Output (Apply)**

* Takeaways in 1–2 sentences.
* Applications: concrete steps.
* Impact on projects or decisions.

### 3. Examples

**Neural Plasticity**

* Input: brain’s ability to adapt; mechanisms include synaptic change and neurogenesis.
* Process: questions about mechanisms and learning; links to neurogenesis and cognitive resilience.
