# Lifecycle Spine (7 Stages + 1 Support)

**Guiding axioms**

* **Single-status rule**: A note exists in only one stage; moves are explicit.
* **Verb-driven names**: Folders describe the active process.
* **Shortest viable path**: Only seven lifecycle stages; tags/links cover everything else.
* **System vs. Content**: Operational files stay in `00_System`.

**Folder map**

```
00_System/     # templates, logs, snippets
01_Capture/    # just grabbed
02_Triage/     # deciding
03_Plan/       # committed
04_Work/       # actively shaping
05_Deliver/    # published/handed off
06_Learn/      # insights & retrospectives
07_Library/    # evergreen knowledge
98_Archive/    # >1y old or obsolete
```

**Optional sub-folders**: e.g. `Capture/Quick_Notes`, `Triage/Do_Now`, `Work/Drafting`, `Deliver/Reports`, `Learn/Reviews`, `Library/Concepts`. Only add when useful.

**Lifecycle flow**

```
Capture → Triage → Plan → Work → Deliver → Learn → Library → Archive
Triage → Library (reference only)
Deliver → Archive (>1y)
```

**Working example**

1. Jot → `Capture/`
2. Decide future article → `Plan/Projects/Article_AI/`
3. Draft → `Work/Drafting/Article_AI.md`
4. Publish → `Deliver/Articles/AI_article.pdf`
5. Retrospective → `Learn/Reviews/AI_article_retro.md`
6. Distill → `Library/Methods/Prompt_Engineering.md`
7. After one year → `Archive/Projects/`

**Why it works**

* Stages are mutually exclusive, exhaustive.
* Always a clear next move.
* Only seven top-level concepts to track.
* Git-friendly: mirrors real progress, minimal renames.
