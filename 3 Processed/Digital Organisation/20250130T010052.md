**Extended Cornell Note-Taking with a Fourth Section**

**Purpose**
Add a header section to set intentions before note-taking. It moves the system from reactive (recording) to proactive (guided by predefined objectives and questions).

**Contents of the Fourth Section**

1. **Title/Context** – Identify source (book, lecture, article) for easy retrieval.
2. **Goal/Objective** – State the precise learning aim for the session to filter content relevance.
3. **Key Questions** – List specific inquiries to focus attention and direct active information search.

**Advantages**

* **Targeted focus** – Filters irrelevant detail, keeps notes aligned with purpose.
* **Personalized learning** – Tailors content capture to individual objectives.
* **Intentional review** – Facilitates checking if goals were met and identifying follow-up research needs.

**Example**
Header:

```
Title: Time Management Strategies (Lecture)  
Goal: Learn strategies to improve daily time allocation.  
Questions: How to prioritize tasks? How to reduce distractions?  
```

Main Notes:

* Pomodoro: 25 min work + breaks.
* Eisenhower matrix: urgency vs. importance.
* Reduce distractions: environment control.

Cue Column:

* Adapt Pomodoro for longer focus blocks.
* Identify important but non-urgent tasks.
* List workspace adjustments.

Summary:
Pomodoro good for short tasks, less so for deep work. Eisenhower helps prioritize. Need to test workspace changes.

**Integration into Input → Process → Output Model**

* **Input**: Fourth section primes attention and goal alignment.
* **Process**: Cue column deepens reflection using initial questions.
* **Output**: Summary measures goal completion and identifies actions.

**Conclusion**
The fourth section strengthens intentionality and personal relevance, making Cornell notes a more strategic learning tool.
