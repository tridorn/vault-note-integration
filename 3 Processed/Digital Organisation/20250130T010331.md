# Purpose Sections in Notes

A **Purpose** should not be a generic “to describe and define \[topic]”. It must clarify *why* the note exists, what it is meant to do, and how it links to broader objectives.

---

### What the Purpose Should Do

1. **Relevance:** Explain why the concept matters.
2. **Intent/Use:** Specify whether it defines, analyzes, guides, or supports a process.
3. **Alignment:** Connect the note to larger goals, projects, or related notes.

### Structure Formula

**"To \[action/goal] \[specific focus] \[why it matters/its use]."**

* **Action/Goal:** describe, analyze, compare, evaluate, synthesize.
* **Focus:** definition, application, historical background, principles.
* **Utility:** foundation, clarification, decision-making aid.

### Examples

* **Generic:** To describe and define Pomodoro Technique.

* **Better:** To explain steps of the Pomodoro Technique, focusing on its productivity benefits and application in task management.

* **Generic:** To describe and define time blocking.

* **Better:** To outline principles of time blocking, compare with to-do lists, and guide its use in daily planning.

* **Generic:** To describe and define SWOT analysis.

* **Better:** To describe the structure of SWOT, its use in strategic planning, and illustrate with business applications.

### When Generic Purposes Work

Acceptable for:

* **Foundational notes:** simple reference definitions.
* **Linking notes:** placeholders pointing to deeper content.

In such cases, still sharpen the Purpose with specifics (e.g., “technical definition,” “baseline characteristics”).

---

### Refinement Guidelines

* **Ask:** Why does this note exist? What role does it play?
* **Focus on use cases:** How might the note be used later?
* **Add specificity:** Avoid “to describe and define” without context.
* **Connect to goals:** Position it within broader projects.

---

### Checklist

* **Clarity:** States subject and relevance.
* **Specificity:** Targets a defined aspect.
* **Relevance:** Ties into wider aims.
* **Actionable:** Indicates how it can be used.

---

### Avoid

* **Vagueness:** “To describe and define” without detail.
* **Overloading:** Purpose is not for full analysis.
* **Repetition:** Don’t restate the title.

---

### Recommendations

* Start with specificity, not generic phrasing.
* Refine Purpose after drafting the note if unclear.
* Keep it concise, informative, and tied to actual utility.
