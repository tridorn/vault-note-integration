**Condensed Formalized Note-Taking Framework**

**Phases**

1. **Harvesting** – Gather raw input from sources (books, lectures, brainstorming). Identify themes and questions.

   * *Processes*:

     * Source Identification – Select material.
     * Raw Extraction – Highlight, annotate, summarize initial impressions.
     * Theme Identification – Detect key ideas or patterns.

2. **Structuring** – Organize raw material into formal notes (e.g., Cornell Method) with objectives and summaries.

   * *Processes*:

     * Contextualization – Add Purpose, Goals, Key Questions.
     * Note Framing – Main notes, cue column, summary section.
     * Initial Reflection – Insights, links to other ideas.

3. **Synthesizing** – Distill structured notes into atomic, reusable knowledge blocks via Input → Process → Output.

   * *Processes*:

     * Atomic Breakdown – Isolate single concepts.
     * IPO Application – Capture Input, Process, Output.
     * Interlinking – Connect related concepts into a network.

**Core Components**

* **Objectives** – Purpose, Goals, Key Questions.
* **Harvest Notes** – Unstructured highlights and annotations.
* **Structured Notes** – Organized content with reflections and summaries.
* **Conceptual Notes** – Atomic, self-contained ideas with IPO format.
* **Knowledge Network** – Interlinked conceptual notes for long-term integration.

**Workflow Summary**

* **Harvesting**: Engage with source, extract key points, note themes.
* **Structuring**: Formalize Harvest Notes into Structured Notes, define objectives, contextualize.
* **Synthesizing**: Convert to Conceptual Notes, apply IPO, interlink into Knowledge Network.

**Example**

* *Harvesting*: Highlight “Pomodoro Technique uses 25-minute focus intervals.”
* *Structuring*: Cornell layout: keywords (“Pomodoro,” “Focus”), details, summary.
* *Synthesizing*: Conceptual Note – Input: “25-minute intervals,” Process: conditions of use, Output: plan for daily sessions.

**Strengths**

* Comprehensive: covers full note lifecycle.
* Modular: distinct, reusable parts.
* Scalable: works for simple and complex material.
