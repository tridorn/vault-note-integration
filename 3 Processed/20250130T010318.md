# Objectives Section: Role and Application

The **Objectives** section provides the framework for effective note-taking. It clarifies purpose, sets direction, and enables later application.

### Purpose

It answers three questions:

* **Why**: The broader reason for engaging with the material.
* **What**: Desired outcomes or questions to be answered.
* **How**: The way the note will shape understanding or action.

Its functions:

* **Focus**: Filters irrelevant detail.
* **Context**: Anchors notes within projects or goals.
* **Guidance**: Directs both engagement and later review.

### Timing

1. **Before Engagement (ideal)**: Define purpose, goals, and key questions to approach material intentionally.
2. **During Engagement**: Revise if insights shift direction.
3. **After Engagement**: Assess whether goals were met and note gaps.

### How It Guides

* **During note-taking**: Directs attention to relevant points.
* **In processing**: Frames analysis through key questions.
* **In outputs**: Ensures actionable insights link back to goals.
* **For future use**: Acts as a roadmap explaining why the note exists and how it connects to larger aims.

### Applications

* **Academic**: Align with exam or research objectives, highlight key theories and mechanisms.
* **Professional**: Tie learning to workplace problems, skills, and best practices.
* **Personal growth**: Define actionable self-improvement steps, not just reflection.
* **Creative/strategic projects**: Translate raw material into project goals and innovation questions.

### When to Consult

* While taking notes (maintain focus).
* During reviews (evaluate coverage and gaps).
* When linking notes (contextualize within larger systems).
* When applying insights (check alignment with objectives).

### Closing

The Objectives section is the compass of the note-taking process: it sets direction before, guides focus during, and validates outcomes after. Properly used, it keeps notes intentional, connected, and actionable.
