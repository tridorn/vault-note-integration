# Note-Taking Across Mediums

### 1. Books

* **Frameworks**: SQR3, Cornell Method, Input → Process → Output.
* **Pre**: Skim structure, form guiding questions.
* **During**: Active reading (seek answers to questions), Cornell layout for notes and cues.
* **Post**: Summarize in own words. Transfer into Obsidian:

  * **Input**: distilled insights.
  * **Process**: relate to questions, connect to other notes.
  * **Output**: actionable steps.

*Example*: Biases and groupthink distort decisions. → Frameworks can mitigate. → Apply by creating decision protocols.

### 2. Lectures / Classes

* **Frameworks**: Cornell, Feynman Technique, Input → Process → Output.
* **During**: Cornell—notes right side, cues left.
* **After**: Fill cues, write summary.
* **Post**: Explain concepts (Feynman), transfer into Obsidian with reflection and action items.

*Example*: Leadership = clarity + values. → Reflection: avoid micromanagement. → Output: vision document for next cycle.

### 3. Podcasts / Videos / Webinars

* **Frameworks**: Mind Mapping, Feynman, Zettelkasten.
* **During**: Build mind map of key concepts. Note striking insights.
* **After**: Explain to self (Feynman). Integrate into Zettelkasten with links.
* **Post**: Summarize, connect, list experiments.

*Example*: Productivity → Time-blocking, Deep Work. → Reserve 2hrs daily for Deep Work.

### 4. Conversations / Meetings / Interviews

* **Frameworks**: Cornell, SMART Goals, Input → Process → Output.
* **During**: Cornell for capturing points and open questions.
* **After**: Summarize key takeaways. Translate into SMART goals.
* **Post**: Consolidate in Obsidian, reflect, assign tasks with deadlines.

*Example*: Client shifts → update milestones, cross-team check-ins. SMART: weekly syncs, timeline by Friday.

### 5. Online Research / Articles

* **Frameworks**: SQR3, Zettelkasten, Input → Process → Output.
* **During**: Skim headings, form hypotheses. Note key data.
* **Post**: Break down into atomic notes, link into network. Summarize for clarity.
* **Output**: Apply to arguments or projects.

*Example*: Social engagement → driver of retention. → Plan: test polls, UGC, interactive posts.

### Core Principle

* Books → SQR3 + Cornell for comprehension.
* Lectures → Cornell + Feynman for understanding.
* Podcasts/Videos → Mind Maps + Zettelkasten for integration.
* Meetings → Cornell + SMART for action.
* Research → SQR3 + Zettelkasten for synthesis.
* Always cycle through **Input → Process → Output**.
