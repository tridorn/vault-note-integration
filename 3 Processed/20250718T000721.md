# Lifecycle Spine (7 stages + support)

**Axioms**

* **Single-status**: A note sits in exactly one stage; moves are explicit.
* **Verb-driven**: Folder names describe the current action.
* **Shortest path**: Seven stages only; links/tags handle the rest.
* **System vs. Content**: Operational files isolated in `00_System`.

**Folder Map**

```
00_System/   # templates, snippets, media, logs
01_Capture/  # just grabbed
02_Triage/   # deciding what it is
03_Plan/     # committed to act
04_Work/     # actively shaping
05_Deliver/  # done, published, handed off
06_Learn/    # extracting insights
07_Library/  # evergreen knowledge
98_Archive/  # cold storage (>1y finished/obsolete)
```

**Optional depth (use only if valuable)**

* Capture: Quick\_Notes, Web\_Clips, Voice\_Memos
* Triage: Do\_Now, Delegate, Defer, Reference
* Plan: Projects, Tasks, Schedules
* Work: Drafting, Research, Prototyping
* Deliver: Reports, Articles, Releases
* Learn: Journal, Reviews, Lessons
* Library: Concepts, Methods, Resources

**Lifecycle Flow**

* Capture → Triage → (Plan → Work → Deliver → Learn → Library)
* From Triage, reference-only notes go straight to Library.
* Deliver moves to Archive after one year.

**Example**

1. Idea in Capture
2. Triage → decide as article project
3. Work on draft
4. Deliver published PDF
5. Learn → retro notes
6. Library → distilled insights
7. After one year, Archive entire project

**Why effective**

* Mutually exclusive stages, no overlap.
* Predictable transitions.
* Only seven items to keep in mind.
* Git-friendly: history mirrors progress.
