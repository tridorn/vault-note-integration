# **Condensed Map of the Note-Taking System**

### **1. Overview Notes**

* **Purpose and Goals**: Define the system’s rationale and intended outcomes.
* **Three Phases**: Harvesting, Structuring, Synthesizing as the governing flow.
* **Integration of Tools**: Flexibility in methods (mind maps, linear notes, sketch notes).
* **Adapting Across Mediums**: Digital, analog, or hybrid implementation.

### **2. Phase Notes**

* **Harvesting**: Capturing raw input. Links to sources and harvesting processes.
* **Structuring**: Organizing into frameworks, adding context.
* **Synthesizing**: Refining into atomic, reusable knowledge units.

### **3. Process Notes**

**Harvesting**

* **Source Identification**: Prioritizing relevant material.
* **Raw Extraction**: Capturing highlights, annotations.
* **Theme Identification**: Recognizing patterns for structuring.

**Structuring**

* **Contextualization**: Purpose, goals, and guiding questions.
* **Framework Selection**: Choosing outlines, maps, etc.
* **Reflections & Summaries**: Adding insights and concise overviews.

**Synthesizing**

* **Atomic Breakdown**: Distilling single concepts.
* **IPO Application**: Input–Process–Output for reusable knowledge blocks.
* **Interlinking**: Connecting atomic notes into a knowledge network.

### **4. Component Notes**

* **Sources**: Types and engagement strategies.
* **Frameworks**: Organizational methods with strengths and trade-offs.
* **Objectives**: Purpose, goals, and guiding questions.
* **Harvest Notes**: Raw captured input.
* **Structured Notes**: Organized, contextualized material.
* **Conceptual Notes**: Atomic, interlinked knowledge units.
* **Knowledge Network**: Scalable web of conceptual notes.

### **5. Application Notes**

* **Use Cases**: Academic, professional, personal.
* **Workflow Templates**: Standardized step-by-step adoption.
* **Iterative Refinement**: Reviewing and improving notes over time.
* **Scalability & Long-Term Management**: Managing large volumes sustainably.
