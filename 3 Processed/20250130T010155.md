**Active Understanding in Obsidian: Core Structure**

**1. Layered Notes (Input → Process → Output)**

* **Input**: Rephrase key concepts into concise digests instead of copying verbatim. Forces immediate engagement.
* **Process**: Interrogate material without referencing the original. Use Feynman or Socratic techniques, add “Why?”/“How?” prompts, and tag (#critical\_thinking, #analysis).
* **Output**: Formulate conclusions, actionable insights, or applications. Use a dedicated “Application” or “Conclusion” section with #review for later revisits.

**2. Structured Templates**

* Templates guide every note through Summary, Questions, and Insights. Pre-fill prompts such as “How does this fit with what I already know?” and “What assumptions exist?”

**3. Mind Mapping and Linking**

* Use backlinks and graph view to connect each idea to existing notes, exposing patterns and dependencies.

**4. Active Recall**

* Apply spaced repetition via plugins like Obsidian Spaced Repetition to revisit processed notes at set intervals.

**5. Meta-Reflection Notes**

* For each domain, maintain a master note capturing the evolution of your thinking. Aggregate distilled insights from multiple notes over time.
