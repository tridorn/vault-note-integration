You could have more precisely asked: _"Design a minimal set of canonical working structures--e.g., folders, workstreams, or repositories--that Missions and other units can consistently operate within. They must prevent fragmentation, retain autonomy, and map cleanly to the artefact system."_

* * *

## PRINCIPLE

There is **one** canonical working container: the **Work Unit (WU)**.  
Every project, initiative, or mission-based execution operates inside a `WU`. It is:

- **modular** (can scale from 1 Cell to multi-Mission),
- **self-contained** (includes all canonical components),
- and **structurally consistent** (every WU is navigable by any role).

This **replaces** the idea of "a project folder," "a mission space," or "a deliverable repo." There is no other working base.

    └── README.md → Minimal index of ownership, purpose, status
    

**Each WU is version-controlled.**  
All canonical artefacts live within it. It is the **total domain of operation** for a Mission or unit. No canonical work happens outside this.

## CANONICAL WORKSTREAM TYPES (INSTANCES OF WU)

| Code | Workstream Type | Description | Typical Lifecycle | Execution Pattern | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **WU-PROJ** | **Project Work Unit** | Formal, scoped effort with multiple Missions | 6--18 weeks | Missions work in parallel, synced via Program | 
| **WU-MSN** | **Mission Work Unit** | Single Mission execution container | 6--12 weeks | 1 Mission owns full cycle; embeds MC, IC, PC | 
| **WU-RND** | **Research Work Unit** | Research + strategic insight collection | 4--8 weeks | No output expected; MC and SBs only | 
| **WU-SWP** | **Sweep / Fix Work Unit** | Tactical correction or Task Force action | 1--2 weeks | Minimal setup; DL + RS required | 
| **WU-SIM** | **Simulation Work Unit** | Planning, wargaming, or scenario stress-test | 2--6 weeks | Focused on Process Cards, MetricMap, MC | 
* * *

## CROSS-WU COHERENCE

To prevent fragmentation:

- All WUs are named as: `WU_<TYPE>-<SLUG>_<YYMMDD>`
- All link upward to a **Program Registry**, which references:

    - WU ID

    - Owner (Project Owner or Mission Commander)

    - Campaign ID

    - Active Status

    - Date of closure

No WU is left unmapped. If it's not in the registry, it does not exist.

* * *

## GOVERNANCE + AUTONOMY BALANCE

| Feature | Autonomy Preserved | Governance Enforced | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Artefact freedom** | Cells and Missions control _content_ of MC, DL, RS | Folder structure is fixed; artefacts must exist | 
| **Tooling** | Any tools permitted per ProcessCard | Canonical artefacts must be version-controlled | 
| **Review** | Mission owns review ritual | Submission to Program Board is fixed cadence | 
| **Start criteria** | Self-initiated WUs allowed (e.g., RND) | All WUs must have a valid InterfaceContract | 
* * *

## TACTICAL ENABLERS

- **WU templates**: CLI or GUI to scaffold compliant structure in <30 seconds
- **WU Linter**: script checks for canonical artefact presence, naming, completeness
- **WU Viewer**: UI shell that lets any actor navigate a WU's artefacts in one screen
* * *

## RESULT

- No unit can fragment--the structure is universal.
- Yet no unit is constrained--execution is fully free inside the WU shell.
- All artefacts are present. All roles know where to look. Nothing is invisible.

This is the operating system of the company.
