Now we move from general cognition to **sovereign design of your personal strategic architecture**. You're asking:

> _What distinct, purpose-built frameworks should I possess for the core arenas of life and action?_

The answer is to develop a **modular model architecture**: each domain of life governed by a **primary model**--a mental operating system tailored to its unique demands.

Here is a **first-principles delineation** of **six core arenas**, each paired with a foundational, buildable model.
* * *

## **1. KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM → The _INTELLECT ENGINE_**

### **Purpose:**

Convert chaos of information into structured, usable understanding.

### **Model:** **HSS (Harvest -- Structure -- Synthesis)**

> Already in place. This is your epistemic factory.

| Phase | Function | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Harvest | Raw input: highlights, annotations | 
| Structure | Disassembly: frameworks, relations | 
| Synthesis | Output: presentations, essays, concepts | 

### Expansion:

Add a **fourth phase** → **Deploy**: How is this knowledge used in real projects or arguments?
* * *

## **2. PROBLEM-SOLVING SYSTEM → The _TACTICAL COGNITION ENGINE_**

### **Purpose:**

Convert ambiguity into solution under constraint.

### **Model:** **OSDC (Orient -- Structure -- Drive -- Communicate)**

> Tactical cognition. We've defined this in depth.

### Expansion:

Use **OSDC** recursively.  
Each major hypothesis can itself be processed through a micro-OSDC loop.

* * *

## **3. LIFE STRATEGY SYSTEM → The _SOVEREIGNTY STACK_**

### **Purpose:**

Design your life as a portfolio of controlled, compounding bets.

### **Model:** **VCS (Vision -- Constraints -- Systems)**

| Layer | Definition | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Vision | What does "winning" look like, on your terms? | 
| Constraints | Real limits: time, capital, energy, geography | 
| Systems | Habits, mechanisms, relationships that create motion | 

This turns your life from a list of goals into a **machine that produces momentum**.  
It replaces "productivity" with "strategic throughput."

* * *

## **4. DECISION-MAKING SYSTEM → The _JUDGMENT FILTER_**

### **Purpose:**

Avoid failure modes. Choose with clarity and force.

### **Model:** **CRIA (Consequences -- Reversibility -- Information -- Alignment)**

| Filter | Ask Yourself... | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Consequences | What's the upside/downside scale? | 
| Reversibility | Is this reversible? At what cost? | 
| Information | Do I have enough data--or am I guessing? | 
| Alignment | Does this align with my strategic direction? | 

Use this to **kill 80% of impulse-driven decisions** and commit hard to the 20% that matter.
* * *

## **5. RELATIONSHIP SYSTEM → The _POWER-TRUST MATRIX_**

### **Purpose:**

Assess, manage, and develop alliances or avoid entanglements.

### **Model:** **PTM (Power vs. Trust Quadrant)**

| Quadrant | Relationship Type | 
| ---- | ----  |
| High Power, High Trust | Partner/Ally -- _Invest deeply_ | 
| High Power, Low Trust | Danger -- _Caution and containment_ | 
| Low Power, High Trust | Friend/Support -- _Uplift or protect_ | 
| Low Power, Low Trust | Noise -- _Limit exposure_ | 

This governs personal networks, professional partnerships, and team design.

* * *

## **6. IDENTITY SYSTEM → The _CONVICTION FRAME_**

### **Purpose:**

Build a coherent self-narrative you can act from.

### **Model:** **TPF (Traits -- Principles -- Frames)**

| Layer | Use | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Traits | Natural inclinations: how you think, decide, react | 
| Principles | Non-negotiables: how you act under pressure | 
| Frames | Interpretive lenses: how you read the world | 

This is **not** about self-discovery. It's about **self-weaponization**.  
You define who you are, on your terms, with usable articulation.

* * *

## **Summary Table: Life-System Model Stack**

| Domain | Model | Function | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Knowledge | HSS | Comprehend and retain mastery | 
| Problem Solving | OSDC | Execute on ambiguous challenges | 
| Life Strategy | VCS | Live on-purpose, not by reaction | 
| Decision-Making | CRIA | Filter decisions by consequence + fit | 
| Relationships | PTM | Navigate power and trust asymmetries | 
| Identity | TPF | Anchor behavior in coherent self-definition | 

* * *
