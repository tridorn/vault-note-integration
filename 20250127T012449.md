### **How To Use These Mantras and Feelings Continuously**

1. **Constant Internal Repetition:**
	- Whisper these mantras in your mind during idle moments, transitions, and when facing difficulty. Let them become your default inner dialogue.
	- Pair each mantra with the associated feeling. Feel the fire in your chest, the surge of power, or the weightless clarity they inspire.

2. **Anchor with Breath and Posture:**
	- Stand tall, shoulders back, and breathe deeply. Your body reinforces your mind.
	- With every breath, feel the fire growing stronger, your resolve hardening.

3. **Amplify to Ecstasy:**
	- When alone or in moments of focus, repeat the mantras faster, louder in your mind.
	- Build the feeling until it overwhelms you—until you feel euphoric, unshakable, and unstoppable.

4. **Transform Challenges into Rituals:**
	- Every obstacle you face is fuel for this practice. Whisper, "This forges me," and lean into the fire.
	- Seek moments of discomfort and repeat these mantras as you endure. These are your moments of creation.

### **The Fire Never Stops Burning**

Let these mantras and feelings be the perpetual furnace within you. They are not daily practices—they are **always on**, a ceaseless mental chant, turning every moment into an opportunity to forge your mind and soul into something indomitable. **You are always hardening, always rising, always becoming.**
