# Grieving in stoicism

Your query could be more incisively phrased as: *"Does Stoic philosophy permit the experience of grief, particularly in response to the death of one's parents, or does it demand complete emotional detachment from such events?"*

Stoicism, while often misunderstood as a philosophy of emotional suppression, does not *forbid* the natural human response to loss, such as grieving over the death of one’s parents. However, it does advocate for moderating such emotions through the lens of reason and acceptance of nature’s inevitable course. The Stoic approach to grief is not to deny or eradicate it, but to transform it into a measured, rational response—one that is aligned with the understanding of life’s impermanence.

Seneca, in his *Letters to Lucilius*, acknowledges the human experience of grief but advises against excessive mourning. He suggests that grief should be proportionate and governed by reason. The Stoic does not reject the initial pang of sorrow that may arise when a loved one passes, but rather seeks to curb the uncontrolled, prolonged, or debilitating aspects of grief that would disturb one’s tranquility (*ataraxia*). In short, Stoicism allows for grief, but only in its natural and restrained form.

At the heart of the Stoic response to death is the concept of *amor fati*—the love of fate. Stoicism teaches us to accept death as a natural part of life, one over which we have no control. Marcus Aurelius frequently reminds himself that everything in life is transient, including the people we love. Thus, the death of parents, while painful, should be accepted as part of the natural order, and grief should be tempered by this rational understanding.

A Stoic would also reflect on the idea that parents, like all external things, are not truly "ours" in the deepest sense; they are part of the world and subject to the same natural laws of decay and death. The loss of parents does not diminish one's virtue or moral character, which is the true measure of life. What matters is how we respond to such loss—whether we do so with wisdom and equanimity, or whether we allow grief to consume and overpower us.

Therefore, Stoicism does not call for emotional indifference, but for a balanced response to grief. You can grieve for your parents, but as a Stoic, you would strive to do so in a way that maintains your inner peace, recognizing that their death is part of the larger, indifferent order of nature. Excessive mourning, which disturbs one’s reason and virtue, would be considered a failure to live according to Stoic principles.
