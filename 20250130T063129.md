Certainly! Let's create an **extensive and complete system of Smart Lists in Apple Reminders**, focusing primarily on your **GTD contexts** and combining them with factors like **priority**, **due date**, and **flagging**. This setup will help you efficiently discover what to do next based on your current context while still allowing you to review standalone factors when needed.
