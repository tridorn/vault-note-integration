Better: "Starting with a German UG, intending to relocate abroad in a few years. What measures and documentation should I prepare now to reduce exit tax risk and procedural friction, and which advisers should I engage?"

  

Here's the unvarnished framework. Germany's rules around entrepreneurial emigration are aggressive, and they're being tightened in precisely the scenario you're anticipating.

  

1. Core risk: § 6 AStG (Wegzugsbesteuerung)

If you hold ≥1% in a corporation (UG, GmbH) and become non-resident for tax purposes, Germany deems you to have sold your shares at fair market value and taxes latent gains at your personal capital gains rate (~26.375% plus solidarity, potentially plus church tax).

• The tax is triggered by change of residence to a non-EU/EEA jurisdiction (Dubai, Singapore, etc.) unless very specific deferral rules apply.

• Since the 2021 reform, indefinite deferral is gone; even within the EU/EEA you now face a seven-year deferral limit, with annual reporting obligations. Outside the EU/EEA, payment is generally due immediately.

  

Implication: If your UG grows materially before exit, you could face a six- or seven-figure liquidity problem without an actual sale.

2. Early actions to limit exposure

- Cap the value at exit: Either exit early before valuation multiplies, or transfer shares before they appreciate (but beware anti-avoidance rules on undervaluation and related-party transfers).
- Separate the future growth vehicle: Incorporate a foreign holdco now and have that, not you personally, hold new ventures. Keep the German UG as a bounded, low-growth shell you can wind down or sell domestically before leaving.
- Document non-tax motives: In case of audit, keep records of genuine business and personal reasons for relocation, contract opportunities in the new jurisdiction, customer proximity, investor requirements, etc. Tax authorities will probe intent.
- Economic substance: If you later run the business from abroad, ensure real board meetings, contracts, and decision-making occur outside Germany to avoid "effective place of management" risk keeping the UG taxable in Germany.

3. Documentation to build now

- Shareholder agreements and valuations: Keep annual third-party or documented internal valuations of the UG; contemporaneous data is critical if you argue a lower value at exit.
- Board minutes and operational records: Show where management is located and decisions are made over time.
- Contracts and market mapping: Evidence that future relocation is driven by commercial scale, partners, or capital markets, not just tax.
- Personal ties and centre of life: Track ties to Germany (property, family, memberships); reducing these before exit supports non-residency status and avoids "extended limited tax liability" traps.

4. Advisers you need

- Experienced Steuerberater with international/exit tax focus: Many German accountants know compliance, few know structuring. You need one familiar with § 6 AStG, treaty overrides, and corporate reorganisations.
- Fachanwalt für Steuerrecht (tax lawyer): For planning share transfers, pre-move restructurings, or disputes. The Steuerberater handles filings; the lawyer handles structural moves and legal risk.
- Valuation specialist: Neutral appraiser to substantiate share values at relevant points.
- Foreign counsel: In your destination jurisdiction, for incorporation, tax residency rules, and corporate governance in sync with your exit plan.

5. Procedural steps as departure nears

- Residence deregistration (Abmeldung): Do this with the Bürgeramt; it's the formal trigger for non-residency, but not decisive alone.
- Final tax return (Wegzugsbesteuerung): File with valuation, request instalment options if any apply (often denied outside EU/EEA).
- Dividend or liquidation planning: Distribute retained earnings before departure if rates are lower now; balance against § 6 AStG exposure.
* * *

6. Strategic options before leaving

- Asset swap / holding restructure: Contribute UG shares into a foreign corporation now, before growth; potential German tax deferral if structured within EU/EEA and timed before anti-abuse tests bite.
- Step-up valuation: Introduce outside investors or recapitalise at current value to fix the tax base.
- Winding down UG: If the UG isn't needed, close it before exit; liquidation taxed at capital gains rates may be preferable to exit tax on higher valuations.

If you want, I can map out a timeline from now to relocation with concrete actions by quarter, so you reduce exposure and keep every step well-documented before the Finanzamt takes an interest. That would turn this into a low-risk, predictable migration instead of a liquidity shock.
