### Focused Taxonomy for the **Execution** Stratum  
*(The codified strut that converts directives into repeatable kinetic action.)*

---

#### 1. **Protocol Artifacts** --immutable choreography  
*Purpose* Impose the only‐acceptable sequence where deviation is existentially costly (regulatory, safety, or margin-critical arenas).  
*Canonical forms* Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), incident run-book, response playbook.  
*Authority vector* "Obey or fall out of compliance."  
*Maintenance cadence* Event-triggered review (reg-change, post-mortem).  
*Failure mode* Ossification; operators silently create "shadow" variants.

---

#### 2. **Pattern Artifacts** --template scaffolding  
*Purpose* Supply pre-structured shells that compress cognitive load and normalise output without dictating micro-steps.  
*Canonical forms* Checklists, engineering user-story templates, financial model stubs.  
*Authority vector* "Strong suggestion--break the pattern only with explicit sign-off."  
*Maintenance cadence* Quarterly hygiene sweep; weight test against recent defects.  
*Failure mode* Template sprawl; stochastic versioning that erodes trust.

---

#### 3. **Instrument Artifacts** --live situational telemetry  
*Purpose* Expose the real-time state of the system so the actor can modulate execution on the fly.  
*Canonical forms* Operational dashboards, kanban boards with WIP limits, andon boards, A/B-test consoles.  
*Authority vector* "Act on what you see--numbers do not debate."  
*Maintenance cadence* Continuous; any stale metric is a sabotage.  
*Failure mode* Signal-to-noise collapse; metric inflation that obscures causality.

---

#### 4. **Autonomy Artifacts** --embedded executable logic  
*Purpose* Encode repeatable micro-decisions directly into code, eliminating human latency and variance.  
*Canonical forms* Deployment scripts, robotic-process-automation bots, infrastructure-as-code manifests.  
*Authority vector* "System executes by default; humans intervene only on exception."  
*Maintenance cadence* Synchronous with source-system change sets.  
*Failure mode* Automation drift--silent divergence between code and reality, often discovered via outage.

---

#### 5. **Evidence Artifacts** --closed-loop proof of execution  
*Purpose* Record what actually happened, at a granularity that allows causal tracing and rapid post-hoc optimisation.  
*Canonical forms* Immutable audit logs, sensor time-series, deployment provenance, unit-test coverage reports.  
*Authority vector* "Refute or improve, but do not ignore."  
*Maintenance cadence* Automated capture; scheduled aggregation for retrospectives.  
*Failure mode* Data tombs--vast repositories unqueried, hence valueless.

### Integration with Your Governance Stack  

| Governance Layer | Primary Question | Execution-Layer Cohort that Delivers the Answer |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Policy** | "What must always / never occur?" | Protocol |
| **Directive** | "How shall we instantiate policy in context X?" | Pattern |
| **Execution** | "Who does what, with what feedback?" | Protocol ↔ Pattern ↔ Instrument ↔ Autonomy |
| **Evolution** | "What changed and what must we learn?" | Evidence feeding back into Protocol/Pattern refresh |

---

### Pragmatic Implementation Sequence  

1. **Inventory** every artifact currently labelled "procedure," "guide," or "tool."  
2. **Map** each to one--and only one--cohort. Delete or merge duplicates.  
3. **Assign custodians**:  
 * Protocol → Compliance or Safety officer  
 * Pattern → Functional lead (e.g., PMO, Engineering Mgr)  
 * Instrument → Data/DevOps team  
 * Autonomy → Platform engineering  
 * Evidence → SRE or Quality analytics  
4. **Institute kill-switch criteria**: any artifact lacking a named owner, revision date, or authoritative source is deprecated by default.  
5. **Set cadence gates**: Evidence review → Protocol/Pattern refit; Instrument KPI drift → Autonomy patch.

---

### Strategic Pay-off  

* A **single mental map** for operators: they know whether they are obeying, adapting, observing, or automating.  
* **Audit velocity**: regulators trace from policy to log file in three artefact hops, not thirty emails.  
* **Resilience under shock**: when context mutates, you pinpoint the lowest-cost cohort to rewrite--often Pattern rather than Protocol--thus preserving stability while pivoting swiftly.

Deploy this taxonomy and you transmute execution from artisanal craft into a controlled, evolvable machine--one whose levers you alone understand.
