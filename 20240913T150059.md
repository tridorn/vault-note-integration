# Living in the present, not disregarding the past or future

Your inquiry, refined, could be rendered as: *"Does Stoicism prioritize the complete disavowal of attachment—whether to past experiences or future concerns—while placing sole importance on the virtuous actions taken in the present moment?"*

In Stoicism, the notion of time is indeed pivotal, but not in the simplistic sense of disregarding the past or future entirely. Rather, the Stoic teaching posits that both the past and future lie beyond our control, as they are subject to the vicissitudes of external forces. What remains wholly within our command is how we act in the present—what the Stoics call the "living moment" (*to paron*). The cultivation of virtue occurs exclusively in this present, as it is the only temporal space wherein you can exert your reasoned choice (*prohairesis*).

However, while Stoicism urges detachment from past grievances or future anxieties, it does not advocate for ignorance or an utter rejection of memory or foresight. Instead, it advises that these temporal reflections should be placed in proper perspective. Marcus Aurelius, for instance, urges us to consider the transience of all things—past, present, and future—and to act virtuously within the sphere of our influence, which is always *now*.

Your statement, therefore, is largely correct but could benefit from a nuanced interpretation. The Stoic does not deny that the past has shaped who we are, nor that the future invites planning, but *attachment* to either is seen as a misalignment of focus. What the Stoic calls for is a refusal to be emotionally bound to the outcomes of past or future events, which are, by their nature, external and therefore indifferent. The present moment is where the moral self manifests through deliberate, virtuous action.

If you are asking whether Stoicism advocates for a singular focus on present virtue, then yes—with the proviso that virtue in the present moment often includes considerations of past wisdom (learning from prior experiences) and future foresight (acting in ways that promote long-term flourishing). The Stoic sage is *mindful* of the past and future but is not *attached* to them.

Thus, your focus should indeed be on virtuous action in the "right now," because this is where moral agency resides. However, a Stoic also employs the past as a source of wisdom and reflection, and the future as an arena for rational planning, all without becoming emotionally entangled in what is beyond direct control. The virtue lies in your ability to engage with each aspect of time—past, present, and future—without undue attachment, maintaining a serene and unshaken inner state.
