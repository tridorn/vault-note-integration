### Expansion Slots -- Ten Novel Constructs Worth Prototyping

| # | Concept (codename) | Essence | Target Buyer | Leverage Path | Revenue Logic | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 1 | **AI Concierge Node** | Always-on Slack / WhatsApp bot fine-tuned on the client's own SOPs; answers staff queries, pushes reminders, escalates anomalies. | 100-250 FTE firms with thin middle management | Uses AuditOps data lake → ProductOps builds bot wrapper | Seat licence €19-49/mo + setup €2 k | 
| 2 | **Process Bounty Board** | Public list of micro-inefficiencies (≤1 h/day waste) crowdsourced from SME owners; you pick high-value ones, solve, then publish a Best-Practice Map. | Your own lead pool | Generates validated pains on demand | Free to post → lead funnel; solutions upsell | 
| 3 | **Compliance-as-Code Vault** | YAML/Git-style repo of ISO, GDPR, ESG clauses mapped to executable Make.com workflows and Notion templates. | Quality managers, compliance officers | DataOps + BizOps convert static regs into scripts | Annual licence €3 k + support retainer | 
| 4 | **One-Hour Automation Clinic** | Live, time-boxed Zoom teardown of one SME process; you build a quick automation while owner watches. | Skeptical owners | Uses VisualOps stream + ProductOps snippets | €450 per session → funnels to Automation Sprint | 
| 5 | **Succession Value Simulator** | Interactive web tool: adjust EBITDA, documentation score, digital maturity → shows enterprise value delta. | Ageing Mittelstand owners | Built by WebOps; inputs feed into AuditOps pitch | Free tool; contact gate for SuccessionGrid | 
| 6 | **Knowledge Insurance Policy** | Annual service: capture critical know-how on video + Notion, store encrypted off-site; guarantees access if key employee leaves. | Craft firms, niche manufacturers | VisualOps filming + BizOps structuring | €4 k setup + €1 k/year storage & update | 
| 7 | **Template-as-a-Service Feed** | Weekly push of micro-templates (zap, Notion block, Framer section) delivered via Git-style feed; subscribers slot them directly. | Tech-curious SMEs, indie founders | ProductOps maintains repo; GrowthOps markets | SaaS, €29/mo; upsell to implementation | 
| 8 | **ROI-Stamped Deliverables** | Each project PDF or dashboard carries an embedded live widget showing hours/cost saved to date, pulled from client data. | Existing service clients | DataOps builds widget; drives retention proof | Increases retainer stickiness → churn ↓ | 
| 9 | **Ghostwriter Deck Engine** | Voice-to-investor-deck pipeline: founder records 10-min monologue, GPT drafts deck, DeckOps polishes. | Seed founders, accelerators | Extends DeckOps; uses your markdown site backend | €900 fixed -- margins >70 % | 
| 10 | **Trade-Guild Content Syndicate** | You license bespoke Best-Practice Maps to multiple regional chambers/trade guilds under white label. | Handwerks- & Industrie-kammern | VisualOps re-brands, BizOps contracts | Per-guild licence €2-5 k/year |

**Implementation Guidance**

1. **Prototype one concept per quarter**--tie it to an existing Ops unit to avoid capacity overrun.

2. **Instrument each with hard KPIs** (lead volume, conversion rate, MRR) before scaling.

3. **Archive or spin-off quickly** if a concept fails the 90-day traction test; keep the IP in the vault for later remix.

With this portfolio you add defensible IP, recurring revenue hooks, and differentiated trust signals--without compromising lean headcount.
