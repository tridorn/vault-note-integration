Let's create a grand, centralized layout for The Sundered Bay that not only serves as the gateway to the new continent but also provides a natural hub for settlement, exploration, and expansion. Here’s how the geography and key features would be organized to make this basin the focal point for trade, settlement, and eventually, civilization:

### Geographic and Strategic Layout

1. **The Inland Sea Basin as a Natural Gateway**
	- The inland sea serves as a vast, protected harbor surrounded by mountains on three sides, which gently slope down into fertile lowlands.
	- This inland sea becomes the primary point of entry for anyone arriving from the old kingdom and the central point from which all exploration and settlement radiate.
	- The inland sea is large enough to support multiple cities, but the new lord could designate a primary port city, strategically positioned at the mouth of the **Great River**, the continent's largest and most fertile river.

2. **The Great River of the Continent**
	- **Source**: The Great River originates from a prominent natural feature—an immense, elevated mesa or plateau that stands alone in the center of the continent, known as **The Sky Pillar**.
	- **Course**: From The Sky Pillar, the river winds for hundreds of miles through lush valleys and fertile plains, gradually widening as it flows toward the inland sea.
	- **Drainage**: The river drains directly into the inland sea, creating a fertile delta and a natural harbor where river trade can easily converge with maritime trade, making this spot ideal for a capital city and major trade hub.

3. **The Sky Pillar: The Central Landmark**
	- The Sky Pillar is an isolated, towering plateau or mesa rising dramatically from the flat plains around it. Visible from miles away, it has become a natural landmark for settlers and traders.
	- This massive geological feature is rich with resources (metals, rare stones) and is strategically defensible, making it an ideal site for a capital city. At the top of the mesa, an expansive flat area allows for the construction of a fortified city and, perhaps, a palace or seat of governance.
	- **Symbolic Significance**: As the tallest feature on the continent, the Sky Pillar could symbolize the ambition of the new settlement and be visible to all approaching the inland sea.

4. **The Continent’s Size and Habitation**
	- The continent is vast, roughly the size of Eurasia, and largely uninhabited except for a few small, scattered tribes along the coasts and in isolated inland regions.
	- This gives settlers a virtually blank canvas for establishing new cities, developing farmlands, and building trade routes.
	- The terrain is varied, with fertile plains, rolling hills, and thick forests surrounding the Sky Pillar and extending toward the inland sea. Beyond the basin, the continent stretches outward into massive unexplored forests, mountain ranges, deserts, and even potentially other inland seas or massive river systems.

5. **Natural Convergence of Trade Routes**
	- **Land Trade**: The Great River provides a natural trade route connecting the inland sea to the Sky Pillar and the fertile lands around it. Settlements would logically emerge along the river, creating a chain of towns leading to the basin.
	- **River Transport**: The Great River, navigable for much of its length, serves as the main artery for inland trade. Goods from the interior can be loaded onto barges and shipped downriver to the inland sea, where they can be further distributed by sea.
	- **Maritime Trade**: The strait to the ocean is fortified and becomes a toll point for all maritime trade, and a few minor rivers that flow from the mountains into the inland sea facilitate further expansion and exploration around the basin.

### Potential for a Thriving Capital and Major Settlement

1. **Capital City on the Delta**: The delta where the Great River drains into the inland sea becomes the site of the capital city. Known as **Delta’s Gate** or **Skyharbor**, this city sits at the mouth of the river, with easy access to both the river and the inland sea. Its fertile location makes it a major agricultural hub and an ideal point for river trade and exports from the continent.
	
2. **Secondary Fortified Settlement at The Sky Pillar**:
	- A secondary, fortified city can be built atop the Sky Pillar, functioning as a strategic and symbolic capital. From here, the new lord and their descendants could govern the continent, commanding an impressive view of the surrounding lands.
	- This city, called **Highspire** or **Skyhold**, would be a center for governance, law, and culture. As a safe retreat and a natural fortress, it serves as a place of power, easily defended from any potential threats.

3. **Settler Network Along the River and Basin**: Smaller settlements will naturally pop up along the Great River, creating a thriving network of villages, towns, and trade outposts. This provides the infrastructure for farming, resource extraction, and eventually manufacturing and artisanal goods, feeding the demand of the capital city and creating self-sustaining communities.

### Strategic and Economic Importance

1. **Convergence of Inland and Maritime Trade**: The inland sea and the Great River make the basin a natural hub, where all trade from the continent’s interior can meet maritime traders from the old kingdom. This convergence provides unmatched economic advantages, as goods from the continent flow into the capital and onto ships bound for the wider world.

2. **Agricultural and Natural Wealth**: The river delta and surrounding plains offer immense agricultural potential, and the basin itself is surrounded by forests, mineral-rich mountains, and even rare geothermal hot springs. This natural wealth will quickly draw settlers, artisans, and merchants, transforming the basin into a bustling center of activity.

3. **Fortification of the Strait and Control of the Trade Route**: By fortifying the strait, the new lord has direct control over access to the inland sea and, therefore, the entire basin’s trade. This chokepoint becomes a strategic asset, generating income from tolls and fees and allowing for safe passage in an otherwise dangerous sea.

### Distances and Further Context

1. **Distance to the Old Kingdom**: The Sundered Bay is about 400-500 miles from the old kingdom across the sea. The maritime route takes 2-3 days of sailing with favorable winds, giving it a balance of isolation and accessibility.
	
2. **Scale of the Continent**: The continent is vast, with the inland sea and basin positioned in the eastern region, about 700-800 miles from coast to coast and extending thousands of miles from north to south. Settlement will likely radiate outward from the inland sea, with exploration focusing on the regions surrounding the Great River and The Sky Pillar.

3. **Expansion Potential**: The vast size of the continent offers limitless potential for exploration and settlement. The basin’s central location on the eastern coast makes it the ideal entry point, from which expeditions can push further inland to explore and claim new territories, gradually expanding the influence of the basin and its capital.

### Summary

With the inland sea and Great River as natural routes, The Sundered Bay becomes the gateway to this massive, uncharted continent. The Sky Pillar serves as a symbolic and strategic high ground for governance, and the basin’s fertile delta establishes it as a trade and settlement center. The new lord’s control over the strait solidifies their economic power, and over time, the basin will likely grow into the most prosperous and culturally significant hub on the continent, drawing people, wealth, and influence.
