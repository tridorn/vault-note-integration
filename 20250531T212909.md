**Clarification**: A more precise formulation would have been, _"Assess the functional viability and strategic implications of replacing the CEO with a multi-role Leadership Council, governed by decentralized decision-making principles such as Auftragstaktik."_

**Second-Level Assessment:**

### Structural Analysis

This variant does not merely lack a CEO--it instantiates a **collegial oligarchy** with strategic command responsibilities distributed across defined domains. The configuration attempts to blend military-style mission command (Auftragstaktik) with corporate governance. The framing suggests a bias toward _strategic deliberation over executive centralization_.

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike na√Øve committee-based governance, your model assigns **distinct, sovereign domains of authority**, thereby avoiding total diffusion of power. This makes it structurally more viable, but not free of dysfunction risk.

* * *

### Strategic Merits

**1. Cognitive Diversity at the Strategic Level**  
Each council member has clear epistemic ownership of a distinct domain, reducing echo-chamber risks and increasing scenario coverage in planning. This can enhance **strategic optionality**, if and only if the group maintains _cross-domain strategic literacy_ (i.e., they understand each other's levers and constraints).

**2. Auftragstaktik Applied**  
Mission-type tactics require:

- Clarity of intent at the top.
- High trust and competence at all levels.
- A culture that tolerates intelligent deviation from orders in dynamic contexts.

Transposing this into corporate governance is ambitious. It will work only if the Leadership Council aligns tightly on **intent, boundaries, and escalation triggers**. Otherwise, autonomy devolves into fragmentation.

**3. Operational Downflow**  
Pushing execution downward limits micromanagement, speeds operational decision cycles, and allows the Leadership Council to remain strategically focused. This is _advisable_, provided that lower layers are staffed with operators capable of independent judgment.

* * *

### Structural Risks

**1. Strategic Incoherence via Misaligned Doctrines**  
Without a singular CEO arbitrating between competing domain priorities, there is a latent risk of **strategic drift**, particularly during periods of internal resource tension (e.g. growth vs. consolidation, innovation vs. scale).

The CVO and CSO roles, while distinct, are prone to ideological tension--vision vs. realism. Conflict resolution will depend on either pre-negotiated doctrines or de facto hierarchy, which may emerge informally.

**2. Crisis Latency**  
In the absence of a strong integrative authority, crises tend to either:

- provoke paralysis through consensus-seeking, or
- trigger power centralization _post hoc_ under whoever acts fastest.

You will need to design **crisis-time override protocols**, with temporary delegation of unified executive power, or the system will fail under volatility.

**3. Accountability Dilution**  
While domain heads can be held accountable within their spheres, system-wide failure becomes difficult to attribute. This leads to **risk externalization**--each domain optimizes locally, assuming someone else is managing the whole.

You must build a **feedback architecture** (e.g. cross-domain diagnostics, postmortems, strategy audits) to surface and correct misalignments early.
* * *

### Functional Typology

The system is technocratic in method, oligarchic in structure, and mission-driven in ethos. Its performance hinges on:

- Internal coherence (shared doctrine + shared strategic literacy)
- External adaptability (tolerance for ambiguity + decisive override under pressure)

**Under stable, long-horizon conditions**, it is optimal for complex, intellectual enterprises--e.g., advanced R&D, strategy-intensive SaaS, think tanks.

**Under high volatility or when ruthless execution is required**, it lacks the centralizing force that a wartime CEO embodies.

* * *

### Recommendation

**Deploy with constraints.** This structure is viable if:

1. You **codify decision rights** and authority overlaps ex ante, including what _requires_ Council consensus vs. domain autonomy.

2. You establish **temporary executive authority** mechanisms for urgent, integrative action.

3. You enforce **ritualised strategic convergence** (e.g., quarterly doctrinal reviews) to recalibrate alignment.

Otherwise, you risk elegant dysfunction: an intelligent, well-staffed council that spends too long aligning and too little time executing under time pressure.

This is a structure for strategic depth, not for pace. Match it to the operating environment accordingly.
