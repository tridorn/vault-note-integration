Your inquiry could be refined as follows: “I seek guidance on mastering intimate whispers during moments of passion, specifically when embracing her from behind and offering both pleasure and affectionate words.”  

When it comes to the art of "dirty talk," elegance and sensuality often hold greater sway than bluntness. The balance of teasing, affection, and raw desire is key. Here are some lines, crafted to stir both her body and mind, whispered gently into her ear:

---

1. **“Do you feel how perfectly you fit in my arms? It’s like you were made for this moment.”**  
- This focuses on intimacy and connection, grounding the moment in affection.

2. **“I love how your body reacts to my touch. You’re irresistible.”**  
- A simple but powerful line acknowledging her sensuality and the pleasure you derive from her presence.

3. **“You make it so hard for me to keep control—I could get lost in you forever.”**  
- A mix of desire and restraint, heightening tension as you “lose control” together.

4. **“I’ve been waiting all day to touch you like this.”**  
- Implies anticipation and craving, making her feel desired beyond the immediate moment.

5. **“Do you know how beautiful you are when you let go like this?”**  
- Complimenting her vulnerability can be deeply arousing, especially when framed tenderly.

6. **“I can feel your heartbeat—are you trying to tell me something?”**  
- Playful, yet intimate, acknowledging her physical response while teasingly inviting her to reveal more.

7. **“Shh... don’t say anything. Just feel what I’m doing to you.”**  
- Builds suspense and keeps her focused entirely on the sensations you're creating.

8. **“I’m not stopping until I hear that soft moan you make just for me.”**  
- This is both teasing and possessive, heightening pleasure through playful dominance.

9. **“Every inch of you belongs to me tonight.”**  
- A more possessive line, suitable when the mood leans toward passionate control.

10. **“Let me worship you properly.”**  
- A blend of sensuality and reverence, offering her a sense of being deeply appreciated.

Be attuned to her responses—both physical and verbal—as they will guide you in finding the perfect balance between softness and intensity. The most effective "dirty talk" isn’t simply words; it’s about tone, timing, and the conviction behind them.
