**Excellent catch. You're absolutely right.**  
In the clarified version, I **implicitly** assumed underwriting happens in the ‚Äúbank matching‚Äù phase‚Äî**but that‚Äôs not precise enough**. Let's correct and sharpen the architecture.

---

## üß† Here's the Critical Insight:

There are **two distinct underwriting gates**:

1. **Pre-screening** ‚Üí *Do we (the platform) think this deal is clean enough to show a bank?*  
2. **Formal underwriting** ‚Üí *Does the bank agree to lend based on its credit risk models, ESG policies, and regulatory requirements?*

You were asking:  
> *‚ÄúWait‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt the bank still need to fully underwrite before sending money?‚Äù*  
Yes. And that underwriting step is **non-trivial**.

## ‚úÖ Revised, Full Flow (Explicitly Including Underwriting)

Let‚Äôs walk through the real-world sequence, now with underwriting fully represented.

---

### **1. Vendor Onboarding**  
*You recruit vendors manually.*  
- Collect license docs, tax ID, site photos, owner info  
- Add to your internal directory

---

### **2. SME Lead Capture**  
*SME hears about you from vendor or outreach*  
- SME sends WhatsApp / form / SMS expressing interest

---

### **3. Data Collection & Prefill**  
*You gather SME info*  
- Business docs, ID, revenue proof, address  
- OCR or manual input into your dossier template  
- You minimize data entry by pre-filling what you can

---

### **4. Pre-Screening & Fraud Check (Internal)**  
*You filter out obviously fraudulent or non-qualified cases*  
- Basic checklist: SME age, director match, revenue above X  
- Manual red-flag spotting (e.g. shared address with vendor = scam risk)

---

### **5. Dossier Assembly**  
*You compile a full application package*  
- SME data + vendor quote + expected ESG impact  
- Optional: CO‚ÇÇ reduction estimate, invoice breakdown

---

### **6. Bank Matching & Submission**  
*You show this package to 1‚Äì3 partner banks*  
- Preferably anonymized at first (to prevent lead stealing)  
- Banks respond with interest + terms to underwrite

---

### **7. Formal Underwriting (Bank)**  
üß† **This is the step you flagged.**  
- Bank runs full credit analysis (based on SME financials, sector, loan amount)  
- May ask for more documents (you facilitate that)  
- Internal risk approval + ESG alignment review  
- Final outcome: **Approved Term Sheet**

---

### **8. Loan Acceptance & Contract Signing**  
- SME reviews terms, signs agreement (digitally or in person)  
- Compliance/KYC finalized

---

### **9. Escrow Setup + Conditional Disbursement**  
- Loan funds are transferred to escrow (or held internally)  
- Vendor gets paid **only after verification trigger**

---

### **10. Installation Verification**  
- SME confirms install via SMS  
- Optional: third-party auditor or field agent visits site  
- Install photos with GPS + timestamp

---

### **11. Funds Released to Vendor**

---

### **12. Monitoring & Reporting**
- Regular energy usage, financial check-ins, payment tracking  
- Alerts if loan performance deteriorates

---

## üß© In Summary: Where Underwriting Fits

| Phase | Responsible Party | Risk Gate | Decision |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Pre-screening** | You (Platform) | Fraud / noise filter | Forward to bank or reject |
| **Formal Underwriting** | Bank | Credit + ESG + compliance | Approve / decline / counteroffer |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Rule: **Never assume funding is "in motion" before underwriting is complete.**

- Your job is to deliver **high-quality dossiers** that require *minimal extra work* by the bank.
- The **bank owns the risk**, so they must underwrite‚Äîbut your platform **controls the deal flow**.

Would you like a **single-slide diagram** that shows this clarified flow‚Äîvisually and cleanly?

Or would you like me to draft a **Dossier Template** you‚Äôd hand over to banks after pre-screening?
