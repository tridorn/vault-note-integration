Below is a **strategic, low-pressure approach** to engaging ProCredit Bank (or any similar bank partner) in a way that lets you **listen to their needs** while also **advocating** for your solution. The goal is to come across as **solution-driven**, **collaborative**, and **genuinely helpful**, rather than showing up with a monologue that might not match their internal priorities.

---

## 1. Frame the Meeting as Exploratory & Collaborative
- **Communicate that you’re not just pitching** – you’re there to **understand** ProCredit’s context, challenges, and strategy on green lending.
- **Set the tone**: “We’d love to learn more about your green finance priorities, share our direction, and see if there’s a mutual fit.”

### Why It Works
- Banks get pitched at constantly, often in a one-sided way. By emphasizing *“We’re keen to hear your approach to green finance”*, you show respect for their viewpoint—and they’re more likely to open up.

---

## 2. Prepare a Short, Targeted Agenda
1. **Intro & Context** (2–3 minutes)  
   - A quick reintroduction of your team, the big picture impetus (“EU, EBA, the green wave for SMEs”).
2. **Listening Mode** (5–10 minutes)  
   - Ask them about **their** green lending strategy, challenges, or specific products.  
   - Let them talk about **pain points**, be it data overhead, compliance, or low SME uptake.
3. **Your Value Proposition** (5 minutes)  
   - A quick, crisp overview: “Here’s how we solve the friction specifically, referencing where they just said they have challenges.”  
   - Show relevant metrics or pilot references, if any.
4. **Open Discussion / Next Steps** (5–10 minutes)  
   - Explore possibilities for a pilot or scoping session.  
   - Summarize the meeting’s key points and confirm next steps.

**Total**: ~20–30 minutes. Respect their time.

### Why It Works
- A **structured, short** plan prevents rambling. They see you’re **organized** and mindful of their schedule.  
- You let them talk early, so your solution can be **tailored** in real-time to their stated needs.

---

## 3. Key Questions to Encourage Their Input
- **“How does ProCredit currently define or identify green loans, if at all?”**  
- **“Where do you see the biggest bottlenecks or overhead in green loan approvals for SMEs?”**  
- **“What kind of data or metrics are you missing to scale these programs?”**  
- **“Are there any public or internal targets you’re trying to hit for green financing?”**

### Why It Works
- These questions force them to **pinpoint** their struggles or objectives. Then you can shape your discussion to align with exactly those points.

---

## 4. Align with Their “Language”
- If they keep talking about “**green mortgages**,” pivot your SME pitch lightly to note your solution can **also** support that.  
- If they emphasize “**EU Taxonomy** alignment,” highlight you have **Taxonomy-based** data checks.  
- If they mention needing **“impact reporting”** for an upcoming pilot, talk about your potential **monitoring / reporting** features.

### Why It Works
- By adapting your solution story to the **banks’ vocabulary and priorities**, you prove you’re listening and flexible. They feel **understood**.

---

## 5. Focus on Concrete Next Steps
Rather than selling them everything at once, propose a **small-scale pilot** or a scoping workshop:

1. **Pilot**  
   - “We can do a 3-month pilot focusing on rooftop solar for SMEs in [Region X]. Our platform helps gather data and produce a standard application packet. You see how it cuts underwriting time.”  
2. **Scoping**  
   - “Alternatively, we can set up a short workshop with your green finance or product development team to walk them through how this fits your existing processes.”

### Why It Works
- Banks love **low-risk** steps. A pilot is minimal disruption yet yields real data.  
- They see you’re not pushing for a giant system overhaul from day one—less threatening, more likely to say “yes.”

---

## 6. Convey Confidence & Flexibility
- **Confidence**: You have a clear handle on the big opportunity (green SME loans are a policy + market push).  
- **Flexibility**: Emphasize you can adapt scope or features to **their** immediate priorities. “We understand every bank is at a different stage—let’s find the sweet spot for ProCredit.”

### Why It Works
- No bank wants a rigid partner. By showing you have the vision **and** can tune it for them, you earn trust.

---

## 7. Sense Their Direction & Commit to Follow-Ups
- If the bank’s **head of corporate strategy** sees synergy, they’ll mention it or direct you to the relevant product/ ESG/ credit risk teams.  
- Ask if they prefer a **formal pilot proposal** or an **internal workshop** next.  
- Offer to **draft a 1-page** or 2-page concept note to share with their colleagues.  

### Why It Works
- You’re letting them define the next step. This “guided choice” approach makes them commit—either they want more detail (proposal) or an internal presentation, etc.

---

## 8. Remain Calm, Inquire More Than You Pitch
- Avoid rattling off a big pitch if you sense they have **less time** or are **overloaded**.  
- Instead, get them engaged by letting them “drive” the conversation with their own concerns about green finance in the region.

### Why It Works
- People open up if they feel you’re genuinely curious about solving their problems rather than just selling. They might reveal **specific** operational or strategic drivers that are your hook.

## Final Thoughts
Your best approach for the upcoming meeting is:
1. **Keep it short** & structured so they feel in control.  
2. **Dig** into their real pain points quickly—makes your solution more relevant.  
3. **Propose** a small pilot or next-step conversation that’s easy to say “yes” to.  
4. **Listen** more than you talk—**30%** you, **70%** them.  

By being **collaborative** and **adaptable**, you’ll uncover exactly how to shape Veridian’s offering to **match** ProCredit’s direction, **securing** their buy-in for your next steps.
