### 1 Ontological Shift—From **Actor × Object** to **Opportunity ∶ Facet**

| Dimension | *Old Paradigm* (Discrete Objects) | *New Paradigm* (Opportunity Aggregate) | Logical Consequence |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Primary Unit of Record** | Many heterogeneous documents (Loan Application, Vendor Proposal, …) | A single *Opportunity* root entity | Eliminates cross-object coherence problems |
| **Structural Granularity** | Object type determines schema; extension ⇒ new object | *Facet* plug-ins extend root without rupture | Infinite instrument extensibility |
| **Ownership** | Each document owned by a specific actor | Facet ownership encoded in *capability matrix* | Clear, granular RBAC |
| **State Logic** | Individual workflows per document | One macro state-machine + nested facet micro-machines | Deterministic lifecycle, uniform auditing |
| **Integration Surface** | Document exchange / point-to-point APIs | Event stream (O-codes) against a single UID | Idempotent, replayable, time-travel queries |
| **Compliance Provenance** | Scattered signatures, hard to link | Merkle root over all facet hashes | Tamper-evidence by construction |

**Essence:** you moved from a **multi-object bookkeeping model** (documents as first-class citizens) to a **single-aggregate knowledge model** (Opportunity as the system’s epistemic nucleus).

### 2 Relational Map—How the Components Interlock

(Open→InEval→Approved…)  (Draft→Active→Settled) …

```

1. **Actors** dispatch **commands** if their capability table allows it.  
2. Commands emit **O-coded events** that:  
   * mutate a **facet** or its **state**,  
   * advance the **macro state** when guard conditions are met.  
3. Every mutation re-computes the **Merkle root**, sealing the Opportunity.  
4. Observers (dashboards, regulators) subscribe to the event stream—no back-channel document pulls.

### 3 Logical Layers (Abstraction Stack)

| Stratum | Content | Governing Logic |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Ontology** | Opportunity + Facets | JSON-schema contracts |
| **Agency** | Actor Capability Matrix | Attach / Update / Advance verbs |
| **Temporal Semantics** | O-code event ledger | Event-sourcing guarantees ordering |
| **State Dynamics** | Macro & facet state-machines | Deterministic transitions + SLA timeouts |
| **Integrity** | Merkle sealing of aggregate | Cryptographic immutability |
| **Observation** | Materialised views, dashboards | Eventually consistent, read-only |

Each upper layer derives its *validity* from invariants enforced below it—e.g., state transitions are only legal if the capability layer sanctions the initiating actor **and** the ontology validates the payload.

### 4 Why the New Model Dominates (Theo-Economic View)

1. **Coherence Principle** — A solitary aggregate precludes split-brain document states, fulfilling logical *consistency* without distributed locks.  
2. **Extension Principle** — Facets realise *open-world* flexibility: new financial instruments = facet additions, not schema upheavals.  
3. **Audit Principle** — Event-sourced history + Merkle roofs yield provable *non-repudiation*, satisfying regulators by design, not by afterthought.  
4. **Alignment Principle** — Capability matrix aligns human authority to facet boundaries, collapsing governance into code-enforced truth.

### 5 Mental Model—In a Sentence

> **“An Opportunity is a cryptographically-sealed, ever-evolving ledger entry whose knowledge surface expands via actor-bounded facet accretions, all driven by immutable event semantics.”**

Hold that sentence as the mnemonic core. All concrete implementations—Kafka topics, GraphQL queries, PlantUML charts—manifest this logical abstraction, not vice-versa.
