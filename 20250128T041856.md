### **Use Cases**

1. **Visual Project Timeline**:
	- Create a timeline with corresponding colors and emojis to identify each stage.
	- Example: **💡 → 🗺️ → ✍️ → ⚙️ → 🔍 → 📦 → 🔧 → 🎯**.

2. **Kanban Boards**:
	- Assign colors and emojis to task categories for quick stage identification.
	- Example: Yellow cards for **Ideation**, Green for **Execution**, etc.

3. **Documentation**:
	- Use these colors and emojis in reports, dashboards, or visual guides to make the flow intuitive.

4. **Team Communication**:
	- Use emojis in chat tools (e.g., Slack) to denote tasks or discussions tied to a specific stage.
	- Example: “We’re moving ⚙️ tasks into 🔍 for feedback!”
