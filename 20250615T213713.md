You should have asked: _"Visually and operationally, what would daily interaction with this system look like for a non-technical user and a technical lead? Simulate the UX across common workflows."_

Below is a **mental simulation** of how interfacing with this stack works in practice--**not from an infrastructure view**, but **from a user-experience standpoint**.
* * *

## I. Primary Interfaces (User-Facing)

| Interface | User Type | Technology | Function | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Mission Console** | Mission Commander, FO | Retool or custom web UI | View Mission Orders, update Sprint state, access artefacts | 
| **Slack Workspace** | Everyone | Slack (w/ bots) | Daily communication, `/upload`, `/report`, `/share`, etc. | 
| **Visual Repo View** | Technical staff, FO | GitHub Web UI | See files, diffs, edit MasterContent, comment | 
| **Upload Panel** | Support Staff, Designers | Web drop zone (S3) | Upload asset, auto-version, tag to Mission | 
| **Dashboard** | Program Dir, SO | Metabase / Lightdash | View KPIs, risk heatmap, burndown from MetricMap & RiskSheet | 
* * *

## II. **User Flow: Mission Execution Example**

### ðŸ§­ _Context_: Mission 25.M06 to redesign product landing page

* * *

### Step 1 Â· **Mission Kickoff**

- **FO** opens the _Mission Console_
- Selects Project: `25-P001_SaaS-Launch`
- Creates new Mission Pack: `25-P001_M06_Landing-Redesign`
- Auto-generates:

    - `MissionOrder.yaml` (template)

    - Branch `mission/M06` from project repo

    - Empty folders: `/SprintBoards/`, `/Output/`, `/ProcessCards/`

**UI**: Simple web form â†’ "Create Mission" â†’ Done in <1 min

* * *

### Step 2 Â· **Team Receives Brief**

- Designer opens Slack
- FO posts:

> "ðŸŽ¯ New Mission created: _Landing Redesign_  
â†’ [MasterContent.md](#)  
â†’ [Sprint Board](#)  
â†’ [Asset Upload](#)"

- Designer clicks "Asset Upload" â†’ drag-and-drops `hero-v1.sketch`
- File gets stored in S3 under `/assets/M06/hero-v1.sketch`
- Metadata auto-written to `MasterContent.md` via Git commit bot
* * *

### Step 3 Â· **Execution Phase**

- Dev pushes frontend code to Git branch `mission/M06`
- Sprint Board updated inside GitHub Issues
- FO runs `/report sprint` in Slack:  
â†’ Auto-fetches status from `SprintBoards/`  
â†’ Returns current blockers + days remaining
* * *

### Step 4 Â· **Sprint Close**

- Mission Cmdr clicks "Close Sprint" in _Mission Console_
- Prompted to update:

    - `MasterContent.md` summary

    - `MetricMap.json` for delta

    - `RiskSheet.csv` if any changes
- On submit:

    - CI bot lints the artefacts

    - Creates signed tag `M06-Sprint03`

    - Pushes diff to `main` on Project repo
* * *

### Step 5 Â· **Deliverable Ready**

- Designer posts `/share M06 hero-v2.sketch`
- Bot returns signed link to S3 file
- FO embeds link into `InterfaceContract.yaml` between Mission and Marketing SD
* * *

## III. Alternate Workflows (at a glance)

| Action | Trigger | Interface | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Request legal review | Click "New IC" â†’ select SD-Legal | Retool-form writes `InterfaceContract.yaml` | 
| Log major decision | FO runs `/decisionlog` | Slack bot appends to `DecisionLog.csv` | 
| Update KPI progress | Sprint close auto-prompt | Form updates `MetricMap.json` | 
| View historical Mission | GitHub UI â†’ browse `mission/M01` branch | Full context retained | 
| Visualise risk heatmap | Dashboard â†’ Risk view | From `RiskSheet.csv` of active Missions | 

* * *

## IV. What the User _Never Sees_

- Git CLI
- S3 dashboard
- SQL
- CI code
- JSON schemas  
All of these are abstracted behind web forms, bots, or dashboards.

* * *

## Summary

You are **not building a dev-first system**. You're creating a **structured execution layer** that:
- Has Git as the invisible ledger
- S3 as the invisible asset vault
- Retool + Slack as the operational UI
- Metabase as the visual cockpit

**It feels like using Notion + Slack + Figma--but everything is contract-bound, versioned, and auditable.** No sprawl, no guesswork.
