Heart Rate Zones

A good heart rate zone for running depends on your fitness goals, such as whether you're aiming to improve cardiovascular fitness, burn fat, or increase speed and endurance. Here's a basic guideline to understand the different heart rate zones and what you might aim for:

1. **Base Heart Rate Calculation**: First, calculate your maximum heart rate (MHR) to understand your zones. The commonly used formula is \( 220 - \text{age} \). For you, at 23 years old, your MHR would be approximately 197 beats per minute (bpm).
2. **Heart Rate Zones**:
	- **Zone 1 - Very Light (50-60% of MHR)**: This is good for warm-ups and cool-downs.
	- **Zone 2 - Light (60-70% of MHR)**: Enhances basic endurance and fat burning. This is about 118 to 138 bpm for you.
	- **Zone 3 - Moderate (70-80% of MHR)**: Improves aerobic fitness. You should aim for 138 to 158 bpm.
	- **Zone 4 - Hard (80-90% of MHR)**: Increases maximum performance capacity for shorter sessions. This means running at 158 to 177 bpm.
	- **Zone 5 - Maximum (90-100% of MHR)**: Develops speed and can be used for short bursts during interval training. This is from 177 to 197 bpm for you.

For general fitness improvements, many runners focus on Zone 2 for longer runs to build endurance and burn fat efficiently, while incorporating some intervals in Zone 4 to improve aerobic capacity and speed. If you are new to running, you might want to spend most of your time in Zone 2 to build a solid aerobic base before incorporating more intense workouts.

It's important to listen to your body and adjust these zones based on how you feel during your runs. Using a heart rate monitor can provide more precise guidance and help you stay in the desired zone.
