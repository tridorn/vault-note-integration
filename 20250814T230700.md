Alright -- here's your Clean Break Plan from Germany to Dubai, tailored for someone who already has a small GmbH and is at the early stage of building a bigger international structure.

  

The goal:

- Move without triggering a huge exit tax bill.
- Avoid being classified as German tax resident after leaving.
- Position Dubai as your real center of life and management.

## Step 1 -- 12--18 Months Before the Move

  

Objective: Lower exit tax exposure & prepare your corporate structure.

1. Get a Business Valuation Now

    - Have your GmbH officially valued while it's still early-stage and low-value.

    - If the Finanzamt taxes "unrealized gains" on exit, it's better they calculate from a small number.

2. Restructure Ownership (three main paths)

    - Option A -- Sell GmbH Shares to Foreign Holding (Pre-Move)

        - Create a UAE or EU (Netherlands/Luxembourg) holding company now.

        - Sell GmbH shares to it at current low valuation.

        - If done while you're still German resident, this might still trigger tax -- needs legal/tax advisory to do safely.

    - Option B -- Move GmbH Under Delaware C-Corp Parent

        - Form Delaware company now, sell GmbH shares to it at low value.

        - This works if you're planning U.S. fundraising later anyway.

    - Option C -- Reduce Below 1% Ownership

        - If you have partners, dilute your share below 1% -- avoids exit tax trigger entirely.

        - Downside: You lose majority control in Germany.

3. Start Moving IP & Contracts

    - File trademarks and software copyrights under Dubai entity before move.

    - Begin signing new contracts via Dubai entity to establish an operational track record.

## Step 2 -- 6--9 Months Before the Move

  

Objective: Create your Dubai life & business presence before cutting Germany ties.

1. Incorporate Dubai Free Zone Company

    - Choose zone based on your focus: DMCC (general/commodities), DIFC (finance), Dubai Internet City (tech).

    - Set broad activity scope to cover incubation, investment, and consulting.

2. Open UAE Bank Accounts & Deposit Operating Capital

    - Start routing some non-German revenues to Dubai.

3. Secure Dubai Residence & Emirates ID

    - Rent or buy a place in Dubai.

    - Move some personal assets (furniture, car, etc.) to make it clear your life is shifting.

4. Shift Management Location

    - Hold board meetings in Dubai.

    - Sign important contracts there.

    - Start keeping minutes and records in UAE.

## Step 3 -- 3 Months Before the Move

  

Objective: Break German tax residency without raising suspicion.

1. Deregister in Germany (Abmeldung)

    - Give up your German residence address officially.

    - Terminate or sell any rental/owned property you personally live in.

2. Cut "Center of Vital Interests"

    - If you have a partner or family, they must move too -- leaving them behind will likely keep you classified as resident.

    - Transfer main bank accounts to UAE.

3. Switch Client Invoicing

    - EU clients now contract either with Dubai OpCo or German GmbH as an agent of Dubai.

    - Limit German GmbH activity to what's essential for EU market credibility.

## Step 4 -- Move Date & First Year in Dubai

  

Objective: Cement non-residency and UAE management control.

1. Avoid Extended Germany Stays

    - Stay under 60--90 days total in Germany in Year 1.

    - No signing major contracts or holding management meetings there.

2. Dubai Becomes Operational HQ

    - All key decisions, signatures, hires, and investments happen from Dubai.

    - Keep documented proof (meeting minutes, travel logs, stamped contracts).

3. Tax Filing for Departure Year

    - File a split-year tax return in Germany -- part resident, part non-resident.

    - Have your departure supported by official UAE residency docs.

## Risk Management

- Exit Tax Audit Risk: If you restructure early, be ready to prove why you moved shares (commercial reason, not just tax).
- Management Location Risk: Always be able to prove that "mind and management" of Dubai OpCo is in Dubai.
- Future Re-Entry Risk: If you later return to Germany, exit tax rules could be triggered again if assets appreciated -- plan long-term.
* * *

### Key Takeaways

- The single biggest financial danger is exit tax on GmbH shares -- so your valuation timing is critical.
- The single biggest residency danger is leaving a home, family, or management control in Germany -- all three must move.
- The safest play is to restructure 1--2 years before the move while the company's value is still low, and build Dubai as a real, functioning base before officially cutting ties.
