Given the unique attributes of the Crystallines – their magical essence, crystalline forms, and intellectual prowess – their fighting style would be a blend of elegance, magic, and tactical superiority. Here’s an imaginative and epic approach to their combat style:

**1. Crystalline Form Manipulation**:
   - **Shape-Shifting**: Crystallines can alter their physical forms, extending limbs into weapons or creating defensive barriers. In battle, they shift fluidly, adapting their bodies to offensive and defensive needs.
   - **Armor Integration**: Their crystalline bodies can morph into armor-like structures, providing natural protection while maintaining mobility.

**2. Elemental Magic and Energy Manipulation**:
   - **Energy Blasts**: They harness the magical energy coursing through them to unleash powerful blasts or beams of energy against their foes.
   - **Elemental Control**: Crystallines can manipulate elemental forces – conjuring fire, water, wind, or earth as weapons. A Crystalline might summon a storm of razor-sharp ice shards or create a wall of stone for defense.

**3. Telekinetic and Psychic Abilities**:
   - **Telekinesis**: They can manipulate objects or enemies from a distance, using their minds to throw, crush, or construct barriers.
   - **Mind Attacks**: Utilizing psychic assaults, they can disorient, confuse, or even incapacitate foes without physical confrontation.

**4. Tactical and Strategic Mastery**:
   - **Battlefield Control**: With their advanced intellects, Crystallines excel in controlling the battlefield, predicting enemy moves, and creating strategies that turn the tide of battle.
   - **Coordinated Attacks**: When fighting in groups, they synchronize flawlessly, combining their abilities to create devastating combo attacks or impenetrable defenses.

**5. Mystical Arts and Illusion**:
   - **Illusion Casting**: They can cast illusions to confuse enemies, create decoys, or mask their movements.
   - **Mystic Traps**: Setting up magical traps that can immobilize, weaken, or harm an adversary.

**6. Harmonized Combat**:
   - **Mind Link**: Crystallines in a combat unit might link their minds to enhance coordination, reacting to threats with uncanny synchronicity.
   - **Energy Sharing**: In dire situations, they can share their magical energy among each other, boosting their powers temporarily for a massive collective attack.

**7. Mobility and Speed**:
   - **Levitation and Flight**: Some Crystallines might use magic to levitate or fly, offering superior mobility and the ability to strike from unexpected angles.
   - **Blink Movements**: Short-range teleportation or rapid movements make them elusive and unpredictable in combat.

**8. Magical Weapons and Artifacts**:
   - **Enchanted Weapons**: They wield weapons infused with their own crystalline essence, which could have unique properties like energy amplification or elemental infusion.
   - **Artifacts of Power**: Utilize ancient magical artifacts that enhance their abilities or provide specific powers needed for certain battles.

In practice, a Crystalline's combat style is a mesmerizing dance of shifting forms, elemental fury, and tactical brilliance. They engage in battle with a fluid grace, combining physical prowess with magical abilities, making them formidable and awe-inspiring warriors on the battlefield.
