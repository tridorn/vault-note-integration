### 1 Actor Capability Matrix  
*(Foundational ontology—freeze before elaborating any flow logic)*

| Actor | **Can Do** (authorised discretionary actions) | **Must Do** (hard obligations) | **Cannot Do** (explicit interdictions) | **Primary Trigger-Events**¹ |
|-------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **SME** (Borrower) | • Initiate loan intent • Select vetted vendor • Upload financial & impact data • Accept loan terms | • Provide KYC/AML credentials • Maintain periodic impact reports • Sign data-sharing mandate | • Alter verification artefacts • Bypass platform in vendor contracting | E1, E3, E6, E8 |
| **Vendor** | • Issue project proposal • Update implementation milestones • Request verification visit | • Deliver specification & invoice evidence • Cooperate with verifier audits | • Self-verify impact claims • Amend SME financials | E2, E4, E5 |
| **Platform** (Your Startup) | • Orchestrate data exchange • Validate schema compliance • Compute eligibility heuristics • Notify actors | • Maintain tamper-proof audit log • Enforce role-based access control • Escalate SLA breaches | • Manipulate artefact content • Render credit decisions | E0-E9 (all) |
| **External Verifier** | • Schedule on-site/remote audit • Generate assurance report • Flag anomalies | • Follow ISO/IES procedures • Submit signed verification package within SLA | • Edit vendor invoices • Grant or deny credit | E4, E5, E7 |
| **Bank** | • Retrieve submission dossier • Run credit & green-taxonomy scoring • Issue conditional offers | • Render final credit decision • Disburse funds on satisfied conditions • Report loan to regulator if subsidised | • Modify verification data • Engage vendor directly | E6, E7 |
| **Regulator / Incentive Body** | • Publish eligibility frameworks • Grant subsidy / guarantee certificates • Conduct supervisory audits | • Update taxonomy thresholds • Receive periodic compliance feeds | • Influence individual credit decisions • Possess actor PII beyond mandate | E9 |

### 2 Actor Trigger Ledger  
*(Event-driven choreography—defines **when** each actor is compelled to act and with what payload)*

| **Event Code** | Event Description | Initiator | Obligated Respondent(s) | Preconditions | Data / Artefact Payload | Response SLA | Consequence of Breach |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|-------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| **E0** | Actor onboarding request submitted | Any new actor | Platform | Valid identity token | KYC packet, capability claims | 24 h | Rejection of onboarding |
| **E1** | Loan intent declaration | SME | Vendor (informational), Platform | Valid onboarding, vendor shortlist | Intent form, SME baseline metrics | N/A (asynchronous) | — |
| **E2** | Vendor proposal issued | Vendor | SME, Platform | Receipt of E1 | Proposal doc, cost & impact estimate | 48 h SME review | Proposal lapse |
| **E3** | Dossier assembly complete | Platform (auto when all artefacts uploaded) | External Verifier | All mandatory artefacts present & signed | Immutable dossier bundle hash | 4 d audit start | Verification SLA breach notice |
| **E4** | Verification commencement | External Verifier | Vendor, SME | Booking confirmation | Audit schedule ID | 3 d to confirm | Audit reschedule escalation |
| **E5** | Assurance report delivered | External Verifier | Platform, Bank | Completion of field audit | Signed PDF + raw sensor data hash | 24 h ingest | Dossier stale flag |
| **E6** | Credit decision requested | Platform | Bank | Successful E5 ingestion | Clean dossier pointer | 5 bd decision window | Auto-decline & feedback loop |
| **E7** | Conditional approval granted | Bank | SME, Platform, Regulator | Passing credit & green score thresholds | Term sheet, compliance covenant list | 10 d SME acceptance | Offer expiry |
| **E8** | Periodic impact report due | Platform (cron) | SME, External Verifier | Disbursement milestone reached | Reporting template pre-filled | 7 d submission | Incentive claw-back trigger |
| **E9** | Regulatory schema update published | Regulator | Platform | Official bulletin release | New taxonomy schema, effective date | 48 h schema deployment | Suspension of new originations |

#### Usage Guidance  

* **Determinism:** Every trigger specifies *one and only one* obligated responder set and an SLA; this prevents race conditions.  
* **Auditability:** Event codes become Kafka topic keys or equivalent, guaranteeing immutable ordering.  
* **Extensibility:** Add new events by appending rows—no column proliferation required.  
* **Governance Sync:** The forthcoming Governance & Transition Table (#7) will reference identical event codes to wire state-machine transitions to real-world stimuli.

Lock these two artefacts in version control today; every downstream diagram or table must cite their IDs verbatim to preserve referential integrity.
