Doctrine essentially is the breathing body of the company.
Doctrine on its own could form an entire company.
It's able to stand on its own.

The different layers are all addressed by different parties. 
for ACM:
- Board essentially is charter (and LC)
- policy is LC
- directives is making policy more concrete and making strategy more concrete. Owned by LC and AGS
- Execution is owned by the executional arm
- evolution by AGS, ICC

My insight here was (beyond what's already known), that directives are a dynamic tool that deploys strategy instead of being a static item that makes policy more concrete
