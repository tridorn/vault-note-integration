### How to build ――fast but credibly――the **dealmaker’s brain-stack** Eupator needs  
Below is a rational, sequenced path that takes you from “smart entrepreneur” to “competent Mittelstand‐buyer & capital allocator” in ≈ 24 months without disappearing into an MBA black-hole.

| Phase | Horizon | Learning goals | Concrete moves | Proof-points |
|-------|---------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **1<br>Finance Grammar** | 0-4 m | • Fluent in statements (IS/BS/CF)  <br>• Debt vs. equity math  <br>• Working-capital & cash-conversion cycles | 1. **Coursera/Wharton “Introduction to Corporate Finance”** (4 weeks) <br>2. **“Corporate Finance Institute” FP&A bundle** (Excel modeling) <br>3. Re-model last year’s public Mittelstand accounts in Excel | • Build 3-statement model of a target SME <br>• Explain ROIC vs. ROE in plain German |
| **2<br>Small-cap M&A Mechanics** | 3-8 m (overlap) | • Search-fund & LBO terms  <br>• Deal timeline, SPA anatomy  <br>• Senior & subordinated debt structures | 1. Read **HBR Guide “Buying a Small Business”**  <br>2. Download & dissect **IESE “International Search Funds 2024” study**  ([[PDF] International Search Funds–2024 - IESE Business School](https://www.iese.edu/media/research/pdfs/ST-0658-E?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  <br>3. Attend one **ETA / search-fund workshop** (IESE, RSM, Vlerick)  ([International Search Fund Center | IESE Business School](https://www.iese.edu/entrepreneurship/search-funds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition (ETA) trajectory in your ...](https://www.rsm.nl/education/mba/campaigns/entrepreneurship-through-acquisition-eta-trajectory-in-your-executive-mba/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Entrepreneurial Buyout Academy | Vlerick Business School](https://www.vlerick.com/en/programmes/programmes-in-entrepreneurship/entrepreneurial-buyout-academy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | • Draft a mock Term-Sheet & Sources-&-Uses table for a €5 m EBITDA buy-out |
| **3<br>German succession market intelligence** | 4-9 m | • Sector-level multiples  <br>• Seller psychology & succession pain points  <br>• Local advisors & Sparkassen network | 1. Read succession-crisis reports (e.g., Zumera blog)  ([The Ticking Time Bomb: Germany's Mittelstand Succession Crisis](https://www.zumera.com/en/blog/the-ticking-time-bomb-germanys-mittelstand-succession-crisis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  <br>2. Cold-call 20 succession brokers / IHK advisors; log asking multiples & owner motives  <br>3. Join **Bundesverband M&A Mittelstand** events | • Build a proprietary “Deal Heat-Map” of 50 regional SMEs with owner age ≥ 58 |
| **4<br>Deal rehearsal & apprenticeship** | 8-14 m | • Run an actual due-diligence process  <br>• Negotiate bank term-sheet  <br>• Integration blueprint | 1. Serve as “observer/intern” on one live deal inside a boutique M&A firm (3-month mandate)  <br>2. Hire freelance DD team (legal + financial) and run a mock VDR review  <br>3. Use Corpus **Diagnostic Grid** on target; draft post-acquisition Governance/Form plan | • Present full IC memo to 3 friendly investors; get at least one soft commitment |
| **5<br>Capital-raising craft** | 10-18 m | • LP expectations & waterfall math  <br>• Bank covenant negotiation  <br>• Closing checklist mastery | 1. Reverse-engineer two publicly available PPMs  <br>2. Host a mini “LP day” (law-firm board-room, 5 family offices) and pitch *Eupator Evergreen I* concept  <br>3. Close a €1-2 m club deal mezzanine note for first micro-acquisition | • Signed term-sheet or LOI for first deal <br>• Verbal LP pledges ≥ €5 m |

### Tool-stack you build while learning  

| Month | Deliverable | Corpus link |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 2 | **Three-statement Excel template** (plug-n-play for diagnostics) | Financial cluster · Initiative-Control |
| 6 | **Deal Heat-Map Notion DB** (sourcing funnel with succession flags) | Strategy cluster · Initiative-Source |
| 9 | **Corpus DD checklist** (Governance & Form red-flag list) | Governance layers |
| 12 | **Integration Playbook v0.1** (90-day post-close SOP set) | Operational layer |
| 15 | **Investor Deck** (Corpus edge slides + pipeline) | Purpose & Financial clusters |

These artefacts turn your learning into permanent leverage for every future transaction.

### “Become-a-dealmaker” curriculum (short list)

| Topic | Best single book / resource |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| SME valuation | “Investment Banking, Valuation & LBOs” – Rosenbaum & Pearl (skim mid-market chapters) |
| German M&A law basics | “Mergers & Acquisitions in Germany” – Beck/Habersack (reference manual) |
| Search-fund playbook | Stanford “Search Fund Primer” + IESE 2024 report |
| Integration | “The Synergy Solution” – Howson & Dyer (adapt to Corpus-Lite) |
| Debt structuring | “Private Debt” – U. Hege & Barreto (chapters on unitranche and senior facilities) |
| Negotiation | “Never Split the Difference” – Voss (applied to owner-founder dialogues) |

---

### Mentorship / network hacks

1. **Shadow an ETA operator**—offer free Corpus Diagnostic to a search-fund CEO in exchange for shadow rights.  
2. **Join an LP syndicate** with tiny cheques (€10-25 k) to see deal flow & IC memos.  
3. **Monthly mentor board**: ex-Mittelstand owner, M&A lawyer, debt banker, ETA fund partner——one call each per month.  

> *You’re purchasing tacit skills with time & small capital instead of an MBA price-tag.*

### Key mindset shifts

| Old founder instinct | Corpus–dealmaker upgrade |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| “Great product → funding follows” | “Stable cash → capital flywheel funds R&D” |
| “Due-diligence = legal pile” | “DD = structural X-ray via Governance, Form, Initiative” |
| “Valuation negotiates price” | “Structure negotiates risk & exit avenues” |
| “Hire bankers to run the process” | “I *own* the process; advisors fill gaps only” |

### Final sanity check

You **do not** need to become a Wall-Street-level modeler.  
You need to be **dangerously competent** at:

1. Reading a P&L like a language.  
2. Understanding how bank covenants bite.  
3. Spotting structural red flags via Corpus lenses.  
4. Selling owners & LPs on *permanent home + operating upgrade*.

Everything above ladders exactly to those four outcomes. Stick to the sequence, ship the artefacts, close the first €3-5 m deal by month 18, and Eupator’s capital flywheel is alive.
