Your query could have been clearer: *How should I set up the IT infrastructure and what tools should I use for my new company?*

When building a company from the ground up, your IT infrastructure needs to be **scalable**, **secure**, and **streamlined** to support growth while minimizing complexity early on. Choosing the right tools from the start will help you set up a strong foundation for communication, development, project management, and security. Here's a structured approach to setting up your company’s IT infrastructure:

---

### **1. Core IT Infrastructure for Collaboration and Productivity**

#### **1.1 Cloud-Based Productivity Tools**

To ensure smooth communication and collaboration, adopt **cloud-based tools** that allow team members to work together seamlessly, regardless of location. The following tools are ideal for a startup environment:

- **Google Workspace** (formerly G Suite):
  - **Email**: Custom company email with your domain (e.g., `you@yourcompany.com`).
  - **Drive**: Cloud storage for documents, presentations, and files.
  - **Docs, Sheets, Slides**: Cloud-based documents and spreadsheets for collaboration in real-time.
  - **Calendar**: Team scheduling and meetings.

  This is an **all-in-one suite** for productivity, collaboration, and company communication. Google Workspace is ideal for companies of all sizes, and it scales well as your team grows.

- **Notion** (or **Microsoft OneNote**):
  - **Knowledge Base**: Use Notion as a **centralized knowledge repository** for storing company policies, guides, and documentation.
  - **Project Management**: You can also manage projects, tasks, and individual contributor progress within Notion through its flexible database and kanban board features.

#### **1.2 Communication Tools**

- **Slack**:
  - A communication tool for **real-time chat**, organized into **channels** (e.g., by department or project). It integrates with a variety of other tools and is essential for internal communication in growing teams.
  - **Integrations**: Slack integrates well with tools like **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, and **Notion** for seamless workflow and notifications.
  
- **Zoom** (or **Google Meet**):
  - For **video conferencing**, **virtual meetings**, and **webinars**. These tools are particularly useful for team communication and client meetings.

---

### **2. Development and Technical Infrastructure**

#### **2.1 Code Repositories and Version Control**

You need a central place to store, manage, and collaborate on code, especially if you’re building a technical product or platform.

- **GitHub Organization**:
  - As discussed earlier, set up a **GitHub organization** for the company to manage your codebase. This will allow team members to collaborate on code and projects while keeping everything centralized.

  - **Version Control**: Use **Git** to manage code versions, track changes, and work on features via branches. This helps manage parallel development efforts and integrates with your CI/CD pipelines.

#### **2.2 Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**

Automating builds, tests, and deployments is essential for efficient development cycles, ensuring that code is stable and deployable without manual intervention.

- **GitHub Actions**:
  - Use GitHub Actions for **continuous integration** to run tests automatically when new code is committed. You can also automate **deployments** to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
  
- **Vercel or Netlify**:
  - If your product is a website, these platforms integrate with GitHub for **automatic deployments**. Every push to `main` or `develop` triggers a **build and deployment** to production.
  - They also provide **preview deployments** for every pull request, so you can see the impact of new changes before they go live.

---

### **3. Project Management and Task Tracking**

As your team grows, managing tasks, priorities, and project timelines is critical to ensure alignment.

- **Trello** or **Asana**:
  - Both are **project management tools** that allow you to organize projects into **kanban boards**, create tasks, assign them to team members, and track progress. Trello is more lightweight, while Asana offers additional features for timelines and task dependencies.
  
- **Jira** (for more complex projects):
  - If your company focuses heavily on software development, **Jira** provides a more advanced **agile project management** system. It integrates well with GitHub and allows for detailed sprint planning, task prioritization, and bug tracking.

- **Notion** (Again):
  - For startups, Notion can double as a **project management tool** and **knowledge base**, giving you a unified platform for both documentation and task management.

---

### **4. Security and Access Management**

#### **4.1 Password Management**

- **1Password** or **LastPass**:
  - Use a **password manager** to securely store and share passwords for company accounts, tools, and software. This ensures secure access while keeping team members’ credentials protected.

#### **4.2 Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

- **Google Workspace Admin**:
  - Set up user permissions and **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all accounts to ensure that access to critical data is restricted and secure.
  
- **Okta** or **Auth0**:
  - For managing access to internal systems and applications, **Okta** and **Auth0** provide **single sign-on (SSO)**, **role-based access**, and **multi-factor authentication** for a unified approach to managing access across your company’s tools.

#### **4.3 Backup and Recovery**

- **Backups** for Google Workspace or other cloud systems to ensure that critical data (documents, emails) is regularly backed up and recoverable in case of data loss.

---

### **5. Cloud Hosting and Scalability**

As your company grows and your product or website gains traction, you’ll need to consider more scalable hosting solutions, especially if you’re building an app, SaaS product, or platform.

- **AWS** (Amazon Web Services):
  - AWS provides flexible cloud infrastructure for everything from hosting to databases and application services. You can start small with services like **EC2** (virtual machines), **S3** (storage), or **RDS** (managed databases) and scale up as traffic grows.

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** or **Microsoft Azure**:
  - Both GCP and Azure provide similar services to AWS, offering a range of cloud computing tools that can help you build and scale infrastructure as your company expands.

- **Serverless Functions** (via **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **AWS Lambda**):
  - As a startup, you can save on infrastructure costs and development time by leveraging **serverless architecture**. Serverless functions allow you to deploy small applications or APIs without managing the underlying server infrastructure.

---

### **6. Data and Analytics**

Understanding how users interact with your product or website is key for growth and optimization.

- **Google Analytics**:
  - Track user behavior, traffic sources, and conversion rates on your website or application. Google Analytics gives you insights into how users are interacting with your digital products.
  
- **Google Search Console**:
  - For monitoring how your website performs in search engines, setting up **Google Search Console** allows you to track indexing status, search performance, and potential SEO issues.

- **Mixpanel** or **Segment**:
  - If your product is data-driven, use **Mixpanel** or **Segment** to track user events, analyze product usage, and gather insights into user behavior to make data-driven decisions.

---

### **7. Legal and Compliance Tools**

As a budding company, it’s important to stay on top of legal and compliance issues, especially if you’re collecting data from users or customers.

- **Termly** or **Iubenda**:
  - Use these services to **generate privacy policies**, **terms of service**, and **cookie consent banners** for your website, ensuring compliance with regulations like **GDPR** and **CCPA**.
  
- **DocuSign**:
  - If you need to manage contracts and agreements (e.g., employee agreements, client contracts), **DocuSign** allows for **digital signatures** and the secure exchange of documents.

---

### **8. Customer Support and Interaction**

As you grow, setting up systems for customer support will ensure that you can manage incoming requests and feedback effectively.

- **Zendesk** or **Freshdesk**:
  - These are customer support platforms that allow you to set up **help desks**, track support tickets, and manage customer interactions.
  
- **Intercom**:
  - For **real-time chat** and customer support on your website, **Intercom** is a great option for engaging users and providing live assistance. It integrates with other tools for ticketing and customer management.
