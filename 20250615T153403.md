A tighter phrasing would have been: _"Detail Section IV--the essential Flows & Interfaces--for the organisational doctrine you've outlined."_

* * *

## IV. Flows & Interfaces

### 1. Planning Flow (Strategy ➜ Execution)

| Step | Trigger | Producer • Artefact | Routing | Receiver • Obligation | SLA | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 1 | Annual reset | **SCX** → _Vision Dossier vN_ | Direct | **SO** | 5 bd acceptance | 
| 2 | Campaign launch | **SO** → _Campaign Charter_ | Direct | **CMP Sponsor** | 3 bd sign-off | 
| 3 | Program init | **CMP Sponsor** → _Program Directive_ | Program Board | **PGM Dir** | 2 bd | 
| 4 | Project kick‐off | **PGM Dir** → _Project Scope Doc_ | PMO | **PRJ Owner** | 2 bd | 
| 5 | Mission order | **PRJ Owner** → _Mission Order_ | FO channel | **MS Cmdr** | 1 bd | 
| 6 | Sprint backlog | **MS Cmdr** → Sprint Board | Shared repo | **Cell / Squad** | 0 bd | 

_bd = business day_  
Interface motto: **push downward, pull upward**--lower layers never wait for upstream artefacts; they receive.

* * *

### 2. Feedback Flow (Execution ➜ Governance)

| Signal | Origination Unit | Carrier | Landing Point | Aggregation Frequency | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Pulse Blocker Log | CE / SQ | FO relay | MS Cmdr | Daily | 
| Sprint Report | MS | FO | PRJ Owner | Sprint end | 
| Mission Scorecard | MS Cmdr | FO → Program Board | PGM Dir | Mid-Mission & closure | 
| Program Dashboard | PGM Dir | PMO | CMP Sponsor | Monthly | 
| Campaign Scorecard | CMP Sponsor | SO | SCX | Quarterly | 

FO acts as checksum: verifies data integrity before transmission.

* * *

### 3. Intelligence Processing Chain (Observation ➜ Decision)

1. **Collection**

    - Internal metrics autopushed to IH data lake.

    - External signals scraped via OSINT feed + vendor APIs.

2. **Triage**

    - _Priority-α_ (existential): IH phones SO Chief immediately.

    - _Priority-β_ (material): Bundled in Weekly Intel Brief.

    - _Priority-γ_ (contextual): Added to searchable archive.

3. **Synthesis**

    - IH drafts **Decision Intels** (one-page, "so-what" focus).

4. **Dissemination**

    - Priority-α → SCX + CMP Sponsor (≤ 2 h).

    - Priority-β → Program Board (weekly).

    - Priority-γ → self-serve portal (real-time).

Latency thresholds are contractual; IH audited quarterly.

* * *

### 4. Logistics & Resourcing Flow

| Phase | Initiator | Request Channel | Gatekeeper | Fulfilment Unit | Target Turnaround | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Forecast | MS Cmdr | _L-1 Form_ | SO Logistics | SD Lead | 10 bd pre-need | 
| On-Demand | CE / SQ | FO ticket | SD Ops Desk | SD Tech Cell | 2 bd | 
| Emergency | FO | Hotline | SD Duty Officer | SD Rapid Cell | 4 h | 

Cost allocation tags auto-attached; SO Finance reconciles monthly.

* * *

### 5. Coordination Mechanics (Cross-Mission & Cross-Program)

| Mechanism | Cadence | Participants | Purpose | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Mission Sync Grid | Weekly | FO cohort + MS Cmdrs | Surface inter-Mission clashes | 
| Program Board | Monthly | PGM Dir, CMP Sponsor, SD Leads | Resolve resource conflicts, approve trade-offs | 
| Campaign Conclave | Quarterly | SO Chief, CMP Sponsors, SCX observers | Pivot or persist decision gate | 
| Portfolio Council | Annual | SCX + SO Chiefs | Reallocate capital, retire or spin-up Campaigns | 

Meetings are time-boxed; unresolved items escalate automatically to next tier.

* * *

### 6. Interface Discipline

- **Single-Owner Rule**: every artefact lists exactly one Accountable role.
- **Checksum Fields**: version, downstream recipient list, "last updated" timestamp.
- **Audit Logs**: immutable; edits produce new minor version, never overwrite.

Break any of the above and FO files a _Non-Compliance Notice_ to SO Audit.

* * *

These flows guarantee deterministic movement of information, resources, and authority across the lattice--no silent gaps, no orphan signals.
