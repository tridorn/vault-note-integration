# Data Points

## Exposition

Absolutely, let's focus on making the data collection process simple, efficient, and mainly revolving around categorical and numerical data, reducing the free text fields to essential ones only. Here's an updated version:

1. **Session Data:**

	1.1. **Session Objective Category:** A dropdown menu with various categories like 'Administrative', 'Cognitive', 'Creative', etc.

	2.2. **Objective Completion:** A simple yes/no field to indicate whether the session's primary objective was completed.

	3.3. **Number of Tasks Completed:** A numeric field for entering the number of tasks you completed during this session.

	4.4. **Time Spent on Tasks:** Multiple-choice options such as 'Less than expected', 'As expected', 'More than expected'.

2. **Performance Data:**

	1.1. **Productivity Score:** Rate your productivity during the session on a scale (1-5).

	2.2. **Energy Level:** Rate your energy level during the session on a scale (1-5).

	3.3. **Distractions:** Multiple-choice options like 'None', 'Minimal', 'Moderate', 'Significant', with an additional free text field for specifying the nature of the distraction, if any.

	4.4. **Emotional State:** Rate your emotional state during the session on a scale (1-5).

3. **Learning and Improvement Data:**

	1.1. **Challenges Encountered:** Multiple-choice options like 'None', 'Minimal', 'Moderate', 'Significant', with an additional free text field for specifying the nature of the challenge, if any.

	2.2. **Improvement Measures Taken:** This could be a dropdown menu with common improvements like "Allocated more time", "Break task into smaller parts", "Sought help", etc., plus an "Other" option for typing in specifics.

	3.3. **Key Learnings:** Concise free text field for noting any significant learning points from the session.

This structure minimizes the need for extensive writing, making the process quicker and easier to manage, while still capturing essential data.
