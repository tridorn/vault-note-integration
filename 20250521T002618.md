<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- Do initial setup-batch for Eupator
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
-  Handle administrative tasks

### Process

- Task 1: Focus on a value sprint early
- Task 2: Do in the latter of the day
- Task 3: In the middle of the day to keep business hours

### Friction Mitigation
<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->
- Getting sidetracked
- No attention to timeframes
