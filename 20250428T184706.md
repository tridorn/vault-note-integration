### **Landscape-Mapping Framework — categories you must interrogate**

| Ordinal | Category | What to catalogue | Why it matters |
|---------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **1** | **Demand Archetypes (SMEs)** | • Sector & NACE code<br>• Energy-intensity (kWh / € revenue)<br>• Cap-ex envelope & payback horizon<br>• Digital maturity (API-ready vs. manual)<br>• Existing subsidy uptake | Determines loan sizing, guarantee eligibility, integration cost, and therefore initial wedge. |
| **2** | **Vendor Constellations** | • Retrofit installers (PV, HP, insulation)<br>• Equipment OEMs with performance guarantees<br>• IoT / smart-meter providers<br>• EPC contractors | You need critical mass of high-trust vendors to feed loan flow and to close the MRV loop. |
| **3** | **Capital Suppliers** | • Tier-1 & Tier-2 banks<br>• German Landesbanken & local Sparkassen<br>• Digital banks & specialty green funds<br>• EU supranationals (EIB, EIF) | Each tier has distinct ESG-risk appetites, pricing grids, and data-file requirements. |
| **4** | **Public Guarantee & Subsidy Schemes** | • KfW 270/288 Umweltprogramm<br>• EIB InnovFin / PF4EE<br>• EIF Sustainability Guarantee<br>• InvestEU climate windows | Stacking guarantees is the cheapest risk-capital hack.

Map article-by-article to product features. |
| **6** | **Competitor Cohorts** | *a. ESG data/reporting SaaS* – Greenomy, Sweep, Watershed, Greenly, Coolset  ([The top 5 CSRD software platforms in 2025 - SWEEP](https://www.sweep.net/insights/the-top-5-csrd-software-platforms-in-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com))<br>*b. Integrated installer-finance platforms* – Cloover (PV + HP bundles)  ([Climate tech Cloover raises $114 mln in seed funding](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-tech-cloover-raises-114-mln-seed-funding-2024-05-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))<br>*c. Horizontal loan marketplaces* – Planera, Creditshelf, Funding Circle (non-green-specific)<br>*d. Green crowdfunding & mini-bond portals* – 27 + German platforms  ([List of Green energy crowdfunding platforms in Germany](https://thecrowdspace.com/directory/green-energy-crowdfunding-platforms-in-germany/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Clarifies where you must out-flank (data provenance) versus where you can partner (lead origination). |
| **7** | **Data-Infrastructure Providers** | • Open-banking aggregators (Tink, Yapily)<br>• ERP connectors (Datev, SAP Business One)<br>• Smart-meter networks (Discovergy, Theben)<br>• Digital ID / KYC vendors (IDnow, Verimi) | Dependences that may become cost or latency bottlenecks; negotiate volume SLAs early. |
| **8** | **Substitute Financing Modes** | • Leasing & ESCO “efficiency-as-a-service” models  ([How SMEs can benefit from efficiency as a service to boost profits ...](https://www.eib.org/en/stories/servitisation-energy-efficiency-sme?utm_source=chatgpt.com))<br>• Direct utility on-bill financing<br>• Corporate PPA structures<br>• Traditional bank cap-ex loans (brown) | Benchmarks for your APR and underwriting-time promises. |
| **9** | **Complementary Channels & Gatekeepers** | • Chambers of commerce, craft guilds (HWK) <br>• Energy consultants & auditors (DIN EN 16247-1 certified)<br>• Trade associations (ZVEH, VDMA)<br>• Regional economic-development agencies | They control SME mind-share; co-sell or embed your wizard in their portals. |
| **10** | **Risk-Transfer Partners** | • Reinsurers seeking climate-risk data curves (Swiss Re, Munich Re)<br>• Credit-insurance carriers (Atradius, EulerHermes)<br>• Hedge-fund buyers of green asset-backed securities | Monetises the longitudinal MRV dataset and deepens moat. |

#### **How to use this taxonomy**

1. **Populate each cell** with named entities, current pricing norms, and API readiness.  
2. **Score strategic variables** (market size, ease of capture, switching costs) to expose leverage points.  
3. **Overlay interdependencies**—e.g., guarantee schemes link directly to capital-supplier tiers; vendor reliability affects MRV credibility. Mapping the graph, not just the nodes, reveals defensible choke-points.  
4. **Update quarterly**; regulation and subsidy menus are moving targets. Treat the map as a living annex to your product roadmap.

**Outcome:** A feature-complete vista of the terrain, rendering blind spots explicit and guiding both product sequencing and political lobbying efforts.
