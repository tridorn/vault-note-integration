The distinction between **skimming** and **fully reading** depends on the stage and the goals of your note-taking process. Let's clarify **when** and **how** each activity—skimming, reading, and note-taking—occurs across the stages.

---

### **1. Input Phase: Skimming, Scanning, and Mapping**

- **Activity in Input Phase:**  
- **Skimming** and **scanning** the chapter or source to create an **overview.**
- Identify **themes**, **key headings**, and **important sections** worth deeper engagement.
- **Purpose:**  
- To decide **what's relevant** to your goals and focus areas.
- To establish a mental framework of the material before committing to a detailed reading.

**What to Do:**
- **Skim:**  
- Read headings, subheadings, bolded text, summaries, or abstract sections.  
- Look for diagrams, tables, or key terms that stand out.  
- **Annotate lightly:**  
- Mark sections that appear most relevant to your **Purpose, Goals, and Key Questions.**
- **Decide scope:**  
- Select which parts need full reading and detailed note-taking.

**What You’re Not Doing Yet:**
- Taking detailed notes or fully engaging with the material.
- Spending time on less relevant sections.

**Key Output:**
- A prioritized **map** of what to read deeply.
- Initial **questions** or observations.

---

### **2. Processing Phase: Full Reading and Structured Note-Taking**

- **Activity in Processing Phase:**  
- This is the stage for **fully reading** the material and taking **structured notes.**
- As you read, engage critically and organize your thoughts into the Cornell format (or similar system).

- **Purpose:**  
- To deeply engage with the material, extracting key insights and structuring them into actionable notes.
- To ensure you address your **Goals** and **Key Questions** while refining them as needed.

**What to Do:**
- **Read deeply:**  
- Focus on the sections identified during the Input Phase.  
- If the entire chapter is relevant, go through it systematically.  
- **Take structured notes:**  
- Use the Cornell Method (or an equivalent structure).  
- Record **main points, reflections, and connections** in the Main Notes Column.  
- Write **keywords** or **guiding prompts** in the Cue Column.  
- **Refine Objectives:**  
- Adjust your **Goals** or **Key Questions** based on new insights or unexpected discoveries.

**What You’re Not Doing Yet:**
- Breaking the notes into atomic concepts (that happens in the next stage).
- Focusing on peripheral details or tangents unless they connect to your objectives.

**Key Output:**
- A comprehensive, **structured set of notes** summarizing the material.
- A refined understanding of the **Purpose, Goals, and Key Questions.**

---

### **3. Synthesis Phase: Refining into Conceptual Notes**

- **Activity in Synthesis Phase:**  
- Here, you **transform structured notes** into **atomic notes** using the Input → Process → Output framework.
- Engage in critical analysis, synthesis, and interlinking.

- **Purpose:**  
- To break down broad ideas into **self-contained, reusable concepts.**
- To draw actionable insights, resolve unanswered questions, and build connections to other knowledge.

**What to Do:**
- **Review structured notes:**  
- Identify distinct ideas or themes that can stand alone.
- **Create atomic notes:**  
- For each concept, write a note using Input → Process → Output.
- Answer **Key Questions** and address your **Goals** in the Output section.
- **Link notes:**  
- Connect related notes to create a network of ideas.
- **Reflect and refine:**  
- Evaluate what new questions remain or whether follow-up research is required.

**What You’re Not Doing:**
- Revisiting the source directly (unless something needs clarification).
- Copy-pasting your structured notes verbatim—this is about refinement and deeper thinking.

**Key Output:**
- A collection of **atomic notes**, each addressing one concept or idea.
- A clearer understanding of how the material fits into your broader knowledge system.

### **When To Fully Read and Take Notes**

1. **In the Input Phase:**  
- **Skim** only to decide which parts of the source are worth deeper engagement.
- **Purpose here is triage:** Prioritize what to focus on and map the source.

1. **In the Processing Phase:**  
- **Fully read the prioritized sections** (or the entire chapter if relevant).
- Take **structured notes** while reading—this is the primary note-taking stage.
- The focus is on **capturing, organizing, and reflecting**.

1. **In the Synthesis Phase:**  
- **No full reading required here.**  
- Instead, **work from your structured notes** to refine ideas into atomic notes.

### **Illustrative Example: Reading a Chapter**

#### **1. Input Phase: Skimming**

- Source: A chapter on "The Eisenhower Matrix" from a time management book.
- Actions:
- Skim headings: "What is the Eisenhower Matrix," "How to Apply It," "Case Studies."
- Highlight key sentences: "The matrix divides tasks into four quadrants based on urgency and importance."
- Mark relevant sections for deeper reading: "What is the Eisenhower Matrix" and "How to Apply It."

**Output:**  
- Decision: Fully read the sections "What is the Eisenhower Matrix" and "How to Apply It."
- Question: "How does the matrix prioritize tasks for long-term goals?"

#### **2. Processing Phase: Full Reading & Structured Notes**

- Actions:
- Fully read the marked sections.
- Take Cornell-style notes:
- **Cue Column:** "Urgency vs. Importance," "Quadrants," "Case Studies."
- **Main Notes:** Detailed explanation of quadrants, examples, and benefits.
- **Summary:** The Eisenhower Matrix helps prioritize tasks by separating urgent from important.

**Output:**  
- Structured notes with clear summaries, keywords, and reflections.

#### **3. Synthesis Phase: Conceptual Notes**

- Actions:
- Break the structured notes into atomic notes, e.g.:
- **Note 1:** "What is the Eisenhower Matrix?"
- **Note 2:** "How to Use the Eisenhower Matrix."
- **Note 3:** "Benefits and Challenges of the Eisenhower Matrix."
- Use Input → Process → Output for each note:
- **Input:** Summarize relevant points from structured notes.
- **Process:** Reflect on how it connects to your work/life.
- **Output:** Define key takeaways and actionable steps.

**Output:**  
- Three atomic notes, fully processed and interconnected.

### **Guidelines For Each Stage**

| **Stage**       | **When to Read**                    | **When to Take Notes**              | **Key Focus**                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Input Phase**  | Skim or scan for relevance.         | Minimal annotations or observations.| Prioritize what to read deeply.               |
| **Processing Phase** | Fully read prioritized sections.    | Take structured notes (Cornell or similar).| Organize, summarize, and refine information.   |
| **Synthesis Phase**  | No additional reading.            | Create atomic notes from structured notes. | Break down ideas, analyze, and interconnect.   |

---

### **Why This Workflow Works**

- **Efficiency:** Skimming in the Input Phase prevents wasting time on irrelevant sections.
- **Depth:** Full reading in the Processing Phase ensures thorough engagement with important material.
- **Synthesis:** Conceptual notes in the Synthesis Phase enable critical thinking and reusable knowledge.

This staged approach balances speed and depth, ensuring your notes are intentional, actionable, and valuable. Let me know if you'd like further clarification or examples!
