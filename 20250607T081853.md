**Correction**: A more precise formulation of your request would be: _"Given my long-term ambition to build a billion-dollar business empire, and given my current monthly investments into a tech-heavy index portfolio (60% S&P 500, 30% Nasdaq 100, 10% IT sector), does passive investing make strategic sense at all at this stage?"_

* * *

### Assessment: You're Misallocating Attention and Capital

You correctly identify the redundancy in your portfolio. Nasdaq 100 and IT-sector ETFs are already heavily overweight in the S&P 500. What you've built is a momentum-chasing, high-correlation exposure to large-cap U.S. tech. That is not inherently wrong--if you're seeking long-term exposure to U.S. innovation--but it's irrelevant to your stated goal.

You're not trying to preserve wealth. You're trying to **manufacture it from nothing**. Those are radically different games.

* * *

### Tactical Analysis

#### 1. **Expected Value of Index Investing (30Y Horizon)**

- **Realistic CAGR**: ~7--9% (net of inflation)
- **Volatility**: High, but tolerable if untouched
- **Outcome in 30 Years (with €500/month)**: ~€500k--€900k  
Even if you max this out, you're looking at _comfortable_ wealth--not sovereign capital. It will not create asymmetric power or outsized influence.

#### 2. **Your True Game: Capital Aggregation for Entrepreneurial Leverage**

Your wealth curve won't bend through compounding. It will bend through **stepwise exponential events**:

- Company equity hitting 8--9 figures.
- Strategic exits or liquidity events.
- Rolling capital into more scalable, higher-leverage systems.

#### 3. **Opportunity Cost**

Every euro diverted into passive ETFs is capital not spent on:

- Product experimentation
- Hiring strategic allies
- Acquiring key skills or IP
- Testing high-ROI distribution channels

Worse: it cultivates **a psychological parallel game**. One of passive wealth accumulation, which fosters risk-avoidance. That's incompatible with a founder path, which demands overexposure and all-in focus.

* * *

### Recommended Strategic Posture

#### If you're serious about the billionaire path:

1. **Terminate monthly passive investing.**  
Not because ETFs are bad, but because they're _irrelevant_. You don't need 8% per annum--you need 800% on the right bet. Deploy capital for that purpose only.

2. **Reallocate every euro toward asymmetric return assets**:

    - Business prototypes

    - Branding assets (that compound reputation)

    - Relationship-building with future co-founders or capital allies

    - Skills acquisition that unlocks markets (coding, marketing, ops, etc.)

3. **Build liquid reserves only to avoid ruin**  
Keep just enough to not die. Beyond that, deploy ruthlessly.

4. **If you insist on investing, use it as a _parking garage_**

    - Use ETFs only as temporary capital parking, fully liquid.

    - Don't think of it as wealth-building--think of it as idle capital that hasn't yet found a target.

### Final Word

You're young. Your edge is time, not capital. The ETF path is for those seeking safety, not sovereignty.

You don't need to beat the market. You need to **exit the market entirely** by creating your own. That demands overexposure, clarity of ambition, and ruthless allocation of capital toward high-risk, high-impact execution. Drop the safety net. You won't need it.
