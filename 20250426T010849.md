### Berkshire Hathaway: the minimalist portrait

| Feature | Essence |
|---------|---------|
| **Core model** | Permanent holding company that owns (a) wholly-controlled operating businesses and (b) large minority stakes in listed firms. |
| **Capital engine** | Giant, low-cost insurance “float” (premium cash held before claims) + retained earnings from subsidiaries. |
| **Operating philosophy** | • Tiny corporate staff • No central synergies, marketing or HR • Managers run their businesses autonomously • Capital is re-allocated by the holding based on ­ROIC prospects. |
| **Cultural glue** | Trust, integrity, ultra-long horizon; reputation of Buffett & Munger substitutes for heavy governance. |

## Does the Berkshire archetype fit Eupator’s purpose?

| Dimension | Berkshire model | Eupator’s stated intent | Fit? | Comments |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|------|----------|
| **Strategic aim** | Compound shareholder capital over decades. | Build & scale high-performance ventures, prove the Corpus doctrine. | **Partial** | Both value long horizons, but Eupator’s goal is *process* leadership, not pure capital compounding. |
| **Operating role** | Almost *zero* central ops; no playbooks forced on subs. | Corpus Method **does** impose governance, form & initiative standards. | **Conflict** | Berkshire prizes autonomy over standardisation; Eupator’s edge is standardisation. |
| **Capital engine** | Insurance float = cheap leverage. | No insurance float yet. Capital likely comes from equity partners or cash-flowing ventures. | **Weak** | Unless Eupator acquires/launches an insurer, it lacks Berkshire’s fuel. |
| **Internal bank** | Yes: profits + float are re-deployed to buy new businesses or fund existing subs. | Eupator could allocate capital to portfolio firms under Corpus governance. | **Strong** | Corpus diagnostics would make capital allocation more data-driven than Berkshire’s “Buffett intuition.” |
| **Head-count** | ~30 people at HQ. | Corpus Core alone needs ±8–10 FTE (steward, diagnostics, SOP ops, etc.). | **Acceptable** | Still lean, just not *as* lean. |
| **Geography** | Primarily US. | Europe-focused (regulatory & multi-currency complexity). | **Nuanced** | Must handle EU labour law, GDPR, multiple tax regimes. |

## Rational path to a “Berkshire Hathaway-style” Eupator

| Step | Adaptation | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **1. Capital flywheel** | Replace “insurance float” with **operating-cash float**:<br>• Recapitalise early ventures that throw off cash.<br>• Set dividend policy: 70 % upstream to Eupator, 30 % reinvest in sub. | Generates a predictable internal bank without insurance risk. |
| **2. Corpus-light for mature acquisitions** | For wholly-acquired legacy firms, apply only **Governance + Form** layers (to secure reporting & risk), leave Initiative local. | Prevents choking seasoned managers with startup-style SOPs. |
| **3. Corpus-full for greenfield ventures** | Brand-new companies must pass full Corpus diagnostic and launch blueprint. | Keeps the “playbook advantage” where it works best—0→1 ventures. |
| **4. Central allocation office** | Small “Capital & Doctrine” unit that: <br>• Runs quarterly Corpus scorecards on each sub.<br>• Decides capital re-allocation based on score + ROIC. | Mirrors Berkshire’s capital council but adds structural metrics. |
| **5. Licensing revenue (optional)** | Let external SMEs adopt the Corpus Method for a fee; treat that cash like Berkshire treats float. | Creates a non-insurance float equivalent—recurring, low-capital revenue. |

## Pros & cons of a Berkshire-style trajectory

| Pros | Cons / Risks |
|------|--------------|
| • Corpus diagnostics make Eupator a **smarter allocator** than traditional conglomerates. | • No cheap float unless you launch/acquire an insurer or large cash-flow utility. |
| • Lean HQ possible; high ROIC if you pick disciplined deals. | • European labour/tax law adds friction vs. Berkshire’s US simplicity. |
| • Autonomous subs + light doctrinal guard-rails avoid micro-management. | • Investors may doubt “standardisation + autonomy” can coexist—needs case evidence. |
| • “Internal bank” narrative attractive to founders who fear VC liquidation prefs. | • Acquisition prices in Europe often higher (private-equity competition). |
| • Potential to become **the** long-term home for Mittelstand heirs lacking succession. | • Cultural glue (Buffett-like trust halo) must be earned; Corpus alone doesn’t grant it. |

## Verdict

- **Berkshire as *capital engine*** → **yes, adapt:**  
  *Create a lean central steward-bank that recycles cash across portfolio companies.*

- **Berkshire as *hands-off philosophy*** → **no, keep Corpus edge:**  
  *Retain standardised Governance/Form layers; flex Initiative per context.*

**Therefore:** Eupator can become the “Berkshire-Hathaway-of-Europe-with-an-Operating-System.”  
It won’t replicate the insurance float, but it can marry *long-horizon capital* with *Corpus-driven structural discipline*—a combination neither PE funds nor classic conglomerates currently offer.

Next action: draft a “Capital & Doctrine Office” mandate—defines dividend sweep, corpus scoring thresholds for reinvestment, and M&A filters (ROIC + Corpus fit ≥ x).
