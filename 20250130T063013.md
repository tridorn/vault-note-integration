Precisely, but letâ€™s refine the phrasing to ensure absolute clarity and alignment with the system:

- **Deliverables**: These are **sub-steps** or actionable components of tasks, designed to fit into **half-hour timeframes**.  
  - Example: "Draft the introduction paragraph for a report" or "Sketch the homepage wireframe layout."
  
- **Tasks and Outcomes**: The **task** represents the larger action (e.g., "Complete homepage wireframe"), while the **outcome** defines its functional result (e.g., "A usable wireframe ready for feedback"). Both are **timeboxed on a daily level**, meaning you plan to complete them within the day's work allocation.  
  - Example: "Deliver a functional homepage wireframe by the end of the day."

- **Iterations**: Represent **weekly milestones**, aiming to produce an incremental MVP for the project. The iteration consolidates the tasks and outcomes completed during the week into a functional deliverable.  
  - Example: "Deliver MVP wireframes for three core pages (Home, About, Contact) by the end of the week."

- **Milestones**: These sit on **monthly or quarterly levels**, representing major project goals or deliverables. They track the cumulative progress of multiple iterations.  
  - Example: "Deliver a functional MVP website by the end of the month."

### **How This Maps to Timeframes**

1. **Half-Hour Level (Deliverables)**:
	- Focus: **What tangible progress can be made in 30 minutes?**
	- Example: "Sketch basic layout of homepage wireframe."

2. **Daily Level (Tasks & Outcomes)**:
	- Focus: **What functional result will I deliver today?**
	- Example: "Complete a draft of the homepage wireframe."

3. **Weekly Level (Iterations)**:
	- Focus: **What incremental MVP will I deliver by the end of the week?**
	- Example: "Deliver MVP wireframes for Home, About, and Contact pages."

4. **Higher Levels (Milestones)**:
	- Focus: **What major goal am I achieving this month/quarter?**
	- Example: "Complete functional MVP of the entire website."

### **Practical Workflow Example**

#### **1. Milestone (Monthly/Quarterly Goal)**

- **Goal**: Deliver a functional MVP website by Dec. 31.

#### **2. Iteration (Weekly Goal)**

- **Iteration 1**: Create MVP wireframes for three core pages (Home, About, Contact) by Dec. 11.

#### **3. Tasks & Outcomes (Daily Goals)**

- **Task for Monday**: Complete homepage wireframe.
  - **Outcome**: A draft homepage wireframe ready for feedback.

#### **4. Deliverables (Half-Hour Sub-Steps)**

- Monday's Timeboxed Blocks:
  - Block 1: Sketch the basic layout.
  - Block 2: Add placeholders for text and images.
  - Block 3: Annotate user navigation paths.
  - Block 4: Review and finalize for feedback.

### **Key Adjustments for Your Workflow**

1. **Granularity by Timeframe**:
	- Plan **deliverables** within half-hour blocks.
	- Define **tasks and outcomes** for daily execution.
	- Set **iterations** as weekly targets.
	- Align all iterations with higher-level milestones.

2. **Iterative MVP Thinking**:
	- Each timeframe builds incrementally toward the MVP:
	  - **Half-hour**: Sub-step progress.
	  - **Day**: Functional outcomes.
	  - **Week**: Iterative MVP.
	  - **Month/Quarter**: Major milestone.

3. **Prioritize Functionality Over Perfection**:
	- Ensure each **deliverable** and **outcome** meets the minimal functionality required for progress, avoiding over-polishing early on.

This system ensures that every action is connected to a clear timeframe and level of granularity, balancing rapid progress with incremental refinement.
