The **Leadership Council**'s role becomes even more **strategic, directional, and integrative** in nature when the **Adaptive General Staff (AGS)** takes over much of the internal operational planning and execution support. This division of responsibilities allows the Leadership Council to focus on **big-picture leadership**, ensuring the company’s **long-term vision** and **strategic coherence** while delegating detailed operational work to the AGS.

Below is a detailed breakdown of **what the Leadership Council does on a day-to-day basis** in a company with the **Adaptive Command Matrix (ACM)** and an established AGS.

### **5. Leadership Council Dynamics**

#### **A. Collaboration**
The Leadership Council functions as a **collaborative body**, not a traditional hierarchical structure. Each member brings expertise from their domain (e.g., strategy, finance, technology) and works collaboratively to:
- Shape strategic objectives.
- Monitor alignment across all domains of the company.

#### **B. Decision-Making**
- **Distributed Authority**: Individual members are empowered to make decisions within their domain, reducing bottlenecks.
- **Collective Consensus**: For large-scale decisions (e.g., entering new markets), the Council collaborates, relying on AGS input to ensure informed decision-making.

#### **C. Feedback Loops**
- The **AGS** provides real-time feedback on how strategies are being operationalized.
- Regular check-ins with LFOs offer the Council additional insights into on-the-ground dynamics.

### **6. What the Leadership Council Does **Not** Do**
With the AGS handling internal operations, the Leadership Council avoids:
1. **Tactical Involvement**:
   - The Council does not manage daily mission execution or interfere with AMU autonomy.
2. **Micromanagement**:
   - The Council trusts the AGS to oversee mission details and intervenes only for strategic realignment.
3. **Resource Logistics**:
   - Decisions about specific resource deployments (e.g., personnel or operational tools) are delegated to the AGS and OCDs.

### **7. Summary: Leadership Council as Strategic Stewards**
With the AGS assuming operational responsibilities, the Leadership Council evolves into **true stewards of strategy and culture**, focusing on:
- Defining the **long-term vision** and strategic objectives.
- Maintaining alignment across the **company ecosystem**.
- Engaging with external stakeholders to grow the company’s influence and opportunities.
- Monitoring **performance metrics** and making high-level adjustments as needed.

By stepping back from day-to-day operational concerns, the Leadership Council ensures that the company remains **forward-looking, adaptable, and aligned with its mission-driven ethos**. This separation of concerns allows the ACM to function efficiently while retaining **strategic coherence at the top.**
