### Eupator’s structural choice: **“Operating-holding + optional evergreen fund”**  
Below is a concrete, jurisdiction-sensible model for a Zürich-based builder that wants Berkshire-style permanence **and** the option to manage outside capital.

---

## 1 Top-level stack (legal & ownership)

| Layer | Entity | Jurisdiction | Purpose |
|-------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Dynastic vehicle** | **Liechtenstein Stiftung** (or Swiss family foundation if law is re-enacted in 2026) | Liechtenstein | Owns > 90 % of Eupator Holding; shields personal estate, allows perpetual mission clauses. |
| **Operating holding** | **Eupator Holding AG** | Switzerland (Zug / Zurich) | • Keeps core IP (Corpus Principia) • Holds 100 % of studio & shared-service pods • Coinvests alongside any future fund. |
| **Studio subsidiary** | Eupator Studio GmbH | Germany (for hiring & spin-outs) | Green-field venture factory running full Corpus stack. |
| **Shared-service pods** | Brand Pod GmbH, People Pod GmbH … | Same as Studio | Cross-venture cost centres; can invoice at arm’s-length. |
| **Fund manager (optional)** | **Eupator Capital S.à r.l.** (AIFM-light) | Luxembourg RAIF/SCSp | General Partner & AIFM for external evergreen fund. |

*Why Switzerland at apex?*: dividend participation exemption, strong holding regime, easy multi-currency banking; still inside European economic orbit.  
*Why Luxembourg for fund?*: LP-friendly, passportable EU vehicle, light AIFMD for < €100 m.

## 2 Capital architecture

### Internal bank loop (phase 1 – 3 years)
1. Launch 2-3 cash-flow-positive ventures from Studio.  
2. 70 % of free cash is dividended to Eupator AG.  
3. AG recycles cash into:  
   - next green-field launch, or  
   - bolt-on Mittelstand acquisition via SPV GmbH.  

No outside dilution yet—founder retains control via foundation.

### Evergreen co-investment fund (phase 2 – 5 years)
- LPs (family offices, UHNW) commit to **Eupator Evergreen I** (target €50-100 m).  
- GP = Eupator Capital; carries 10-15 % performance fee.  
- Fund buys 20-40 % stakes in new Studio spin-outs **and** minority tranches in bolt-on SMEs.  
- Eupator AG always coinvests ≥ 20 % in every deal to keep alignment.

> Result: you obtain Berkshire-like capital ammunition *without* issuing common shares.

## 3 How ventures slot in

| Build type | Vehicle | Ownership pattern | Corpus depth | Exit logic |
|------------|---------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Green-field** | New GmbH (DE) / AG (CH) | 60 % Holding / 30 % Fund / 10 % Founding team | **Full Corpus** (all layers) | Hold or list; dividends preferred |
| **SME buy-out** | SPV GmbH (DE) | 51 % Holding / 39 % Fund / 10 % Sellers rollover | **Governance + light Form** only | Dividend play; optional resale to strategic |
| **Minority growth stake** | Fund direct | 0 % Holding / 100 % Fund | Advisory Corpus (Governance/Form audit) | Exit in 5-7 yrs |

---

## 4 Scaling the workforce

| Stage | Core HQ (Holding) | Studio & Pods | Fund side |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Year 1** | 4–6 FTE (Steward, CFO, Legal/Ops, Corpus architect) | 8–12 engineers & venture leads | outsourced AIFM-lite |
| **Year 3 (≥ 4 ventures)** | 10–12 | 25–30 | 4 (deal team, analyst, GP legal) |
| **Year 6 (10+ ventures)** | 18–20 | 60–70 (pods replicate) | 8–10 (second fund launch) |

All hiring follows **Corpus Form presets** (role cards, modal norms); cross-venture transfers keep knowledge in-house.

---

## 5 Funding / dilution decisions

| Option | Dilution? | Control impact | When to use |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Sell equity in Holding AG** | Yes (common / preferred shares) | Board seats, reporting duties | Only if strategic anchor investor brings permanent capital & network. |
| **Launch external RAIF evergreen fund** | No dilution of Holding | GP/LP structure; Holding keeps carry + coinvest rights | Preferred route to scale capital while preserving governance purity. |
| **Convertible notes at venture level** | Dilutes *only* that spin-out | Holding retains majority if note converts below 35 % | For capital-intensive verticals (deep-tech) where LP fund not enough. |

**Recommendation**: preserve Holding cap-table; scale via RAIF + venture-level securities.

## 6 Why this beats “classic VC” or “plain PE”

| Dimension | Classic VC | Classic PE | Eupator model |
|-----------|------------|------------|---------------|
| Holding horizon | 5–10 yrs | 3–7 yrs | ∞ (foundation) |
| Operating playbook | Minimal | Financial engineering | **Corpus OS** applied from day-0 |
| Capital source | LP fund only | Leverage + fund | Hybrid: internal cash + evergreen LP fund |
| Integration cost | NA | High (synergy plans) | Low—ventures pre-aligned via Corpus |
| Talent magnet | Option packages | Cash incentives | **Role/career portability + structure clarity** |

You grow by **compounding structurally de-risked earnings** and **re-deploying them faster** than rivals who must rebuild governance each time.

### Immediate next actions  
1. **Legal check**: Swiss holding + Liechtenstein foundation feasibility (tax counsel).  
2. **Draft Evergreen I teaser**: Corpus thesis + three-loop flywheel slide.  
3. **Open SPV templates**: ready GmbH / AG documents in Docusign for first spin-out.

With that, you pivot Eupator from “idea” to “institutional launcher + allocator”— without losing Corpus as its central differentiator.
