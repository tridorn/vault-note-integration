### Executive-Grade Taxonomy of Executional Artifacts  
*(A pragmatic framework for entrepreneurs and organisational engineers)*  

---

#### 0.  Ontological Axes  -- *Why we segment*  
Any artifact that instructs, enables, or records execution can be positioned against three non-negotiable dimensions:  

| Axis | Question Resolved | Typical Spectrum |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| **Authority** | *Does it impose, facilitate, or evidence?* | Governing ⇄ Enabling ⇄ Evidencing |
| **Temporal Horizon** | *How stable is its content?* | Charter (years) ⇄ Sprint Backlog (weeks) ⇄ Run-Log (minutes) |
| **Granularity of Action** | *How close to the actor's hand?* | Enterprise-wide ⇄ Work-Cell ⇄ Individual Step |

These axes inform, but do not themselves constitute, the taxonomy. They allow rapid mapping and gap-spotting once the cohorts below are in place.

---

#### 1.  Governing Artifacts -- *Codify intent & boundary conditions*  
Purpose: anchor authority and risk posture; clarify "what must always / never happen."  

| Canonical Forms | Common Aliases | Cardinal Failure if Missing |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Policies** | Guardrails, Maxims | Compliance drift |
| **Standards** | Minimum Acceptable Level (MAL) | Quality entropy |
| **Charters** | Mandates, Articles of Mission | Scope sprawl |

*Trade-off*: Excess detail ossifies; too little produces interpretive chaos.

---

#### 2.  Mobilisation Artifacts -- *Translate intent into organised motion*  
Purpose: synchronise disparate actors and temporal layers.  

| Canonical Forms | Common Aliases | Leverage Point |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Strategies & Roadmaps** | North-Star Plan, Portfolio Map | Capital allocation |
| **Operating Models** | Target Operating State | Structure-process fit |
| **RACI Matrices / Accountability Maps** | Role Grids | Conflict pre-emption |

*Insight*: These artifacts earn power by *constraining options* to those most leverage-efficient.

---

#### 3.  Procedural Artifacts -- *Describe the invariant choreography*  
Purpose: make the how‐to non-negotiable where variance is toxic (safety, regulatory, margin‐critical steps).  

| Canonical Forms | Common Aliases | Decision Consequence |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** | Work Instructions | Throughput stability |
| **Process Maps / BPMN Diagrams** | Swim-lane Flowcharts | Cross-functional latency |
| **Run-books & Playbooks** | Incident Guide | MTTR reduction |

*Trade-off*: The tighter the script, the higher the maintenance tax when context shifts.

---

#### 4.  Enabling Artifacts -- *Put tools in the operator's hand*  
Purpose: minimise cognitive load at execution time; embed single-source-of-truth data or templates.  

| Canonical Forms | Common Aliases | Key Utility |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Templates & Checklists** | Cheatsheets | Error damping |
| **Dashboards (live)** | Scoreboards | On-the-spot prioritisation |
| **Automation Scripts / Macros** | Bots | Speed-variance decoupling |

*Leverage*: Converts expert tacit knowledge into scalable, low-variance routines.

---

#### 5.  Evidencing Artifacts -- *Render execution observable & improvable*  
Purpose: close the loop between assumption and actuality; feed governance and learning cycles.  

| Canonical Forms | Common Aliases | Strategic Payoff |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Performance Reports & KPI Packs** | Ops Review Deck | Early weak-signal detection |
| **Audit Trails / Logs** | Trace Files | Regulatory shield |
| **Post-Mortems / AARs** | Retrospectives | Continuous design reflex |

*Observation*: Without disciplined evidencing, you are steering one quarter late and one metric short.

---

### How to Use the Taxonomy  

1. **Inventory** every artifact you possess; locate it along the three axes, then sort into the five cohorts.  
2. **Cluster** duplicates bearing different names; retain the artifact whose authority is recognised by the execution layer.  
3. **Cull or Elevate**:  
 * Governing artifacts fewer than five are usually inadequate; more than fifteen signals bureaucratic creep.  
 * Mobilisation artifacts must be mutually non-contradictory--one roadmap trumps three competing slide decks.  
4. **Version Discipline** -- assign explicit owners per cohort:  
 * Chief Risk Officer ➟ Governing  
 * COO / PMO ➟ Mobilisation & Procedural  
 * Domain Leads ➟ Enabling  
 * CFO / Data Office ➟ Evidencing  
5. **Feedback Loop** -- Evidencing outputs should trigger scheduled revisions of Procedural and Mobilisation cohorts; neglect this and artifacts ossify into ritual.

### Strategic Pay-off  

A clear taxonomy is not clerical elegance; it is *power projection*:  

* **Speed** -- Operators find the right instruction in seconds, not meetings.  
* **Alignment** -- Investors, regulators, and staff read from one canon.  
* **Optionality** -- When a pivot is forced, you know precisely which artifacts to rewrite and which remain authoritative.

Deploy it and you convert architectural clarity into executional velocity--an asymmetry your competitors will notice only in the lagging indicator: market share.
