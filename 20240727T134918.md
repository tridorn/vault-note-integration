### General Guidelines

- **Explosive Movements**: Typically require longer rest periods (90 seconds to 2 minutes) to ensure maximum power output.
- **Strength and Hypertrophy**: Rest periods of 60-90 seconds between sets and around 2 minutes between exercises are optimal.
- **Endurance and HIIT**: Shorter rest periods (15-60 seconds) are typical to maintain an elevated heart rate and improve cardiovascular endurance.
- **Speed and Agility**: Rest periods should be long enough to maintain technique and speed, usually around 60 seconds between sets and 1.5 minutes between exercises.

Adjust the rest periods based on your fitness level and how your body responds to the workouts. Longer rest might be needed initially, with shorter periods as you adapt and improve your conditioning.
