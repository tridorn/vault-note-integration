Better: "Assess the trade-offs of index cards versus traditional paper for book and idea note-taking, then design a structured, ID-driven index card system optimised for atomic capture, later distillation, and integration with a digital markdown library."

  

Here's the assessment and system.

* * *

## 1. Rational comparison -- index cards vs bound paper

  

Index cards advantages

- Atomicity: enforces one idea per unit, avoids cognitive clutter of multi-topic pages.
- Physical sortability: allows reordering, clustering, and removal without rewriting.
- Durability: stiffer material survives handling, pinning, pocket carry.
- Modularity: can mix different sizes or colors for categorisation without changing writing method.
- Immediate repurposability: same card can serve as capture, prompt, or display in different contexts.

  

Bound paper disadvantages in this use case

- Non-atomic: multiple ideas per page complicate reorganisation.
- Destructive editing: extracting one idea requires rewriting or photocopying.
- Cognitive inertia: tendency to keep sequential notes in fixed order, impedes re-clustering.

  

Trade-offs

- Bulk: cards take more space for the same number of words. Manage via disciplined culling.
- Loss risk: single card loss is contained but may be harder to notice until retrieval. Mitigate with regular digitisation.
- Cost per unit: slightly higher; offset by reduced total kept notes due to enforced selectivity.

## 2. Structured index card system

  

### 2.1 Physical specifications

- Size: A6 (105×148mm) for main notes; A7 (74×105mm) for ephemeral or temporary links.
- Paper weight: 200gsm+ for stiffness.
- Layout: blank front, dot-grid back for sketches or diagrams.
- Color coding (optional, but enforce consistently):

    - White: source-derived notes (books, articles, podcasts)

    - Yellow: self-generated concepts or strategies

    - Blue: experiments and metrics

    - Pink: questions or hypotheses
* * *

### 2.2 Metadata and ID system

  

Each card has a stable alphanumeric ID in the top-right corner:
    
    
    YYMMDD-HHMM-TAG

Example: 250814-0932-PRC (Aug 14, 2025, 09:32, pricing-related).

  

Bottom-left: source code (matches your markdown source ID) if relevant.

Bottom-right: short tag(s), 1--3 letters for fast visual sorting.

* * *

### 2.3 Card types

  

Keep a minimal typology, aligned with your markdown schema:

1. Claim -- factual or argued statement from a source.

2. Principle -- cross-context generalisation.

3. Pattern -- situation--response template.

4. Metric -- definition or guardrail.

5. Play -- executable tactic.

6. Counterexample -- documented failure mode.

7. Question -- open issue needing resolution.

8. Quote -- exact wording for rhetorical power.
* * *

### 2.4 Front--back usage

- Front: core idea, succinct, one or two sentences.
- Back: evidence, context, source location, quick sketch if applicable.
* * *

### 2.5 Daily operational flow

1. Capture: While reading or thinking, write one idea per card. Assign provisional ID immediately (date + hour-minute).

2. Staging: Place new cards into a daily capture stack.

3. Distillation (end of day or next morning): refine wording, ensure type classification, add missing metadata.

4. Linking: If connections emerge, write cross-reference IDs directly on the card edges.

5. Digitisation: Photograph or scan all distilled cards, save into _inbox for markdown transcription.

* * *

### 2.6 Weekly integration

- Select only high-signal cards to encode digitally. Target ≤30% retention.
- In markdown, replicate card content in atomic note format, preserving original ID.
- Update maps or project files with relevant new links.
- Physically file kept cards in topic-sorted boxes (using tabbed dividers).
* * *

### 2.7 Filing logic

  

Physical storage

- Use durable card boxes with alphabetical or topical dividers.
- Keep active projects in a portable deck holder for quick shuffling and review.

  

Digital mirror

- Match physical dividers with /maps/ in your markdown library.
- Digital linking extends beyond physical filing, allowing one card's content to appear in multiple topic maps.
* * *

### 2.8 Review and culling cadence

- Daily: Distil and tag new cards.
- Weekly: Integrate, digitise, cull.
- Monthly: Pull 10--15 cards from archives, assess ongoing relevance, remove dead weight.
- Quarterly: Re-cluster all physical cards by current priority topics; retire inactive clusters to deep archive.
* * *

### 2.9 Special practices for leverage

- Mobile capture kit: small card wallet + pen, always on you.
- Board integration: pin active project cards on wallboards for visual workflow.
- Index anchors: create a "map card" per major topic that lists 5--10 related card IDs for quick physical lookup.
- Experiment chains: group sequential experiment cards with binder clips for one-hand flipping.
* * *

### 2.10 Trade-offs and mitigation

- Card loss: mitigate by daily digitisation.
- Overflow: enforce hard limits per category; force replacement instead of addition once the limit is reached.
- Duplication: merge in distillation phase before digital encoding.

If you want, I can next design a starter kit layout: a portable deck, filing box, divider scheme, and the exact template printing you can run on blank A6 cards so your analogue and digital metadata are 1:1 from day one. This would let you deploy the system without any later reformatting.
