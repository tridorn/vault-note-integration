Tasks are created and updated in Apple Reminders. They will be set to in-progress accordingly, signifying which tasks area worked on, currently. 

Time planning orients itself on these base tasks. It sets daily objectives which are states to achieve, without the granular action-based formulation of tasks. Objectives will also be set in the half-hour timeframes, but only one for each respectively. Dynamic timeframes between day and half-hour timeframe can be created, they do not hold objectives, but checklists. Checklists are a list of actions that aren't entered as tasks in Apple Reminders (only the Checklist itself forms a task) but still have the same action characteristics that tasks are formulated in mind with. These dynamic timeframes are purely to complete the checklist, any tracking such documentation on what I did, even during the time of the dynamic timeframes is purely done in the half-hour timeframes and day timeframes. During the time of the dynamic timeframes I am still going to be setting half-hour objectives and filling its document as usual, it's just that I have to take the checklists into account
