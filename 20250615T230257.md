You should have asked: _"Given my lean setup--early-stage, few users, long-term strategic ambition--what are the unavoidable recurring costs for operating the core spine, and what optional expenses could be deferred without compromising architectural integrity?"_

* * *

## I. Profile Constraints (Stated or Implied)

| Dimension | Assumption | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Stage** | Post-incorporation, pre-revenue, structurally serious | 
| **Team size** | ≤ 10 core contributors | 
| **Location** | Germany (EU data jurisdiction applies) | 
| **Time horizon** | Long-term ambition, short-term capital sensitivity | 
| **Priority** | Avoid structural debt, avoid bloated overhead | 
* * *

## II. Fixed Costs -- _Minimal Viable Operational Stack_

| Component | Tool | Tier | Monthly Cost | Notes | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Git host + CI** | GitHub Team (10 seats) | $4/user | $40 | Enterprise plan ($21/user) only when org scales | 
| **Object vault** | Cloudflare R2 | Usage-based | ~$5--20 | Free up to 10 GB; assume 50--100 GB at scale | 
| **Database** | Neon (Postgres) | Pro (or Free) | $0--25 | Free tier viable early; auto-pause saves cost | 
| **Infra state** | Terraform Cloud | Free | $0 | Scales to 500 resources before needing paid | 
| **Identity provider** | Google Workspace Business | €6--12/user | ~€60--120 | Optional to start with consumer Gmail | 
| **GUI (Retool)** | Retool Cloud (free) | Free or $10/editor | $0--100 | Can delay--CLI/manual Git edits work | 
| **Dashboards** | Metabase Cloud / self-hosted | Free / $85 | $0--85 | Self-host = free but needs compute | 
| **Audit logging** | Grafana Loki + storage | Variable | ~$5--30 | Optional early; critical later | 

**Core Stack Total (lean mode):**  
→ _Minimum viable_: **$50--80/month**  
→ _With basic GUI, dashboards, infra polish_: **$150--250/month**

* * *

## III. Optional / Delayed Costs

| Category | Tool | Notes | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Self-hosted runners** | GitHub-hosted minutes are free-ish; self-host once cost spikes |  | 
| **Dedicated CI containers** | Use public GitHub runners first; optimize later |  | 
| **Advanced access control** | Okta/JumpCloud only when Google Workspace RBAC insufficient |  | 
| **Backup tooling** | Use Neon auto-backups and R2 versioning for now |  | 
| **Slack paid tier** | Archive limits only matter after 90 days; delay payment |  | 
* * *

## IV. One-Time Costs / Setup Time

| Action | Time (Solo) | Optional Spend | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Infrastructure bootstrapping | 15--20 hours | $0 (if self-setup) | 
| Domain + DNS setup | 2--4 hours | ~$15/year | 
| GitHub CI pipelines | 10 hours (1-time) | -- | 
| Legal/finance integration (e.g. DATEV) | N/A | Possibly handled by accountant | 

* * *

## V. Cost Management Levers

| Tactic | Result | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Use free tiers with built-in soft limits (Neon, R2, Terraform) | Avoids early bloat | 
| Centralize billing under one GSuite | Easier team management and audits | 
| Defer GUI-heavy tools until workflows stabilize | Avoid premature interface lock-in | 
| Mirror assets into Git when small (<10 MB) | Reduces need for R2 early on | 
| Keep bots and CI stateless, bursty | Avoid idle compute cost | 

* * *

### Bottom Line

| Phase | Monthly Ops Cost | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Day 1--90 (lean, CLI-driven)** | **~€50--80** | 
| **Day 90--180 (first GUI, dashboards)** | **~€150--250** | 
| **Post-scale (25+ users, policies)** | **~€500--800**+ | 

You can run a **strategically coherent, versioned, auditable operation** with <€100/month burn early on. Spend grows as **load and compliance grow**, not arbitrarily. This is the opposite of legacy SaaS bloat.
