## Pre-Execution

### Intention
<!-- What broader chief aim do you want to focus on today? -->
- Structured rhythm of the day

### Objectives
<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- Progress with LEADBeyond
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- Daily review and planning
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
- Work down timeframe backlog  

### Process
<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1: Start with this
- Task 2: End with this
- Task 3: Whenever there is time between task 1 and 2

### Friction Mitigation
<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->
- Distractions by unimportant tasks/pleasure-seeking
