The essence of **Auftragstaktik** in a business context can be distilled into four key pieces of information that a leader communicates to their subordinates:

---

### 1. **The Desired Outcome (End-State):**
   - What is the goal?  
   - Example: "We need a 20% increase in customer retention by the end of Q2."  

   The leader provides a clear vision of the outcome without dictating the specific steps to achieve it. This ensures everyone understands the overarching purpose of their efforts.

---

### 2. **Key Constraints (Boundaries):**
   - What limitations or rules must be adhered to?  
   - Example: "Stick to the existing budget and avoid changes to core product features."  

   These define the non-negotiables, ensuring autonomy does not lead to actions that undermine broader objectives or violate critical principles.

---

### 3. **The Strategic Context (Why):**
   - Why is this important? How does it align with the larger mission?  
   - Example: "Improving customer retention is crucial to increasing recurring revenue and ensuring sustainable growth in the next funding round."  

   This ensures subordinates grasp the strategic significance of their work and make decisions aligned with the larger organizational vision.

---

### 4. **Resources Available (Support):**
   - What tools, personnel, or support are at their disposal?  
   - Example: "You have access to the marketing team, the analytics dashboard, and $5,000 in discretionary funds for experimentation."  

   Clear articulation of available resources empowers subordinates to make informed decisions and maximizes their efficiency.

---

In sum, the leader’s directive in **Auftragstaktik** is not a step-by-step plan but a framework defined by:  
- **What to achieve,**  
- **What to avoid,**  
- **Why it matters,** and  
- **What’s available to help.**  

This clarity fosters autonomy, trust, and adaptability, enabling subordinates to execute the mission effectively within their sphere of influence.
