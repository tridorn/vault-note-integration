# About not to suppress emotions

Your question might be more precisely formulated as: *"To what extent should I suppress or force away negative or undesired emotions and thoughts in accordance with Stoic principles?"*

In Stoicism, the emphasis is not on **suppressing** or **forcing away** emotions, but rather on **understanding**, **managing**, and **transforming** them through reason. The goal is to cultivate an awareness of emotions without becoming controlled by them. Suppressing emotions outright would contradict Stoic teachings, as it would ignore the opportunity to learn from these emotional responses and weaken your capacity for self-mastery. Here’s how to approach negative or undesired emotions in more detail:

### 1. **Understanding Emotions Before Acting**
Stoicism teaches that emotions, especially negative ones, often arise from our judgments or perceptions about events, not from the events themselves. Emotions are signals of how we interpret reality, and they provide insight into what we value and believe. The first step is to **understand the emotion** before attempting to suppress or manage it.

- **Example**: Suppose you feel anger after a colleague disrespects you. Rather than immediately suppressing the anger, a Stoic would pause and ask, "Why am I angry? What belief or judgment led to this emotion?" This reflection reveals that your anger stems from the expectation that others should treat you in a certain way. By identifying the belief, you can work on reshaping it, rather than just forcing the anger away.

**Key Practice**: Take a moment to reflect on why the emotion has arisen. Don’t suppress it immediately—understand it first.

### 2. **Redirect Rather than Suppress**
Stoicism advocates **redirecting** emotions by examining them rationally and deciding whether they serve a virtuous purpose. Rather than pushing emotions aside, the Stoic asks, “Is this emotion in line with virtue?” If not, it should be redirected, not suppressed.

- **Example**: If you feel overwhelming anxiety about an upcoming presentation, a Stoic wouldn’t suggest pretending the anxiety doesn’t exist. Instead, you would ask yourself, “Is this anxiety helping me prepare? Or is it just based on fear of judgment?” Once you realize that the anxiety is rooted in external validation, you can refocus on what is within your control—doing your best, regardless of the outcome.

**Key Practice**: Ask whether the emotion is useful for acting virtuously. If it’s not, redirect your focus toward what you can control, rather than suppressing the feeling.

### 3. **Transform Emotions Through Reason**
Rather than suppressing negative emotions, Stoicism encourages the **transformation** of these emotions through rational thought. Emotions, especially destructive ones like anger or fear, are often based on faulty judgments about external events. By applying reason, you can reframe the situation and transform the emotional response.

- **Example**: If you’re frustrated because a personal project failed, instead of suppressing that frustration, a Stoic would reframe the situation: "This setback is a lesson, not a personal failure. How can I improve my approach in the future?" By reframing, the emotion of frustration is transformed into a sense of curiosity or determination.

**Key Practice**: Use reason to reframe emotional responses, transforming negative emotions into constructive attitudes.

### 4. **Acceptance of Emotions without Indulgence**
Stoicism teaches **acceptance** of emotions without indulging them. Negative emotions, such as sadness or frustration, are natural reactions to certain events, and the goal is not to eliminate all emotion but to prevent emotions from **controlling** your actions and thoughts.

- **Example**: If you are grieving the loss of a loved one, Stoicism does not ask you to suppress grief entirely. Instead, it encourages you to acknowledge the sadness but not allow it to lead to despair or irrational behavior. Marcus Aurelius often reflected on the natural course of life and death, accepting loss while continuing to act in accordance with virtue.

**Key Practice**: Acknowledge emotions, accept their presence, but do not allow them to dictate your behavior or perspective.

### 5. **Premeditatio Malorum: Preparing for Negative Emotions**
One of the Stoic techniques, *premeditatio malorum* (premeditation of evils), involves mentally preparing for potential negative events before they happen. This preparation allows you to reduce the emotional shock and respond with composure when negative situations arise.

- **Example**: Before a difficult conversation with a friend, you might imagine the worst-case scenario: that the conversation leads to conflict or misunderstanding. By preparing for this possibility, you are less likely to be emotionally overwhelmed if it happens. You have already accepted the potential outcome and are ready to face it with calmness and reason.

**Key Practice**: Regularly visualize potential negative events to reduce their emotional impact and ensure you can respond with equanimity.

### 6. **Choosing Between Destructive and Constructive Emotions**
Stoicism doesn’t advocate for eliminating all emotions but encourages distinguishing between **destructive** emotions, which arise from irrational judgments, and **constructive** emotions, which are based on rational and virtuous responses.

- **Example**: If you feel anger toward someone who has wronged you, a Stoic would recommend reflecting on whether the anger is destructive or constructive. If the anger drives you toward revenge or aggression, it is destructive and should be let go. However, if it inspires you to stand up for justice calmly and assertively, it becomes constructive.

**Key Practice**: Evaluate your emotions: Are they destructive, leading you away from virtue, or constructive, helping you act virtuously? Let go of the former and cultivate the latter.

### 7. **Using Apatheia (Inner Calm) to Moderate Emotions**
The Stoic concept of *apatheia* is not about suppressing emotions but reaching a state of inner calm and tranquility where emotions do not disturb your reasoned judgment. Through practice, Stoics aim to remain undisturbed by external events, neither overly elated by good fortune nor devastated by misfortune.

- **Example**: If you receive praise or criticism, Stoicism advises that you maintain *apatheia* by reminding yourself that neither is inherently good or bad—they are external judgments. You acknowledge them, but they do not sway your inner peace.

**Key Practice**: Cultivate *apatheia* by recognizing that external events and emotions are neutral. Practice keeping your inner state calm and undisturbed by external stimuli.

### Conclusion: Manage, Don’t Suppress
Stoicism teaches that negative emotions are natural, and the goal is not to suppress them but to manage and transform them through reason and self-awareness. **Suppressing** emotions outright can lead to unresolved inner conflict, whereas **managing** them allows for growth and deeper understanding of the self.

In practical terms:
- **Understand** why the emotion has arisen.
- **Redirect** your focus toward what you can control.
- **Reframe** the situation through rational reflection.
- **Accept** the emotion without indulging in it.
- **Prepare** mentally for negative events to reduce emotional impact.
- **Choose** between constructive and destructive emotions.
- **Cultivate apatheia** by maintaining inner tranquility regardless of external events.

Through these practices, you will learn to experience and manage emotions in a balanced way, rather than suppressing them or allowing them to overwhelm you.
