Below is a **single, canonical folder tree** for any project.  
It is **MECE** (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive) and mirrors the doctrine components you already adopted.  
Top-level numbers force natural ordering; sub-folders appear only when needed.

### Rationale for Each Top-Level Bucket

- **00_Core**  
Holds the living "brain" of the project. One glance answers _what the project is, where it stands, and how risky it is_.

- **10_Scope**  
Freezes _commitments_--scope, budgets, SLAs--so they can't drift silently.

- **20_Execution**  
Everything transient yet active: Mission branches, sprint exports, operational SOPs.

- **30_Resources**  
Shared inputs that multiple Missions will touch but never mutate in-place.

- **40_Data**  
Separates raw artefacts from transformed versions, preventing accidental overwrite.

- **50_Output**  
Clean split between drafts, client-ready material, and tagged public releases.

- **60_Logs**  
Immutable evidence--meeting minutes, CI traces--kept out of narrative files for clarity.

- **90_Archive**  
Auto-purge target for anything no longer live; keeps the active tree lean.

### How It Works Day-to-Day

1. **Clone** the repo locally; only ever work inside `missions/` on your branch.

2. **Add or edit** binary assets in `20_Execution/.../assets/` → tracked with Git LFS.

3. **Update** `MasterContent.md` and `DecisionLog.csv` whenever you change narrative or make a one-way decision.

4. **CI** enforces that any new file lands in the correct bucket; pushes will fail if misplaced.

5. **FO** merges mission branches back into `main`, generating release artefacts into `50_Output`.

6. **Archive script** moves dormant folders older than 180 days into `90_Archive`.

Result: every file has **exactly one home**, discoverability is instant, and privacy boundaries are clear.
