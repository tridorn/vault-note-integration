# Transition from Old to New Timeframe Ladder

## Assessment of Present Ladder

- **1/2 hour**: Smallest block, clean map to calendar, too granular for larger reviews, best for execution-only
- **Dynamic event (2-4 hours)**: Ill-defined, blurs hierarchy
- **Day**: Universal cognitive anchor
- **Week**: Natural review cadence, default/social calendar
- **Month**: Financial & operating reporting unit, variable length (28-31d) adds drift
- **Quarters (13 weeks)**: Industry-standard for OKRs, finance, long for rapid cycling
- **Year**: Strategic reorientation, tax & fiscal closure
- **5y/10y/50y/100y**: long-arc vision, distances seem arbitrary, little proportional logic and actionable sequencing between longer frames  

**Core Problems**
1. **Inconsistent progression ratio**: jumps vary from ×2 to ×10+
2. **Missing execution cycle**: no slot between month & quarter to house projects that outrun a sprint but don't justify quarter planning.
3. **"Dynamic event" is fuzzy**: hierarchy thrives on deterministic rungs; ambiguity breeds slippage.
4. **Long-arc ladder skips the 20-30 y epoch**: a critical horizon for life arcs or multi-decade ventures.

## Design Principles for a Superior Ladder

1. **Fixed ratio or small set of ratios**: keeps mental arithmetic trivial.
2. **Deterministic definitions**: every rung has clear length.
3. **Operationally useful review cadence**: each step must justify its own retrospective and planning ritual.
4. **Alignment with real-world triggers**: fiscal periods, product cycles, human attention spans.
5. **Built-in execution rhythm**:include a cycle tailored to intense output (your proposed six-week cadence).

## Proposed New Ladder



| Tier | Length | Ratio vs previous | Primary Use | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Atom** | **30 min** | base | Tactical task block | 
| **Session** | **2 h** | ×4 | Deep-work chunk / meeting max | 
| **Day** | 24 h | ×12 | Daily review & planning | 
| **Week** | 7 d | ≈×7 | Tactical sync, habit audit | 
| **Sprint** | **14 d** | ×2 | Agile iterations / small projects | 
| **Cycle** | **6 w (42 d)** | ×3 | Your full execution block, aligns with "6 + 1" model | 
| **Quarter** | 13 w | ×~2 | OKRs, finance, product checkpoints | 
| **Year** | 52 w | ×4 | Strategic reset, tax, narrative | 
| **Tri-Year** | **3 y** | ×3 | Product lifecycles, mid-term bets | 
| **Decade** | 10 y | ×≈3.3 | Major capital, career arcs | 
| **Generation** | **30 y** | ×3 | Family, dynasty, institutional horizons | 
| **Century** | 100 y | ×3.3 | Civilisational vision | 

### Why This Works

- **Consistent ×2--×4 jumps** -- easy mental scaling; no abrupt leaps.
- **Cycle (6 w)** slots perfectly between month and quarter--gives you an execution container without abandoning calendar quarters.
- **Sprint (2 w)** accommodates agile or experimental work, mapping to industry practice.
- **Tri-Year** replaces arbitrary 5 y; three years matches most tech/product replacement cycles and VC fund milestones.
- **Generation (30 y)** fills the strategic void between decade and half-century--vital for dynastic planning.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Keep month only for administrative reporting.** Operational cadence should default to sprint-cycle-quarter; month can be a passive checkpoint, not a planning anchor.

2. **Lock reviews to each tier.**

    - Daily micro-review (already in place).

    - Weekly tactical reset (you run this Sunday).

    - Sprint retrospective (lightweight).

    - Cycle deep review + decompression (Week 7).

    - Quarterly strategic board (internal).

    - Yearly reset retreat.

    - Tri-Year summit (vision realignment).

3. **Tooling** -- Use ISO week numbering for anything ≥ week; avoid month-name drift.

4. **Visualization** -- A single cascading Gantt or concentric ring diagram keeps all horizons visible at once.
