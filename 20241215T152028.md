# Work, Culture, Self

– Work is generally speaking everything physical, culture is development of the cultured spirit and self is to-be seen as mental training
– Through the day, generally everything is work, this is the base profile. I have to insert actions that develop culture. Sprinkled or rather simultaneous are actions of the self.
– Essentially, everything is work. But because I have to be more than that, develop different perspectives and knowledge I also have to insert cultured actions in there.
– During the entire day there is the self layer which is the internal, mental one
– Work kann monotones produktives erreichen sein, während culture der besondere Funken ist. Eben Zimmer schön dekorieren, science fiction lesen, leben nicht nur auf Sparflamme leben. Extra, außerhalb des alltägliche repetitiven.
