Your query could be more precisely articulated as follows: *"Could you provide a detailed guide on the different types of shirts, how to style them, and whether to pair them with undershirts or tank tops for various occasions?"*

Certainly! The collared shirt is a versatile staple that can be styled in multiple ways depending on the occasion, weather, and desired level of formality. Here’s a comprehensive guide to choosing, wearing, and pairing shirts, including the use of undershirts and styling tips.

### 1. **Types Of Collared Shirts**

	Understanding the various types of shirts helps you select the right style for each situation. Here are the primary types:

	- **Oxford Cloth Button-Down (OCBD)**:  
	  - **Fabric & Fit**: Made from heavier Oxford cloth, these shirts have a slightly textured finish and a more relaxed structure. The button-down collar helps the shirt maintain its shape.
	  - **Styling**: OCBDs can be worn both tucked and untucked. They pair well with chinos, dark jeans, and even under blazers for a more relaxed formal look.
	  - **Occasions**: Ideal for smart-casual settings and suitable for everyday university wear. They can also be dressed up slightly with a blazer or down with rolled-up sleeves.
	
	- **Dress Shirt**:  
	  - **Fabric & Fit**: Typically made from smoother cotton and featuring a more structured, non-button-down collar. Dress shirts often come with French cuffs, which are designed for cufflinks.
	  - **Styling**: Best worn tucked into tailored trousers or with a suit. They can be layered under a sweater or with a blazer for formal or semi-formal occasions.
	  - **Occasions**: More formal settings, such as presentations, interviews, or events where a polished appearance is required.

	- **Casual Cotton or Linen Shirt**:  
	  - **Fabric & Fit**: Lighter weight, often with a softer structure. Linen shirts are particularly breathable, making them ideal for summer.
	  - **Styling**: These can be worn untucked with rolled sleeves and paired with chinos or shorts in summer. Cotton shirts with a slightly relaxed fit can be layered under sweaters or worn over a T-shirt for a more casual look.
	  - **Occasions**: Perfect for warm weather, casual outings, or when you want a laid-back yet refined style.

	- **Flannel Shirt**:  
	  - **Fabric & Fit**: Made from soft, brushed cotton, providing warmth and a cozy feel.
	  - **Styling**: Can be worn tucked into wool trousers for a smart-casual look or untucked over a T-shirt for a more relaxed style. It also pairs well with denim for a classic, slightly rugged appearance.
	  - **Occasions**: Best for cooler months and casual settings where you want a comfortable yet put-together look.

### 2. **Guidelines For Wearing Shirts**

	- **Tucking vs. Untucking**:  
	  - Generally, dress shirts and those with a longer hem should be tucked in to maintain a neat silhouette, especially when wearing with tailored trousers or a blazer.
	  - OCBDs and more casual shirts with a shorter hem can be worn untucked, especially with chinos or jeans, creating a more relaxed style.
	  - As a rule of thumb, if the hem extends well past your hips, it’s best tucked in.

	- **Buttoning Up**:  
	  - For a more formal appearance, button the shirt all the way up, especially if wearing a tie or under a blazer.
	  - For smart-casual settings, leaving the top button undone creates a relaxed but still polished look.
	  - Avoid leaving more than two buttons undone, as this can look too informal or unkempt.

	- **Rolling Sleeves**:  
	  - Rolling up your sleeves is a great way to add a casual touch to an otherwise polished look. Aim for a clean, even roll, ideally folding the cuff up twice for a balanced appearance.
	  - This style is particularly useful during warmer days or when transitioning from a formal to a more relaxed setting.

### 3. **Undershirts: To Wear or Not to Wear?**

	The choice to wear an undershirt depends on comfort, weather, and how the shirt will be worn. Here’s a guide to using undershirts effectively:

	- **Benefits of Wearing an Undershirt**:  
	  - **Absorbs Sweat**: An undershirt helps absorb sweat, keeping your dress shirt dry and clean for longer. It’s particularly useful for warmer days or if you’re prone to perspiration.
	  - **Adds Warmth**: A well-fitted undershirt provides an extra layer of warmth during colder months without adding bulk.
	  - **Improves Opacity**: For lighter-colored shirts, an undershirt can help prevent the fabric from appearing see-through.

	- **Types of Undershirts**:
	  - **Crew Neck Undershirt**: Best worn with dress shirts when the top button is fastened or when wearing a tie, as the neckline will be hidden.
	  - **V-Neck Undershirt**: A better choice when you plan to leave the top button or two of your shirt undone, as it remains hidden under the open collar.
	  - **Tank Tops**: These provide less coverage and aren’t as effective for sweat absorption but can offer a minimal layer for very hot days. However, they might not be ideal for wearing under dress shirts, as they do not cover the underarm area.

	- **Undershirt Fit**:  
	  - Choose a well-fitted undershirt that hugs the body without being too tight. It should fit closer to the skin than your outer shirt to avoid creating visible lines or extra bulk.
	  - Neutral colors like white, grey, or beige work best, as they are less likely to show through lighter shirts.

### 4. **Styling Suggestions for Different Settings**

	- **For University Classes**:
	  - **Option 1**: Light blue OCBD with navy chinos, white crew neck undershirt, brown leather loafers, and a navy cardigan for cooler days.
	  - **Option 2**: Casual cotton button-down shirt (light grey or muted stripe) worn untucked with dark denim and a minimalist V-neck undershirt. Pair with white leather sneakers.
	  - **Option 3**: Flannel shirt in a neutral plaid, worn over a plain white T-shirt or tank top, and paired with wool trousers for a relaxed yet polished look.

	- **For Presentations or Formal Events**:
	  - **Option 1**: White dress shirt with a subtle texture, tucked into tailored grey trousers, paired with a lightweight blazer. Add a crew neck undershirt for a smooth look.
	  - **Option 2**: Pale blue dress shirt with a slightly structured collar, paired with a charcoal wool blazer and matching trousers, a simple V-neck undershirt, and black leather Oxfords.

	- **For Warmer Weather**:
	  - **Option 1**: Linen or light cotton button-down, worn untucked with chinos. A V-neck undershirt or no undershirt is ideal to keep cool while maintaining a crisp appearance.
	  - **Option 2**: OCBD with sleeves rolled up, paired with tailored shorts or chinos, and loafers without socks (or with no-show socks).

### 5. **Shirt Care Tips**

	- **Ironing or Steaming**: Keep shirts wrinkle-free for a sharp look. Investing in a steamer can make this process quicker and gentler on fabrics.
	- **Proper Washing**: Use cold water to prevent shrinkage and maintain the integrity of the fabric. For delicate materials like linen, wash on a gentle cycle or hand-wash.
	- **Storing Shirts**: Hang dress shirts on wooden hangers to maintain their shape. For more casual shirts, folding neatly is acceptable but avoid overstuffing drawers to prevent creases.

### Conclusion

Wearing a collared shirt every day can be both practical and stylish when you understand the nuances of each type and how to pair them with undershirts. By using this guide, you can adapt your shirts to various settings—keeping cool in summer, staying comfortable in winter, and always maintaining a refined and polished appearance. With a thoughtful approach to styling and care, the collared shirt becomes a versatile backbone of your daily wardrobe.
