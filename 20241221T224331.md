Integrating the idea of assigning yourself an **hourly rate** for evaluating tasks into your **Dynamic Pressure System** can help prioritize high-value activities and ensure you're using your time efficiently. Here's how this concept can fit into your approach:

---

### **Framing The Hourly Rate Concept in Your System**

#### **1. Define Your Effective Hourly Rate (EHR)**

The **Effective Hourly Rate (EHR)** is the baseline value of your time. It represents the minimum hourly income you should generate for your time to be spent effectively. This rate can be tied to your **Hourly Income Requirement (HIR)** to align it with your overall financial system.

- **EHR Formula**:
  - `EHR (€) = HIR (€) + Target Surplus (€)`

#### **Example**

- HIR: €1.50/hour.
- Surplus Goal: €0.50/hour (to account for long-term growth and reward fund expansion).
- EHR: €2.00/hour.

---

#### **2. Categorize Tasks Based on EHR**

Use your EHR to decide which tasks to handle yourself and which to delegate or outsource. Divide tasks into three categories:

1. **High-Value Tasks**:
	- Tasks with potential earnings above your EHR (e.g., freelancing, business development, learning income-generating skills).
	- Prioritize these tasks as they maximize your earning capacity.

2. **Low-Value Tasks**:
	- Tasks with an "opportunity cost" (e.g., house cleaning, grocery shopping) that fall below your EHR.
	- Delegate or outsource these tasks to free up time for high-value activities.

3. **No-Value Tasks**:
	- Tasks that are neither necessary nor contribute to income or goals (e.g., excessive social media use).
	- Eliminate these tasks entirely.

---

#### **3. Build Delegation Into Your Financial System**

To make delegation practical and sustainable, allocate a portion of your income for outsourcing:

- **Delegation Budget**:
  - Allocate **5–10% of your monthly income** to pay for tasks that fall below your EHR.
  - Example:
	 - Monthly income: €2,000.
	 - Delegation budget: €200.

---

#### **4. Dynamic Adjustment of EHR**

As your **HIR** increases over time, your **EHR** should also increase to reflect your growing earning capacity. This ensures you're consistently focusing on tasks that align with your highest potential value.

- **Formula for Adjusted EHR**:
  - `Adjusted EHR (€) = Current HIR (€) × Multiplier (e.g., 1.5–2)`
  - Example:
	 - Current HIR: €2/hour.
	 - Multiplier: 1.5.
	 - Adjusted EHR: €3/hour.

### **Integrating EHR With the Dynamic Pressure System**

#### **1. Add EHR to the Daily Log**

Expand your **Daily Log Table** in Notion to include:
- **EHR (€)**: Your calculated effective hourly rate.
- **Time Allocation (Hours)**: The number of hours spent on specific tasks.
- **Task Value (€)**: The value of the task relative to your EHR (e.g., below, at, or above).

**Columns to Add**:  
| **Column**            | **Type**  | **Description**                                                  |
|------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **EHR (€)**           | Formula   | Dynamic hourly rate based on HIR and surplus goals.             |
| **Time Spent (Hrs)**  | Number    | Hours spent on a specific task.                                 |
| **Task Value (€)**    | Formula   | `EHR × Time Spent (Hrs)` to evaluate the task's value.          |
| **Outsource?**        | Checkbox  | Mark tasks that can be delegated or outsourced.                 |

---

#### **2. Evaluate Tasks Weekly**

Use your **Daily Log** to review how you’re spending your time and determine if tasks align with your EHR:

1. Calculate the **Value of Tasks**:
	- Multiply time spent on each task by your EHR.
	- Example:
	  - Cleaning: 2 hours.
	  - EHR: €3/hour.
	  - Task Value: €6.

2. Compare Task Value to Outsourcing Costs:
	- If outsourcing the task costs less than the task value, delegate it.
	- Example:
	  - Outsourcing cleaning costs €5/hour.
	  - Task Value: €6 → **Outsource cleaning**.

3. Eliminate or Minimize Low-Value Tasks:
	- Reduce or eliminate tasks consistently falling below your EHR.

---

#### **3. Include Outsourcing Costs in Living Costs**

Track delegation expenses as part of your **Living Costs Tracker** in Notion:

| **Category**        | **Monthly Cost (€)** | **Daily Share (€)** | **Notes**                       |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| House Cleaning      | €100                | €3.33               | Outsourced 4 hours/month.      |
| Grocery Delivery    | €50                 | €1.67               | Replaced weekly grocery trips. |
| Administrative Help | €50                 | €1.67               | Delegated repetitive tasks.    |

### **Benefits Of This Approach**

1. **Maximizes Earning Potential**:
	- Ensures your time is spent on tasks that align with or exceed your EHR.

2. **Frees Up Time for High-Value Work**:
	- Delegating low-value tasks gives you more time to focus on growth.

3. **Systematic Delegation**:
	- Prevents guilt over outsourcing by tying decisions to clear financial metrics.

4. **Dynamic Scaling**:
	- As your HIR increases, so does your ability to delegate, automate, and eliminate tasks.
