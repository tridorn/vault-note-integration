# Directive of 2025-04-09

## Pre-Execution

### Today's Intent
<!-- What broader chief aim do you want to focus on today? -->
- Gain clarity on path forward

### Primary Objectives
<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- Finish The Lean Startup
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- Fill timeframes up to current year
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
- Finish HTML & CSS courses on Codecademy

### Process Intentions
<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1: Need to start with this and breeze through it. It's more work than I'm anticipating and I need to create space for the other tasks. Best if I finish it while still at Uni
- Task 2: Do this after finishing The Lean Startup
- Task 3: Best done at home

### Efficiency Killers to Mitigate
<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->
- Getting side-tracked by minor work or the work not planned
-

## Execution

### Bottleneck Log
<!-- What slowed execution today? E.g., distractions, over-perfection, slow decision-making, unexpected blockers. -->
- 

### Real-Time Course Corrections
<!-- What tweaks were made mid-day to maintain efficiency? Only note direct changes to process. -->
-

## Post-Execution

### Deviation Analysis
<!-- Did execution match expectation? If not, what caused deviation? -->
- [ ] Task 1:
- [ ] Task 2:  
- [ ] Task 3:  

### Optimisation Opportunity
<!-- What execution inefficiency should be addressed tomorrow? Focus on a single high-leverage improvement. -->
- 

### Tomorrow’s Process Experiment
<!-- What **one small tweak** will be tested tomorrow to refine execution? Keep it experimental and specific. -->
