**HOUSE EUPATOR**  
**CHARTER OF OFFICE AND RANK**  
*Vol. I – Authority, Hierarchy, and the Right to Command*

---

## **Preamble**

Power must be structured to endure.  
Rank is not vanity—it is **encoded trust**.  
This Charter codifies the offices of the House and the conditions under which they may be granted, revoked, or transformed.

Every role exists to serve the **continuity of will**, the **projection of force**, and the **preservation of doctrine**.  
No title is eternal. Only the Codex is.

---

## **I. Foundational Principle: Rank Is Function**

- Rank is **not social status**. It is a **functional authority** within a sovereign command architecture.  
- All ranks serve either:  
  1. **Doctrine** (interpretation, memory, law)  
  2. **Command** (strategy, deployment, judgment)  
  3. **Execution** (mission, stewardship, expansion)

Each office exists to carry a piece of the House’s body—*mind, will, or hand.*

---

## **II. Supreme Rank: The Primarch**

> *“The one who gives shape to continuity.”*

- **Nature**: Singular and sovereign  
- **Powers**:  
  - Interpret and amend the Codex  
  - Appoint and remove Praetorians  
  - Declare or seal Succession  
  - Override any decision at any tier  
  - Authorize existential acts (shutdown, exile, resurrection)

- **Presence**: May be **present, dormant, or absent**. The House must persist in all three states.

- **Succession**: Must be encoded into the **Succession Vault** and ratified by at least two Praetorians. In the absence of a designation, the Core may vote a successor via unanimous rite.

---

The House remembers everything. And forgets only by fire.
