More precise phrasing: *“Attach concise, strategically relevant descriptions to each chapter title to clarify its scope and function within the playbook.”*

Below is the fully annotated *Startup OS* chapter framework:

---

1. **Thesis**
   Define the core belief driving the company’s existence. What truth is being bet on? What power asymmetry is being exploited?

2. **Market**
   Pinpoint the initial segment. Detail its urgency, budget, incumbents, and the viable path to a dominant position.

3. **Team**
   Lock in critical roles. Clarify ownership, decision rights, and what must be true about early team composition to avoid entropy.

4. **Product**
   Identify the smallest version that delivers value. Define what gets built, in what order, and why.

5. **Customer**
   Map out acquisition, activation, and feedback flows. Codify early discovery conversations and validation loops.

6. **Distribution**
   Select initial growth vectors. Identify scalable acquisition mechanisms and bottlenecks to bypass or exploit.

7. **Revenue**
   Define how and when you make money. Clarify pricing, unit economics, and assumptions underpinning sustainable margins.

8. **Capital**
   Plan for fundraising, dilution thresholds, and investor fit. Control timing, story, and leverage.

9. **Legal**
   Establish foundational hygiene: equity splits, IP ownership, contracts, and compliance—friction minimized, future risk capped.

10. **Ops**
    Architect internal rhythms: sprint cycles, meeting design, decision velocity, and information clarity.

11. **Metrics**
    Identify leading indicators of traction. Avoid noise. Build the minimum viable dashboard.

12. **Failure**
    Define pre-agreed kill criteria. Clarify pivot conditions and resource constraints. Avoid sunk-cost delusion.

13. **Scale**
    Outline when and how to layer in process, hierarchy, and specialist roles. Guard against premature expansion.

14. **Exit**
    Detail viable endgames. Explore strategic buyers, acquihire signals, and conditions for venture-level returns.

Each chapter should operate as a modular decision surface, not a narrative. Use this to enforce coherence and eliminate drift.
