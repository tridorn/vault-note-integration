You should have phrased that as: "Is it operationally sound to run the rails stack on my primary workstation, given limited uptime and single-user conditions?"

* * *

If it's truly only you in the early stage, running the stack on your main desktop is possible, but you must treat it as an unstable, transient node and build around that reality.

The constraint isn't performance, it's availability and recoverability.

  

### 1. What works in your favour

- Single user means there are no collaborators waiting on uptime.
- No customers yet means outages are merely inconvenient, not revenue-impacting.
- Physical access gives you total control and zero third-party trust at this stage.

  

### 2. The liabilities

- Short uptime window means any automation relying on "always-on" will be brittle (e.g., CI triggers, scheduled backups, webhooks).
- Dual-use machine increases risk of config drift, resource starvation, and security bleed between work and server processes.
- Physical dependency: you can't work remotely without turning on your desktop.

  

### 3. Rational approach if you go ahead

  

Treat the desktop as a development and staging node, not as the authoritative store.

The authoritative copy of all critical state (Git repos, object storage, DB dumps) must live off the desktop in a provider you can rebuild from instantly.

  

Minimum mitigation stack:

1. Containerise everything (Docker Compose or Podman) so the environment is reproducible elsewhere in minutes.

2. Off-site backups every session:

    - Git mirror push to a private remote (GitHub, GitLab, or self-hosted VM in cloud).

    - MinIO bucket sync to S3-compatible provider (Wasabi, Backblaze B2, etc.).

    - Postgres dump to object storage on shutdown.

3. Bootstrap script in infra-bootstrap that can stand up the same stack on a cloud VM in under one hour.

4. Local-only services: anything non-critical can stay desktop-bound (internal dashboards, scratch services).

5. Public-facing endpoints: only if you have a static IP and firewall properly. Otherwise, use tunnelling (Tailscale Funnel, Cloudflare Tunnel) for ad-hoc exposure.

  

### 4. When to switch off-desktop

  

You move to a persistent host the moment:

- Another person depends on the rails daily.
- Automation needs to run when you're offline.
- You need inbound services reachable at predictable times.

  

At that point, you can lift-and-shift your Compose setup to a single cheap cloud VM without architectural change.

  

### 5. Reality check

  

Running on your desktop is fine for first code and first rails if you build with the assumption that the node will disappear at any moment.

Think ephemeral server discipline:

- Always reproducible.
- No irreplaceable data local-only.
- No reliance on 24/7 uptime.

If you want, I can give you a desktop-mode bootstrap profile: one Compose stack with an exit hook that pushes all critical data to off-site before shutdown, so you can turn the machine off and sleep without losing state. That would make the desktop viable until you bring in a real server.
