You should have asked: _"What is the complete structural hierarchy from Mission to Project, Program, Campaign, and beyond, and how do these units logically relate in terms of scope, duration, ownership, and authority?"_

Below is the full, rational tree.

* * *

## I. Tree Overview (From Tactical to Strategic)
    
    
    Cell        ← execution pod (no mandate)
    └─ Mission      ← scoped objective, short-term, cross-functional
       └─ Project       ← bounded problem, persistent artefact or deliverable
          └─ Program        ← thematic coordination of projects
             └─ Campaign        ← strategic ambition over time
                └─ Portfolio        ← fiscal year view; manages multiple campaigns
    

This is a **strict hierarchy**, not a network. Each layer exists to rationalise complexity one layer below it.

* * *

## II. Full Breakdown by Unit

### 1. **Cell**

- **Function**: Tactical grouping of workers within a Mission
- **Ownership**: Mission Commander
- **Scope**: Discipline-based or task-based
- **Duration**: Sprint-level or shorter
- **Persistence**: None
- **Authority**: None

> Exists only to distribute and focus execution.

* * *

### 2. **Mission**

- **Function**: Unit of execution with a clear, scoped outcome
- **Ownership**: Mission Commander
- **Accountability**: Field Officer oversight; execution result-bearing
- **Scope**: One objective, one team, one timebox (typically 1--3 months)
- **Lifecycle**: Charter → Execute via Sprints → Debrief → Terminate or Roll Forward
- **Structure**: Branch in project repo, logged in Sprint board, assigned FO

> Missions get things done.

* * *

### 3. **Project**

- **Function**: Container of Missions that jointly advance a coherent deliverable
- **Ownership**: Varies; usually Program lead or PM
- **Scope**: Single product, client workstream, or functional problem
- **Duration**: 3--12 months; may outlive constituent Missions
- **Persistence**: Persists beyond execution; holds master content, assets, outputs
- **Structure**: Folder in `projects/` repo; may have sub-repos if isolated (e.g. NDA)

> Projects organise efforts around a shared output or client-facing construct.

* * *

### 4. **Program**

- **Function**: Thematic grouping of Projects under a strategic focus area
- **Ownership**: Program Owner (appointed by Strategic Ops)
- **Scope**: One theme, multiple deliverables, often cross-functional
- **Duration**: 6--18 months
- **Persistence**: Exists until the theme is decommissioned
- **Structure**: Folder inside Campaign repo (`Program-PRG_GreenFinance/`)

> Programs reduce entropy by aggregating related Projects for focus and leverage.

* * *

### 5. **Campaign**

- **Function**: Strategic execution plan across Programs to achieve a goal
- **Ownership**: Strategic Ops, under Strategic Council mandate
- **Scope**: High-level ambition (e.g. "Dominate EU Market", "Replatform Stack")
- **Duration**: 9--24 months
- **Persistence**: Tracked and archived for historical record; evaluated at end
- **Structure**: Standalone GitHub repo (`CAMP_2025_DominateEU`)

> Campaigns operationalise strategy over time and across scope.

* * *

### 6. **Portfolio**

- **Function**: Meta-container of all Campaigns started in a fiscal year
- **Ownership**: Finance + Strategy (Council)
- **Scope**: Everything the organisation attempts within the year
- **Duration**: 1 fiscal year
- **Persistence**: Snapshotted annually
- **Structure**: GitHub team or GitHub org tag

> Portfolios provide the top-level fiscal and strategic framing.

## III. Structural Inheritance Summary

| Unit | Outputs Work? | Has Charter? | Execution Mode | Exists in Git | Has FO? | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Cell | Yes | No | Sprint-based | No | No | 
| Mission | Yes | Yes | Sprint-based | Branch | Yes | 
| Project | Aggregates | Yes | Mission-based | Folder or repo | No | 
| Program | Organises | Yes | Project-based | Folder | No | 
| Campaign | Coordinates | Yes | Program-based | Repo | No | 
| Portfolio | Frames | Implicit | Campaign-based | Org-level | No | 

* * *

## IV. Why This Structure Is Rational

- Each unit has **a distinct time scale, output type, and level of abstraction**.
- Work is **always done in Missions**, not Projects or Programs.
- Cells exist **only to reduce intra-Mission friction**, not to carry weight.
- Projects and above serve **coordination and coherence**, not execution.

## V. Visual (simplified)
    
    
    Portfolio-2025
    └─ Campaign: Dominate Europe
       ├─ Program: Enter Germany
       │   ├─ Project: BOSCH Onboarding
       │   │   ├─ Mission: M014-Kestrel
       │   │   └─ Mission: M019-Gorgon
       │   └─ Project: Finance API
       └─ Program: Enter France
           └─ Project: French Docs

## Conclusion

- **Missions** are the operational unit of execution.
- **Cells** are tactical scaffolding inside Missions.
- **Projects** collect the work of Missions into a coherent product.
- **Programs** group Projects thematically.
- **Campaigns** push Programs toward strategic goals.
- **Portfolios** organise Campaigns fiscally and longitudinally.

Structure is not ornament.  
Each layer exists to reduce uncertainty, absorb coordination cost, and preserve focus.
