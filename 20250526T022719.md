A more structured version of your request:
*“Design a dynamic system that builds on the static 12-cluster taxonomy to enable practical toolsets for distinct organisational needs—such as startup execution playbooks—by layering context, sequencing, and activation logic.”*

### System Proposal: **TAXON → OPSYS**

You retain **TAXON** (your 12-cluster model) as the **foundational ontology**, but build a modular operational layer above it: **OPSYS**, a context-aware execution layer that makes the taxonomy usable.

---

## **Structure of the System**

### 1. **TAXON (The Static Layer)**

* 12 clusters define the **full terrain** of organisational concerns.
* Treated as a **universal map**, not a process.

### 2. **OPSYS (The Dynamic Layer)**

A flexible, tool-generating framework with four core components:

#### A. **Context Profiles**

Define the *type* of organisation or scenario:

* **Startup – Pre-PMF**
* **Startup – Scaling**
* **SME – Operational Efficiency**
* **Corporate – Innovation Unit**
* **Nonprofit – Growth Stage**
  Each profile sets **relevance weights** across the 12 clusters.

#### B. **Activation Maps**

Define which clusters are:

* **Active** (must be explicitly operationalised)
* **Scaffolded** (minimally structured but monitored)
* **Latent** (ignored for now)
  E.g. Pre-PMF startup → *Customer*, *Offering*, *Strategy*, *Capital* are Active.

#### C. **Module Library (Tools & Frameworks)**

Each cluster has modular toolkits attachable on demand:

* **Strategy Cluster → Market Map, Positioning Canvas, Scenario Tree**
* **Customer Cluster → JTBD Template, Persona Grid, Retention Funnel Audit**
* **Financial Cluster → Burn Model, Revenue Architecture, Scenario Cashflow Sheet**
  The tools are **slot-ins**, not doctrine—they instantiate the cluster as needed.

#### D. **Temporal Programs**

Predefined sequences that operationalise clusters over time:

* **Startup Boot Sequence**: Thesis → Market → Product → Customer → Capital
* **Growth Hygiene Program**: Financial → Ops → People → Infrastructure
* Each is a time-boxed rollout of toolsets across clusters based on milestones.

## **How It Works In Practice**

**Step 1: Set Profile**

> “We’re a B2B SaaS startup, Seed round, pre-PMF.”
> → OPSYS activates a startup profile.

**Step 2: View Activation Map**
→ Active: Strategy, Offering, Customer, Capital
→ Scaffolded: People, Ops, Financial
→ Latent: Knowledge, Infrastructure, Environment, Adaptation

**Step 3: Deploy Toolsets**
→ Pull in “Customer Interview Sprint” module, “Wedge Thesis Builder”, “Revenue Mechanics Canvas” from relevant clusters.

**Step 4: Sequence with Program**
→ Run the “Startup Boot Sequence” over 10 weeks.

---

## **Benefits**

* **Precision**: Only engage what’s relevant to stage and archetype.
* **Scalability**: Same TAXON, different OPSYS overlays for different use cases.
* **Coherence**: All tools are conceptually tied back to a shared structure.
* **Composability**: You can plug in other frameworks without schema drift.

## Summary Model

| Layer      | Name               | Function                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Static     | **TAXON**          | Defines total organisational terrain (12 clusters) |
| Contextual | **Profile**        | Determines what’s relevant (startup, SME, etc.)    |
| Dynamic    | **Activation Map** | Sets which clusters are active/scaffolded/latent   |
| Modular    | **Toolsets**       | Cluster-linked tools, models, templates            |
| Temporal   | **Programs**       | Phase-specific sequences of activation             |

This structure turns your taxonomy from a reference map into an **adaptive operating system**. Static → contextual → modular → sequenced. That’s the execution gradient.
