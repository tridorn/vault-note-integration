Alright -- here's your First 90 Days Dubai Networking Map.

The goal: in three months, you go from "new arrival" to recognizable operator in multiple circles, so people start introducing you rather than you having to cold approach.

  

I'm giving you five channels, each chosen for your context (young, ambitious, building a business engine, already with German base).

* * *

## Channel 1 -- The "Core Power" Hub

  

Capital Club (DIFC)

- Private members club in the Dubai International Financial Centre.
- This is where you'll meet:

    - Fund managers.

    - Senior partners of law firms.

    - Government project consultants.
- Why it matters for you: This is the fast lane to credibility with investors and decision-makers.
- How to work it:

    - Apply for membership early (show your GmbH/Dubai company background).

    - Attend business breakfasts and speaker events -- the informal networking is where deals start.
- Target: 1--2 meetings a week here, every week.
* * *

## Channel 2 -- Government & Policy Access

  

Dubai Chamber of Commerce & Dubai Future Foundation

- Dubai Chamber gives you visibility in official trade and investment circles.
- Dubai Future Foundation hosts innovation & future economy events -- their guest list is a mix of ministers, startup founders, and global corporates.
- Why it matters for you: It's the quickest way to get on the radar of people who can open doors to government-backed projects.
- How to work it:

    - Register your company with the Chamber as soon as possible.

    - Volunteer to speak on a panel or lead a workshop in your sector -- positioning you as an imported expert.
- Target: Attend 1 Chamber event + 1 Future Foundation talk/month.
* * *

## Channel 3 -- The "Unusual Access" Route

  

Dubai Business Women Council (DBWC)

- Mixed access events but female-led leadership.
- Lower male presence = higher personal visibility.
- Why it matters for you:

    - Access to family office circles that don't show up at big expos.

    - Potential warm intros to top-tier Emiratis via personal networks.
- How to work it:

    - Attend with the mindset of collaboration, not sales.

    - Ask about how your "company engine" could support female founders -- it creates instant goodwill.
- Target: 1 event every 6 weeks -- not a constant presence, just enough to be known.
* * *

## Channel 4 -- The Big-Stage Platform

  

GITEX (October) & STEP Conference (February)

- GITEX: One of the world's largest tech expos.
- STEP: Regional startup festival, strong VC attendance.
- Why it matters for you:

    - These are the international visibility moments.

    - You can collect more quality contacts in 3 days here than in 3 months of random meetups.
- How to work it:

    - Don't just attend -- try to get on a side panel or host a micro-meetup during the event.

    - Follow up with every contact within 24--48h -- Dubai networking dies quickly if you don't move fast.
- Target: 2--3 big events in first 90 days (or shift if timing doesn't match).
* * *

## Channel 5 -- Private Social Capital

  

Industry-Specific Dinners & Invite-Only Groups

- Examples: "Tech Talks DXB" private dinners, small founder masterminds, sector dinners at Zuma or Gaia.
- Why it matters for you: Deals in Dubai often start in private rooms, not public expos.
- How to work it:

    - Use intros from Channels 1--3 to get invited.

    - Be the person who connects others, not the one constantly pitching.
- Target: One such private gathering per month.
* * *

## Your 90-Day Networking Pattern

- Every week:

    - 1 Capital Club meeting.

    - 1--2 coffee meetings from new contacts.
- Every month:

    - 1 Chamber/Future Foundation event.

    - 1 private dinner or invite-only gathering.
- Every 6 weeks:

    - 1 DBWC event.
- Every major expo cycle:

    - Attend and leverage international events for max visibility.
* * *

### Why This Works for You

- Covers formal, semi-formal, and private networking.
- Builds parallel reputations -- investor crowd knows you, government circle knows you, private connectors know you.
- Gives you leverage when you later approach U.S. investors -- "active Dubai operator with local traction" plays well in pitch decks.

If you want, I can now merge this with a day-by-day tactical checklist for your first 90 days in Dubai -- literally what to do, where to go, who to contact, in sequence -- so your landing is executed like a campaign, not just a move.
