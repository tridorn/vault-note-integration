### Near-Term Playbook — *Three-Year Holding Pattern under German Tax Residency*  

You are **anchored in Germany** until roughly Q2 2028. That single fact dictates everything that is realistically executable now:

| Design choice | Why it matters *today* | Reversibility after you expatriate |
|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Keep all legal seats inside Germany** (for now) | Foreign entities you “manage” from Germany become *effectively* German and you pay German Körperschaft- & Gewerbesteuer **anyway**—plus you trigger CFC reporting headaches. | A German company can be **migrated** or merged outbound under the EU-Mobility Directive once you move. citeturn3view0turn4view0 |
| **Minimise latent exit tax** | The moment you leave Germany, shareholdings ≥ 1 % are deemed sold at fair value (§ 6 AStG). From 2022 the perpetual EU/EWR deferral was killed; only a 7-year instalment plan remains, usually with security demanded. citeturn2search0turn2search1 | You can pay in seven yearly tranches or crystallise the gain early while valuations are low. |
| **Do not push IP value into Germany** | IP relocations later face transfer-pricing exit charges and 19 % VAT quirks. | Develop core code under *personal* copyright and license it to the GmbH on arm’s-length terms; the licence can later be reassigned abroad at residual value. |
| **Avoid U.S. LLC “quick fixes”** | Post-CTA every Delaware/Wyoming LLC must disclose its beneficial owner to FinCEN; Berlin tax office will obtain that data by exchange. citeturn7search0 | If you really need a U.S. wrapper later, form a C-Corp when you are non-resident. |

## 1 Minimalist German Structure (now – 2028)

| Layer | Concrete action | Capital outlay | Why this, not something fancier? |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Operating shell** | Form a **UG (haftungsbeschränkt)** (EUR 1–5 k capital) in a low-trade-tax municipality (e.g. Grünwald 12.1 %, Gruibingen 10.6 %). Convert to GmbH once profitable. | €1 k + notary & register fees ≈ €1.5 k | Limited liability, quick setup, and *book value* of your shares starts at ~€1 k—useful for low exit tax. |
| **Holding layer** | Optional: second UG as 100 % parent ➔ “Holding-UG”. | extra €1 k | Lets you migrate the *parent* abroad later via cross-border conversion, while the German OpCo remains for EU staff. |
| **IP & brand** | Keep copyright to yourself and **license** it to OpCo (royalty ≤ 6 % revenue; confirm with TP study). | Legal drafting ≈ €2 k | Royalty flow is deductible now, and the licensor (you) can later assign the licence into a UAE company with modest valuation. |
| **Banking & payments** | Open business accounts at Solaris-based fintechs (Penta, Qonto) + Wise for FX. | 0–€30/month | KYC passes fast; later you can add Swiss/Liechtenstein private banking once assets accumulate. |
| **Record-keeping** | Cloud bookkeeping (lexoffice/Dext), separate IP ledger, monthly valuations of your shares/IP. | €20–50/month | Creates audit trail for future exit-tax valuation negotiations. |

### Why **not** Estonia, Delaware, or Dubai right now?
Because management and “mind-and-management” would still be on German soil ➔ you get double compliance with zero tax benefit and possible *Steuerhinterziehung* exposure.

## 2 Governance to Keep Future Options Open  

1. **Articles of Association**  
   *Add a “future cross-border conversion” clause* authorising the shareholders’ meeting to transfer the seat to any EEA state with 75 % approval. This accelerates the Umwandlungsrecht procedure later.  
2. **Share-class engineering**  
   - Issue **20 % non-voting founder shares** to yourself now and **80 % blank (“Authorised Capital § 55 AktG-style”)**.  
   - When exit is near, you can issue those blank shares to a new UAE holding at *nominal* value before the German company’s valuation spikes.  
   - German tax office will attack if obvious undervaluation, so execute when EBITDA is still thin.  
3. **IP licence with step-down option**  
   - Insert a clause letting either party *renegotiate or novate* the licence if you cease German residency.  
   - Keeps the tax authority from arguing that the move itself adds value that should have been taxed in Germany.  
4. **Board composition**  
   - Appoint one **non-resident director** (e.g., in Austria or NL) now; hold board meetings virtually but record them as if chaired abroad once per quarter. This evidences some cross-border nexus, useful when you start outbound planning.

## 3 Pre-Exit Trigger Points (monitor quarterly)

| Metric | Threshold | Immediate action |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| **Annual revenue** | €1 m | Engage tax adviser to *pre-value* shares; decide whether to pay small exit tax now vs. later. |
| **Cash retained** | €250 k | Open Swiss/Liechtenstein custody; keep ≤ 25 % cash in Germany. |
| **EBITDA margin** | ≥ 25 % | Start drafting cross-border conversion plan; higher margins inflate exit tax base. |
| **Staff headcount** | ≥ 10 FTE | Consider spin-off: keep German workforce in OpCo, move IP/clients to upcoming UAE entity post-move. |

## 4 Your “No-Regret” Checklist (do this within 60 days)

1. **Found UG at low-trade-tax location**, adopt flexible statutes.  
2. **File EU trademark** for your brand *personally* (≈ €1 k) and license it to UG.  
3. **Draft licence & shareholder agreements** with future move clauses.  
4. **Set up fintech banking + professional bookkeeping** from day 1.  
5. **Quarterly valuation memo** (simple DCF multiple) stored in board minutes.  
6. **Track personal days in Germany meticulously**; once you can drop below 183 days you start the relocation clock.

## 5 What becomes *irreversible* if you ignore this guidance?

| Misstep | Why you can’t unwind it easily |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| **Stuffing IP into the German company now** | Later transfer triggers German transfer-pricing exit tax at full market value and 19 % VAT if cross-border. |
| **Letting valuation balloon before exit** | Exit tax is locked to fair market value on the day you leave; instalment plan just delays, doesn’t reduce. |
| **Opening U.S. LLC with you as manager** | Beneficial-owner data goes to FinCEN & likely the Bundeszentralamt für Steuern; anonymity gone forever. |
| **Taking outside investors into the German OpCo** | Shareholder protection rules complicate later seat-transfer or foreign merger; buying them out is costly. |

## 6 Three-Year Outlook Snapshot  

| Year | Tactical focus | Corporate move |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **2025** | Validate product-market fit; keep profits modest; lock in IP licence terms. | Only German UG. |
| **2026** | Ramp revenue; appoint non-resident director; open Swiss custody. | Consider holding-UG if valuation rising fast. |
| **2027** | Pre-value shares; file intent-to-convert resolution; scout UAE free-zone options. | Draft cross-border conversion documents under UmwandlungsG § 333. |
| **H1 2028** | Relocate residence; pay/finance exit tax; incorporate UAE holdco; migrate seat or do share transfer; cascade into Stiftung architecture. | German OpCo becomes subsidiary; Liechtenstein vault and ADGM control layer go live. |

### Executive Bottom Line

Stay **spartan** during your German residency: one lean UG, externalised IP, airtight documentation.  
Every euro of enterprise value you create *inside* Germany today is a euro the Finanzamt can tax on your way out.  
Your real optimisation window opens the day you cross the border; until then, play defence, not grand chess.

When you approach the six-month mark before relocation, we’ll draft the cross-border conversion paperwork and the Liechtenstein/UAE lattice. For now—incorporate, invoice, document, and keep the cap table clean.
