Better: "Design a six-week, two-books-per-week syllabus for a business-oriented solo founder focused on rapid prototyping and MVP experimentation. Prioritise the highest-leverage titles, sequence them for compounding learning, and attach fieldwork and decision checkpoints."

  

Here is a pragmatic, front-loaded plan. Two books per week. Each week has one "Build" title and one "Commercialise" title. Your cadence is simple: mornings for extraction, afternoons for application. Every book ends in a concrete output that compounds into the next week.

  

# Week 1 -- De-risk the problem, not the solution

  

Objective: eliminate idea delusion, surface riskiest assumptions, and set a falsification bar.

  

Build:

1. The Mom Test, Rob Fitzpatrick. Focus: interviewing discipline that prevents flattery and false positives. Output: 20 interview notes that capture pains, workarounds, budget, and current alternatives.

2. Running Lean, Ash Maurya. Focus: hypotheses, problem/solution fit, experiments. Output: a 1-page Lean Canvas and a top-3 "riskiest assumptions" list with pass/fail criteria.

  

Decision checkpoint: kill or continue based on explicit evidence thresholds, not intuition.

  

# Week 2 -- Prototypes that answer the only question that matters

  

Objective: produce a testable artifact and watch real users fail or succeed on tasks.

  

Build:

3) Sprint, Jake Knapp et al. Focus: five-day design sprint that compresses decision-making. Output: a clickable prototype and a 5-person task-based test plan.

4) Don't Make Me Think, Revisited, Steve Krug. Focus: pragmatic usability heuristics. Output: a "top 10 friction list" from observed sessions, each with a proposed fix.

  

Decision checkpoint: if two of five users fail the same critical task, refactor before adding features.

  

# Week 3 -- Instrumentation and channel selection

  

Objective: decide what to measure and where to hunt for demand.

  

Commercialise and Build:

5) Lean Analytics (latest O'Reilly edition), Croll and Yoskovitz. Focus: stage-appropriate metrics, One Metric That Matters, baseline setting. Output: an event schema, OMTM selection, dashboard stub.

6) Traction, Weinberg and Mares. Focus: 19 channels and the Bullseye process. Output: 6-channel short-list, 3 smoke tests with defined CAC proxy and success thresholds.

  

Decision checkpoint: drop channels that cannot clear your early CAC proxy within two iterations.

  

# Week 4 -- Positioning and pricing before code

  

Objective: decide who you win with and what they will pay, then validate willingness to pay.

  

Commercialise:

7) Obviously Awesome, April Dunford. Focus: positioning through competitive alternatives and value attributes. Output: a positioning canvas and a 50-word sales narrative.

8) Monetizing Innovation, Ramanujam and Tacke. Focus: price-before-product, offer-feature cuts guided by WTP. Output: 3 price fences and 2 offer packages for interviews or landing tests.

  

Decision checkpoint: if no segment shows clear WTP at target gross margin, pivot positioning or audience.

  

# Week 5 -- Founder-led sales and negotiation discipline

  

Objective: replace "demo theatre" with pipeline hygiene and process control.

  

Commercialise:

9) Founding Sales, Pete Kazanjy. Focus: discovery calls, pipeline math, founder-led GTM. Output: ICP definition, talk track, objection bank, and a CRM with 30 named prospects.

10) Start With No, Jim Camp. Focus: decision-based negotiation, agenda control, no-needs analysis. Output: a negotiation checklist and a red-line policy for discounts and scope.

  

Decision checkpoint: enforce a clean exit from non-buyers; remove zombie deals every Friday.

  

# Week 6 -- Make discovery and experiments perpetual

  

Objective: institutionalise weekly customer contact and valid tests.

  

Build:

11) Continuous Discovery Habits, Teresa Torres. Focus: weekly customer touchpoints, opportunity-solution trees. Output: a 12-week interview calendar, recruiting script, and OST for your top outcome.

12) Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments, Kohavi, Tang, Xu. Focus: experiment design, guardrails, stat power. Output: an experiment registry template, guardrail metrics, MDE calculator inputs.

  

Decision checkpoint: forbid ship-decisions from vanity metrics; require pre-registered hypotheses.

  

# How to read for leverage, not literature

1. Extraction pass, 90 minutes. Build a one-page brief per book: problem it solves, 3 tools, 5 "if X then Y" rules, 1 immediate field test.

2. Application pass, same day. Run a micro-experiment or artifact, even if ugly. Codify a template.

3. Evidence review, end of week. Compare observed data to pre-set thresholds. Cut ruthlessly.

  

# Outputs you will carry forward

  

• A validated problem statement and Lean Canvas (wk1).

• A prototype and usability fix list (wk2).

• An event schema, OMTM, channel shortlist, and three CAC probes (wk3).

• A positioning narrative, price fences, and offer packages (wk4).

• A working pipeline with scripts and a negotiation checklist (wk5).

• An interview cadence, OST, and experiment registry with guardrails (wk6).

  

# Trade-offs and substitutions

  

• If you already run credible interviews, compress Week 1 into The Mom Test only and start Sprint early.

• If your product is B2C growth first, swap "Founding Sales" for "Demand-Side Sales 101" to emphasise Jobs-to-be-Done buying progress.

• If you need broader product org context later, add "INSPIRED" after Week 6; useful once you are hiring or splitting roles.

• If you prefer a philosophy primer before all else, slot "The Lean Startup" as a pre-read; it frames the loop you will actually run in Weeks 1 to 6.

  

# Minimum viable study if time compresses

1. The Mom Test → Sprint → Lean Analytics → Obviously Awesome → Founding Sales → Continuous Discovery Habits. Six books that cover discovery, prototype, metrics, positioning, selling, and cadence.

  

If you want, I will package the one-page brief template and the experiment registry so you can log outputs from Week 1 onward.
