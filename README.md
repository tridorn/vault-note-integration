# Note Integration

## The Purpose of this Vault

is to consolidate all of the notes I created at some point earlier, and transform them into usable material for my new vault, Grimoire. 

## Part of this Vault

are all notes I created ever, most (about 3200) come from my Drafts archive, next is a cold storage archive of ancient notes (about 800), then my previous working vault (about 500 notes).

## This Vault functions

like a Kanban system. Untransformed notes start in 
1 To Process, which serves as the gathering and categorisation place for all notes. Categorised notes are moved to
2 Processing, in which they get summarised using AI (chatt new temporary chat for every note) using the [[Processing Prompt]]. The reason for AI summary boils down to the rather unwieldy size of what I need to functionally transform (around 4500 notes). Information will get lost in the process, but that's why I not only use Git, but also maintain parallel vaults with the respective notes in their original state.


## Glossary

- **Transform**: A process in which a note is processed, then consumed, and consequently deleted
- **Process**: A process in which the content of a note is stripped of its metadata and any decorations, and its content reduced in size by focusing it on its key points
- **Consume**: A process in which the processed (summarised) note is analysed, put into larger context (primarily a project it might be part of), mined for insights, and corresponding new notes created in my new vault
- **Categorise**: Group notes based on context and belonging
