### **1. Cloud Infrastructure: Expanding Control and Understanding Server Management**

**Current Context**: You’ve set up a basic cloud infrastructure using AWS or Google Cloud. Now, you should expand control over your environment, gaining confidence in managing cloud resources.

#### Next Steps

1. **Learning SSH**: 
	- You will need to become familiar with **SSH (Secure Shell)**, which allows secure remote access to your cloud server. 
	- Action: Download an SSH client like **PuTTY** (for Windows) or use your terminal (Mac/Linux).
	  - Learn the basic commands (e.g., `ssh -i path_to_key.pem user@ip_address`) to connect to your server. Cloud platforms often provide the exact connection command when you create your server.
	  - Practice file transfers using commands like `scp` (secure copy).
	
2. **Server Security Best Practices**:
	- Disable **root access** and create a new user with limited privileges (you will escalate privileges as needed with `sudo`).
	- Change the default SSH port from `22` to another random number to mitigate brute force attacks.
	- Regularly apply security patches and updates via package managers (e.g., `sudo apt-get update` for Ubuntu systems).

3. **Install Basic Services**:
	- Install **Apache** or **NGINX** to host web services. These are easy to install using package managers (`sudo apt install apache2`).
	- Configure **firewall settings** (AWS has **Security Groups**, which act as firewalls). Only open ports that you need (e.g., port 80 for web traffic, port 443 for SSL).

---

### **2. Centralized Data Management: Scaling Database Expertise**

**Current Context**: You’ve created a basic relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL). Now, it’s time to enhance database management skills and integrate this database into applications.

#### Next Steps

1. **SQL Mastery**: 
	- You should learn more advanced **SQL queries** to better manipulate and retrieve data. Focus on `JOIN` statements (for combining tables), `GROUP BY` (for aggregating data), and `INDEXING` (for speeding up queries).
	  - Use SQL tutorials and practice on sample databases. Platforms like **SQLZoo** provide interactive lessons.

2. **Database Security**:
	- Implement strong **password policies** for database users and restrict database access based on roles. Only allow access to users with the necessary permissions.
	- Enable **SSL encryption** between your application and the database to protect data in transit.
	- Periodically review access logs and set up automatic alerts for suspicious activity.

3. **Connecting Databases to Applications**:
	- If you’re using **WordPress** for your member portal, ensure that the database connection is properly configured in the `wp-config.php` file. Ensure you use secure credentials and encryption.
	- For more custom solutions, learn how to connect your Python-based data analytics (via **pandas** and **SQLAlchemy**) to pull data directly from the database. This will allow you to run data analysis scripts on live data, making the system more dynamic.

### **3. Cybersecurity Enhancements: Beyond Basics**

**Current Context**: You have implemented some basic cybersecurity protocols, like SSL and strong password policies. It’s time to elevate this.

#### Next Steps

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
	- Implement **MFA** for all critical systems. AWS, Google Cloud, and GitHub all support MFA. This adds an additional layer of security on top of passwords.
	- Research **Google Authenticator** or **Authy** for integrating MFA into your internal systems, especially if members are logging into the portal.

2. **Conduct Penetration Testing**:
	- Use tools like **OWASP ZAP** (Zed Attack Proxy) or **Burp Suite** to conduct basic penetration testing on your web applications.
	- This allows you to find vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection, giving you a proactive stance on security.
	- Even a basic scan will highlight areas that need improvement, and you can follow online guides on how to patch vulnerabilities.

3. **Log and Monitor All Activity**:
	- Implement **CloudTrail** (AWS) or **Cloud Audit Logs** (Google) to track all user activity. This will alert you to unauthorized access attempts and give you a clear picture of system usage.
	- Regularly review logs or set automated alerts if suspicious activity (like repeated failed login attempts) is detected.

### **4. Automation of Tasks: Leveraging Scripts and APIs**

**Current Context**: You’ve begun automating simple tasks using Trello and Slack integrations. Now, let’s explore scripting and automation to further ease your workload.

#### Next Steps

1. **Python Scripting for Automation**:
	- Learn basic **Python scripting** to automate repetitive tasks like:
	  - Backing up your database to cloud storage.
	  - Monitoring server resource usage and sending automated reports.
	  - Automating email notifications (e.g., for member registrations or event confirmations).
	- Use tools like **cron jobs** on your Linux server to schedule scripts that run periodically (e.g., nightly backups or daily server health checks).
	- Tutorials on Python scripting for automation are widely available (start with basic file management and web scraping).

2. **APIs for Integrating External Services**:
	- If you want to integrate financial data into your portal, learn how to use the **Yahoo Finance API** or **Alpha Vantage API**.
	- Use Python’s `requests` library to pull data from these APIs and display it in your member portal, allowing users to track live stock prices, financial reports, or market news.
