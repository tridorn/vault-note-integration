### Stop-Gap Summary  
**Anchor one bank.  Secure two backups.  Nail one use-case in one geography.  Incorporate “properly,” raise an institution-grade €2-3 M pre-seed, and build fast with a 90-day pilot deadline.**  

Below is the **prudent, speed-optimized path** that balances (i) the momentum you already have at ProCredit, (ii) the need for credibility with Tier-1 VCs, and (iii) the reality that spreading yourself too thin will kill velocity.

## 1 | Lock the Beach-Head (ProCredit) ─ Next 2 Weeks
| Step | What you do | Objective |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Confirm the pilot champion** | Email a crisp ½-page recap of the call, restate *one* concrete pilot proposal (e.g. “30 rooftop-solar loans in Serbia, <€2 M volume, 3-month window”), and ask for the follow-up slot with the colleague. | Turns “interest” into an internal calendar invite. |
| **Send an executive one-pager** | Include: pain, solution, pilot metrics, minimal tech burden, and a 90-day timeline. | Gives them a shareable artifact for internal alignment. |
| **Request data pack** | Politely ask for non-confidential numbers you need (typical green-loan ticket size, avg. underwriting time, etc.). | Shows seriousness; their willingness to share is a leading indicator of commitment. |

> **Goal:** An email from ProCredit stating *“Yes, we’re willing to scope this pilot when X returns.”*  

---

## 2 | De-Risk Concentration ─ Weeks 3-6 (in parallel)
1. **Line up two “Plan-B” banks**  
   *Same wedge* (SME rooftop solar) in the **same geography**. Use warm intros via incubator mentors, LinkedIn, EBRD climate officers.  
   - You’re not promising them exclusivity—only asking, *“If our first pilot fills up, may we schedule a discovery call?”*
2. **Onboard 5-10 flagship vendors** in that region (solar installers, energy-audit firms).  
   - Offer free leads during the pilot in exchange for data sharing and SLA commitment.

> **Why:** If ProCredit stalls, you still have a live pipeline; if they proceed, you gain negotiating leverage.

## 3 | Form the “Institution-Grade” Shell ─ Weeks 4-8
| Item | Reason | Quick tactic |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **HoldCo**: Delaware C-Corp (or NL BV/UK Ltd) | Instantly VC-legible cap table. | Off-the-shelf startup package; founders split ordinary shares, reserve 15 % option pool. |
| **OpCo**: German GmbH/UG **and** a local EE subsidiary (SRL) | Payroll, grants, vendor contracts. | Founder loans €12.5k to open a UG; upgrade to GmbH after seed. |
| **IP assignment & vesting** | Investors require clean IP & four-year vesting. | Sign PIIA + 4-year reverse-vesting among founders before any cheque arrives. |

---

## 4 | Pre-Seed Capital Sprint ─ Weeks 6-12
1. **Target cheque:** €2–3 M to fund 18 months burn (team ≤ 8, AWS, pilots, legal).  
2. **Lead list:** EU climate-fintech funds (Planet A, Extantia, World Fund), pan-EU Seed (Seedcamp, Point Nine), plus 3–4 strategic angels (ex-N26/Adyen execs, ex-EBRD).  
3. **Pitch narrative:**  
   - *Beach-head:* 30 SME solar loans, 40 % faster underwriting, €50k GMV per deal.  
   - *Fly-wheel:* Embedded lending rev-share → securitization → carbon credits.  
   - *Asks:* 12–18 month runway, introductions to debt funds, help on PSD2/credit-licence path.  
4. **Proof pack:** LOI or pilot MOU from ProCredit **plus** two “ready to talk” letters from backup banks, and signed vendor agreements.

> **Investors fund momentum + scarcity.** A live pilot date and two waiting banks create both.

## 5 | 90-Day Pilot Playbook (starts the day you get ProCredit “yes”)
| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **0** | Joint kick-off: confirm SME target list, vendor list, compliance checklist, data room access. |
| **2** | Beta portal live → first SME enters data → generate PDF packet #1. |
| **4** | First loan credit-approved; parallel onboarding of 3 more SMEs. |
| **8** | ≥15 projects submitted, ≥10 approved; collect time-to-yes metrics. |
| **12** | Pilot report: underwriting time cut >30 %; NPS (SME & bank) > 8; next-phase roadmap + pricing. |

---

## 6 | Parallel Commercial Fly-wheels
1. **Vendor lead fees live** once pilot hits 10 funded deals.  
2. **Bank SaaS licence** drafted in pilot MOU—kicks in after month 4.  
3. **Embedded-lender talks** with a specialist climate debt fund start in month 3 (they fund batch #2 loans, sharing interest spread).

---

## 7 | Focus Geography vs. Germany
- **Short-term:** Stay laser-focused on the Balkan/Eastern-EU wedge where ProCredit’s balance-sheet appetite and regulatory environment match lightweight pilots.  
- **Germany:** Use home base mainly for talent, grants (EXIST, Climate Tech), and investor credibility; do **not** split go-to-market energy yet.  
- **Expansion path:**  
  1. Nail solar in Serbia/Romania.  
  2. Clone solar in Bulgaria/North Macedonia with second bank.  
  3. Add **one** new product (HVAC) to first bank.  
  4. Enter Germany with both products once playbook is airtight and the KfW efficiency-house grant flow is integrated.

---

## 8 | Velocity & Signaling
- **Send a bi-weekly “pilot pulse” email** to ProCredit (and future investors): three bullets on progress, one ask, one metric.  
- **Publish** a short LinkedIn post each pilot milestone (no sensitive data) demonstrating traction—this is subtle FOMO marketing for other banks and VCs.  
- **Keep roadmap public-ish** (“Next up: EV-fleet module Q1 2026”) to show ambition without distraction.

### **If you execute the above 8 steps ruthlessly over the next 90–120 days, you will:**
1. Convert ProCredit from a polite “maybe” to a contractual design partner.  
2. Have a live revenue stream (vendor fees) within the pilot window.  
3. Show institutional investors that you can close a bank, recruit vendors, and move capital—*fast*.  

**Do not cultivate 10 banks or 5 products yet.  
Close one.  Ship.  Measure.  Amplify.**
