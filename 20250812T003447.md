If you want to take ‚Äúweekend projects‚Äù into the paid-value territory ‚Äî even if they‚Äôre disposable experiments ‚Äî there are a few extra layers to think about beyond just coding, hosting, and domains.

I‚Äôd break them into 7 categories: technical, legal, money, product, marketing, operational, and personal.

‚∏ª

1. Technical
	‚Ä¢	Security basics
	‚Ä¢	HTTPS (your host will handle it, but check it works).
	‚Ä¢	Never commit .env or secrets to Git.
	‚Ä¢	Use prepared statements or ORM (avoid SQL injection).
	‚Ä¢	Basic rate limiting to prevent abuse.
	‚Ä¢	Data protection
	‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôre storing user data, at least encrypt at rest (Supabase/Postgres does by default).
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt keep data you don‚Äôt need.
	‚Ä¢	Observability
	‚Ä¢	Sentry for error tracking from day one.
	‚Ä¢	PostHog/Plausible for analytics.
	‚Ä¢	Uptime monitoring (Better Stack, Cronitor).
	‚Ä¢	Backup/recovery
	‚Ä¢	If you use managed DB like Supabase/Neon, enable point-in-time restore.
	‚Ä¢	Keep an ‚Äúoh s***‚Äù recovery note for yourself (steps to revert).

‚∏ª

2. Legal & Compliance
	‚Ä¢	Terms of Service / Privacy Policy
	‚Ä¢	Even boilerplate AI-generated is better than nothing.
	‚Ä¢	If you store personal data or take payments, you must have these.
	‚Ä¢	GDPR / CCPA basics
	‚Ä¢	Allow users to delete their account and data.
	‚Ä¢	Tell users if you use cookies or tracking.
	‚Ä¢	Content policies
	‚Ä¢	If your app accepts user-generated content, have a way to remove abuse/spam.

‚∏ª

3. Money & Payments
	‚Ä¢	Stripe best practices
	‚Ä¢	Start with Stripe Checkout (no custom forms).
	‚Ä¢	Test in both test mode and live mode with your own card.
	‚Ä¢	One price at launch ‚Äî simplicity sells faster than tiers.
	‚Ä¢	Costs
	‚Ä¢	Keep infra < $20/month until revenue exists.
	‚Ä¢	Track renewals for domains/hosting to avoid surprise bills.
	‚Ä¢	Early pricing strategy
	‚Ä¢	Paid upfront if B2C (one-time or monthly).
	‚Ä¢	Free trial if B2B or productivity tools.

‚∏ª

4. Product Decisions
	‚Ä¢	MVP definition
	‚Ä¢	Deliver one complete ‚Äújob‚Äù from start to finish for the user.
	‚Ä¢	Strip all nice-to-have features until after first feedback.
	‚Ä¢	Value clarity
	‚Ä¢	The landing page must explain in 5 seconds: ‚ÄúWhat it is‚Äù + ‚ÄúWho it‚Äôs for‚Äù + ‚ÄúWhy it‚Äôs better/faster.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Retention hooks
	‚Ä¢	Email reminders, saved state, history/logs ‚Äî something to bring them back.

‚∏ª

5. Marketing
	‚Ä¢	Audience targeting
	‚Ä¢	Who do you want to see this? Where do they hang out?
	‚Ä¢	Launch plan
	‚Ä¢	Have 5‚Äì10 people lined up who will try it the day you launch.
	‚Ä¢	Ongoing drip
	‚Ä¢	Post updates/screenshots while building.
	‚Ä¢	Share small wins (‚Äújust got our first user in Japan üéâ‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Cross-promotion
	‚Ä¢	Link from your other projects or personal site so your ‚Äútraffic‚Äù compounds.

‚∏ª

6. Operational
	‚Ä¢	Support
	‚Ä¢	Decide: email, form, or chat.
	‚Ä¢	Even if you only check daily, having a channel builds trust.
	‚Ä¢	Feature requests
	‚Ä¢	Keep a single doc or Trello board for them.
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt build everything ‚Äî look for patterns.
	‚Ä¢	Sunset plan
	‚Ä¢	If you kill a project, post a short note: ‚ÄúThis experiment is retired, see my latest here.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Give paying users time to export their data.

‚∏ª

7. Personal / Strategic
	‚Ä¢	Time boxing
	‚Ä¢	Prevent perfectionism: limit v1 to 1‚Äì2 days of work.
	‚Ä¢	Portfolio building
	‚Ä¢	Treat each as a public case study of your speed + creativity.
	‚Ä¢	Even failed projects contribute to your reputation.
	‚Ä¢	Learning goals
	‚Ä¢	Rotate challenges: one project might focus on payments, another on AI, another on integrations.
	‚Ä¢	Energy management
	‚Ä¢	Fun matters ‚Äî the best micro-products come when you‚Äôre excited and curious.

‚∏ª

How this all ties together

You‚Äôre basically running a tiny product studio where:
	1.	You pick problems worth solving (fast research).
	2.	You ship minimal but functional products in days, not months.
	3.	You set them live with real payment + feedback loops.
	4.	You either double down (if people pay) or archive gracefully (if they don‚Äôt).
	5.	You keep your name/brand front and center so each launch increases your reach.

Over time:
	‚Ä¢	Your failed projects = proof of momentum.
	‚Ä¢	Your successful ones = recurring revenue or acquisitions.
	‚Ä¢	Your personal brand = deal flow, collabs, consulting, partnerships.

If you want, I can now sketch a ‚ÄúMicro-Product Studio‚Äù blueprint that combines all of this into a 12-week rhythm ‚Äî projects, domains, marketing, and sunset cycles ‚Äî so you always know what to build next and how to launch it for paid value.
