Absolutely. Let's construct a **schematic hierarchy** of how the **OSDC framework unfolds step by step**, and at **what moment key artifacts like hypotheses, issue trees, models, slides, and conclusions emerge**.

You're asking the right strategic question: _Where do I start, what comes out of each phase, and how do they interlink?_

Here's the **structured map of the OSDC workflow**, with outputs aligned to each step.

* * *

## **OSDC Hierarchy of Action + Outputs**

### **[1] ORIENT -- Define the Battlefield**

#### Objective:

Clarify what you're solving, what success looks like, and what's in scope.

#### Core Outputs:

- **Problem Statement**: one-line distilled definition of what needs to be solved

> "Client wants to reduce cost-to-serve in EMEA by 15% without damaging SLA performance."

- **Clarified Success Criteria**: deliverable format, level of depth, decision impact

> "Output = Excel model + 10-slide deck with recommendation for implementation path."
- **Initial Framing Question**: defines the core "Key Question" for analysis

> "How can cost-to-serve be reduced while maintaining service levels?"

#### Key Implication:

The **Key Question** becomes the **trunk** of the Issue Tree you'll build in Step 2.
* * *

### **[2] STRUCTURE -- Build the Thinking Machine**

#### Objective:

Break the problem into discrete drivers, then derive hypotheses for each.

#### Core Outputs:

- **Issue Tree** (or Hypothesis Tree):

    - Starts from Key Question → breaks into primary drivers or problem dimensions

> e.g., "Cost-to-serve" → Labor, Transport, Inventory, IT inefficiencies

    - Each branch contains **sub-questions** or **hypotheses**

> "Labor costs are inflated due to overtime inefficiency"

- **Slide Outline** (pre-analysis):

    - 1 slide per major node of the tree (eventually becomes your structure)

    - e.g., Slide 5 = "Labor cost reduction potential via process automation"
- **Prioritization of Workstreams**:

    - Which branches matter most (Impact × Ease matrix)

#### Key Implication:

Now you have **targeted hypotheses**, and these will **trigger your RAPT process** in Step 3.
* * *

### **[3] DRIVE -- Execute Analysis via RAPT**

> This is where **RAPT fully activates** inside OSDC.

#### Objective:

Prove or kill hypotheses through focused research and modeling.

#### Core Outputs (Per Hypothesis):

- **Mini Hypothesis Statement**: clear, testable claim

> "30% of overtime cost is avoidable via schedule optimization"

- **Evidence Table**:

    - For each claim: what data or logic is required to prove/disprove it

    - Sources, benchmarks, proxy indicators
- **Analytical Model or Calculation**:

    - Driver-based logic in Excel: input assumptions → outputs → sensitivities

    - e.g., Scenario model of cost impact from labor scheduling changes
- **Preliminary Slide Drafts**:

    - Each hypothesis, once tested, is **immediately dropped into slide format**:

> Title = Conclusion  
Chart = Proof  
Bottom = Implication

#### Key Implication:

You are now producing **slide-ready insights**, not just raw data. These become building blocks for your story in Step 4.

* * *

### **[4] COMMUNICATE -- Package the Thinking**

#### Objective:

Synthesize, defend, and persuade using structured narrative.

#### Core Outputs:

- **Executive Summary Slide**: 1-slide answer

> "Client can cut €3.5M in costs via 3 targeted changes--without SLA degradation"

- **Slide Deck Narrative**:

    - Ordered flow of logic:

        1. Situation

        2. Problem/Goal

        3. Drivers

        4. Analysis findings (RAPT outputs)

        5. Recommendation

        6. Implementation suggestion or risks

- **Talk Track / Defense Script**:

    - For each slide:

        - "Why this slide exists"

        - "What we're proving"

        - "Anticipated pushback + rebuttal"

#### Key Implication:

The final deck isn't decoration--it's a **map of proven reasoning** that walks a decision-maker from ambiguity to action.
* * *

## **Summary: Top-Down Tree of Outputs**
    
    
    [ORIENT]
       └── Problem Statement
       └── Key Question
    
    [STRUCTURE]
       └── Issue Tree / Hypothesis Tree (branches of Key Question)
       └── Slide Outline (preliminary)
    
    [DRIVE] -- uses RAPT
       └── Hypothesis Statements (from tree)
       └── Evidence Tables (what to prove)
       └── Analytical Models (minimal but structured)
       └── Slide Drafts (1 per proven hypothesis)
    
    [COMMUNICATE]
       └── Executive Summary
       └── Final Deck (logic flow)
       └── Talk Track / Defense Notes

This is how everything connects. Each level _builds logic on top of the last_, and nothing exists for its own sake.
