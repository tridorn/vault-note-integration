Understood.  
Here is the same thing, boiled down to **the clearest, most basic language possible**, without jargon:

---

# What We Are Actually Building

We are building a **software platform** that helps:

- Small and medium businesses (SMEs) get green loans faster and cheaper,  
- Banks approve these loans with less work and less risk,  
- Vendors (like solar installers) sell their equipment more easily,  
- Governments and regulators see that the money is really being used for green projects.

---

# How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. **The SME wants to do a green project**  
   (for example: put solar panels on their roof or install a heat pump).

2. **They go to our platform** and answer a few basic questions.  
   (We also automatically pull their financial data — with their permission — like energy bills and bank transactions.)

3. **Our platform matches them** to a good vendor who can install what they need.  
   (We already checked that these vendors are trustworthy.)

4. **Our platform builds a full loan application file**, automatically:  
   - It shows why the project is “green” (officially recognized under EU rules),  
   - It shows how much money it will save (and that it makes financial sense),  
   - It attaches government guarantees that lower the risk for the bank.

5. **The bank receives this ready-made file**, all complete and verified.  
   The bank just has to say *yes* or *no*. No back-and-forth, no endless paperwork.

6. **After the project is built**, small devices (like smart meters) keep measuring energy savings.  
   This proves the project is real and successful, without any manual inspections.

# Why This Is Valuable

- **For SMEs:** They get financing much faster, with less hassle and at better rates.  
- **For Banks:** They spend almost no time checking green loans. They get all proof they need for regulators, in one click.  
- **For Vendors:** They sell more projects because their customers can easily afford them.  
- **For Governments:** They can track that green money is actually doing what it should (saving energy and reducing emissions).

---

# What Makes Us Different

- Other platforms just match people to loans.  
  **We do the heavy lifting**: we *prove* everything needed for green finance (energy savings, government rules, guarantees).

- Once a bank uses our platform to approve loans, **it becomes hard for them to stop**.  
  (Because we keep sending them live energy data from the project — they can’t easily switch away.)

# Super Short Analogy

> It's like **TurboTax for green loans** — but instead of filing taxes, you're making sure the SME gets cheap money to go green, and the bank gets all the proof it needs instantly.

---

# Even Shorter:

**We make green loans for small businesses fast, easy, and safe — by doing all the paperwork, proof, and connections automatically.**

Would you like me to also sketch a simple visual diagram for this (like a flowchart)?  
It could make it even clearer in one glance.
