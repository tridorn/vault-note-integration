**Visualization Framework:**

To visualize these virtues distinctly, consider a **virtue wheel** or **spoke diagram**, where each virtue is a spoke radiating from the central concept of "The Modern Strategist." Each spoke represents a unique trait with a visual icon or metaphor at the end to symbolize its essence. This structure ensures clarity and delineation of each virtue while collectively portraying the character's comprehensive profile.
