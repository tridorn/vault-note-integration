Perfect. You're asking for **a unified consulting operating system**--a _top-down mental map_ of what a consultant is tasked with, **how the terrain is structured**, and what precise intellectual weapons are used at each level.

So here is your **Consulting Competency Matrix**, designed as a **fully delineated framework**--from _Purpose_ to _Mechanics_--to end all fragmentation.

* * *

## **I. THE CORE MANDATE OF CONSULTING**

> **"Impose clarity on ambiguity, generate insight under pressure, and deliver solutions that move the client's needle."**

This mandate bifurcates into **three overarching responsibilities**:

1. **Problem Solving** -- Break down complex client challenges, frame them logically, and solve them rigorously.

2. **Communication** -- Convert solutions into narrative assets that clients trust, understand, and act on.

3. **Execution Support** -- Where applicable, help implement the recommendations or enable decision-making.

Each of these contains **delineated domains of action**. Below: the complete top-down map.

## **II. THE CONSULTING OPERATING SYSTEM (4 DOMAINS, 12 SUB-SKILLS)**

| Domain | Sub-Skill | Objective | Tools / Methods | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 1. PROBLEM DEFINITION | 1.1 Problem Reframing | Define what is _really_being asked | Situation--Complication--Key Q, Hypothesis Framing | 
|  | 1.2 Structuring | Decompose problem logically | MECE Trees, Issue Trees, Logic Flows | 
|  | 1.3 Prioritization | Focus effort on high-leverage areas | Impact vs. Effort, Pareto, Hypothesis Value Testing | 
| 2. ANALYSIS & INSIGHT | 2.1 Research | Pull only high-yield validation data | RAPT Method, Benchmarks, Industry Reports | 
|  | 2.2 Modeling | Quantify insight and simulate scenarios | Driver Trees, Excel Models, Sensitivity Analysis | 
|  | 2.3 Synthesis | Extract insight and make judgment calls | Pyramid Principle, T-L-I Method (Title-Logic-Implication) | 
| 3. COMMUNICATION | 3.1 Slide Craft | Package logic visually and succinctly | 1 Insight/Slide, Storyboarding, Minto Titles | 
|  | 3.2 Narrative Architecture | Construct persuasive storylines | Situation→Complication→Resolution, SCQA, Top-Down Flow | 
|  | 3.3 Executive Presence | Defend thinking and inspire confidence | Talk Tracks, Anticipated Objections, Assertive Delivery | 
| 4. CLIENT & FIRM NAVIGATION | 4.1 Stakeholder Calibration | Align with client and internal sponsors | "Backbriefing," Pre-wiring, Client Listening | 
|  | 4.2 Expectation & Scope Management | Avoid misalignment and scope creep | Briefing Notes, Change Logs, 80/20 Trade-offs | 
|  | 4.3 Feedback Looping & Learning | Self-optimize through post-mortems | After Action Reviews, Slide Deltas, Knowledge Logs |

## **III. HOW TO ENGAGE EACH DOMAIN TACTICALLY**

### **1. Problem Definition**

- **Start with clarity**: Write out the one-sentence problem.
- Build **issue trees** to exhaust the space.
- Apply **value screens**: What parts of this problem are decision-critical?

### **2. Analysis & Insight**

- **For each branch of the issue tree**, write a hypothesis.
- Design **research targets** per hypothesis. Do not drift.
- Build **minimal models** to test business logic, not beautify Excel.
- At the end, extract 2--3 _hard insights_ from every model or dataset.

### **3. Communication**

- Every slide = 1 insight. Never decorate without logic.
- Use the **Pyramid Principle**: Conclusion first, then reasoning, then support.
- Storyline = Problem → Why It Matters → Drivers → Solution → Implications
- Practice the _verbal version_--if you can't defend it, it's not real.

### **4. Navigation**

- Never surprise a stakeholder. Pre-wire all major insights before formal delivery.
- For partners: turn deliverables into "thinking artifacts" early, not just final files.
- After projects: log what got changed in your slides, and why--that's your hidden curriculum.

## **IV. THE THREE CORE MODES OF CONSULTANT ACTIVITY**

| Mode | When Active | Goal | Mental Posture | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Design** | At project start or pivot points | Frame the problem | Architect | 
| **Proof** | During analysis and modeling | Validate or reject logic | Prosecutor | 
| **Packaging** | After insight is crystallized | Persuade with clarity | Storyteller | 

**Switch modes consciously. Never mix.** Don't beautify while thinking. Don't pitch before validating. Segmentation enforces sharpness.
* * *

## **V. HOW YOU USE THIS: WORKPLAN DESIGN**

Every time you're handed a client task or project module:

1. **Map it to domains:**  
"Am I solving a problem? Communicating one? Analyzing?"

2. **Apply the appropriate sub-skills:**  
If analyzing → form hypotheses → design minimal models → synthesize insights.

3. **Use the deliverable as a thinking vehicle:**  
A slide or model is just a visible surface--** the real value is in the structure that produced it.**
