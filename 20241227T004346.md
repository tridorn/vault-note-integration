“The key to the German command system of Auftragstaktik (mission-oriented tactics) was the commander’s intent (Absicht). Subordinate leaders were always supposed to understand why they were being ordered to execute any task. This gave the subordinate commanders the flexibility to use work-arounds, when necessary, to achieve the final intent.”
