**Correction of your request:**
“Please rebuild the structure from the ground up and give me a better segmentation aligned with what we talked about a bit above” → “Provide a fully re-engineered customer segmentation that supersedes the current ten-item list and coheres with the functional, influence-based logic outlined earlier.”

## PRINCIPLES APPLIED

1. **Function in value chain, not job title.**
2. **Predictive behavioural divergence.** Each segment must drive a distinct commercial or technical treatment.
3. **Region-agnostic.** Works unchanged in every geography; only tactics localise.
4. **Mutual exclusivity.** One account belongs in exactly one primary segment.
5. **Exhaustive coverage.** No relevant customer left unclassified.

## RE-ENGINEERED SEGMENTATION (PRIMARY AXIS)

| #     | Segment Name        | Core Function                                                                    | Typical Actors (old labels)                              | Strategic Levers                                                      |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Specifiers**      | Define technical requirements and lock product into the spec sheet               | Planner, Architect (from Planner), PreFab design offices | Influence spec standards, digital configurators, early-phase training |
| **2** | **Gatekeepers**     | Control budget, contract award, and risk                                         | Developer / General Contractor                           | Value-engineering arguments, risk-mitigation proof, bundled offers    |
| **3** | **Assemblers**      | Physically integrate product on site or in factory modules                       | Installer, MFH & PreFab Bathroom Builders                | Installation simplicity, time-savings, on-site support, kitting       |
| **4** | **Channel Sellers** | Resell and stock product; act as availability and pricing interface              | Wholesaler, Showroom, eRetailer, DIY retail chains       | Margin structure, inventory programmes, promo funding, digital feeds  |
| **5** | **Operators**       | Own, operate, and maintain the installed system; live with performance long-term | End-User, Facility Management                            | Reliability, UX, energy efficiency, service contracts                 |

**DIY end-users** fold into **Operators**—they act as self-installing owners, not a separate commercial archetype.

## WHY THIS IS SUPERIOR

| Failure in Old Schema                                             | Resolution in New Schema                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Role overlap (e.g., PreFab appeared twice as planner + assembler) | Single unambiguous placement under **Assemblers**                 |
| Channel entities mixed with decision influencers                  | **Channel Sellers** isolated; spec and budget influence separated |
| No behavioural anchor (titles, not functions)                     | Segments defined by *what they do*, not *what they are called*    |
| Region-specific quirks baked in (e.g., MFH)                       | Region remains a **secondary attribute**; segmentation unchanged  |

## SECONDARY DIMENSIONS (APPLIED AFTER PRIMARY SEGMENT ASSIGNMENT)

1. **Region** (North/East/South/West/Central) – localises tactics, never changes segment.
2. **Project Context** – New Build vs Renovation, Property Type.
3. **Influence Weight** – Final / Influencer / End-User.

These layers refine go-to-market playbooks without fragmenting the core segmentation.

## MIGRATION MATRIX (OLD ➜ NEW)

| Old Label                      | New Segment                                                                |

| Installer                      | Assemblers                                                                 |

| Developer / General Contractor | Gatekeepers                                                                |
| Wholesaler                     | Channel Sellers                                                            |
| Showroom                       | Channel Sellers                                                            |
| DIY (Retail)                   | Channel Sellers (store) **and** Operators (buyer) – choose by account role |
| PreFab                         | Assemblers (factory integrator)                                            |
| eRetailer                      | Channel Sellers                                                            |
| Facility Management            | Operators                                                                  |
| MFH & PreFab Bathroom Builders | Assemblers                                                                 |

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

1. **Account Mapping:** One-time sweep of CRM; assign each account a primary segment tag.
2. **VoC Re-Tagging:** Recode historical feedback to new segment IDs for trend continuity.
3. **Playbook Alignment:**

   * **Specifiers:** Invest in BIM tools, CPD accredited training.
   * **Gatekeepers:** Produce total-cost-of-ownership calculators.
   * **Assemblers:** Offer pre-assembled kits and on-site tech reps.
   * **Channel Sellers:** Rationalise discount ladders, feed real-time stock APIs.
   * **Operators:** Launch post-install service bundles and performance dashboards.
4. **Performance Metrics:** Track NPS, margin, and repeat business per segment; course-correct quarterly.

This architecture is lean, behaviour-true, and ready for executive scrutiny and operational adoption.
