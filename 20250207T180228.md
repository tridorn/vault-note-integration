# **üí∞ Starting Capital: How Much to Trade with Initially**

### **1. General Guideline: Start Small, Minimize Risk**
- For beginners, it‚Äôs crucial to start with **just enough capital to gain real market experience without risking significant losses.**  
- A **minimum of ‚Ç¨2,000-‚Ç¨5,000** is typically recommended for **micro futures (e.g., MES, MNQ)** because they require lower margins and offer flexibility in scaling up.

**Why Start Small:**  
- You‚Äôll encounter **emotional differences** between live trading and paper trading (fear of loss, greed, overtrading).  
- Starting small allows you to **focus on discipline and refining execution** without risking too much capital.

### **Recommended Starting Capital by Contract Type:**
| **Contract Type**      | **Minimum Capital (‚Ç¨)** | **Reason**                                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Micro Futures (MES, MNQ)** | ‚Ç¨2,000‚Äì‚Ç¨5,000             | Lower margins (~‚Ç¨50-100 per contract) reduce risk.    |
| **Mini Futures (ES, NQ)**    | ‚Ç¨10,000+                   | Higher margin requirements (~‚Ç¨1,000 per contract).    |

*üéØ **For you:** Begin with **micro contracts** to keep your risk per trade manageable.*

### **2. How Much to Risk Per Trade: The 1-2% Rule**
Regardless of starting capital, you should **risk no more than 1-2% of your total capital per trade.**

**Example:** Starting with a ‚Ç¨5,000 account:  
- Max risk per trade (1%): ‚Ç¨50  
- If trading **Micro E-mini S&P 500 (MES)**:  
  - 1 point = $5 (‚Ç¨4.50)  
  - Stop-loss = ~10-12 points  
  - Trade size = 1-2 contracts

This ensures **even after a string of losses, your account won‚Äôt face large drawdowns.**

## **üìà Adding Funds or Scaling Up Over Time**

### **1. When to Add Money**
You should only add funds when:
- **You‚Äôve demonstrated consistent profitability** (e.g., 3+ consecutive profitable months).  
- Your **drawdowns have been minimal (below 5-10% monthly).**  
- You‚Äôre ready to scale up from micro contracts to **mini contracts** (ES, NQ) to access larger profits.

**How to Add Money Safely:**  
- Add **small, incremental amounts (e.g., ‚Ç¨1,000-2,000)** at a time.  
- Avoid adding funds to ‚Äúchase losses‚Äù after a losing streak‚Äîthis is a common beginner trap.

---

### **2. When to Remove Profits**
**Don‚Äôt withdraw too early or too frequently.** Instead, follow this structure:

- **Until 12 months:** Focus on **compounding returns** by reinvesting profits.  
- **After 12 months:** Consider **withdrawing 20-30% of monthly profits** to secure gains.  
- **Annual milestone:** Withdraw a larger percentage (e.g., 50% of profits) at the end of each year.

**Why:** Compounding is key to long-term success. Frequent withdrawals reduce the account‚Äôs growth potential.

---

### **3. When to Reduce Account Size**
- **If drawdowns exceed 15-20% of initial capital:** Reduce trading size or withdraw funds to prevent further losses.  
- **Reevaluate your strategy:** Extended drawdowns often indicate issues with execution, discipline, or strategy adaptation.

## **üìä Example Progression Plan (Starting with ‚Ç¨5,000)**

| **Phase**        | **Capital (‚Ç¨)** | **Monthly Growth Target (3%)** | **When to Add/Withdraw**                       |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Months 0-3**   | 5,000           | Small, focus on breakeven      | No additions; focus on risk management         |
| **Months 3-6**   | 5,150‚Äì5,500     | Build consistency              | Add ‚Ç¨1,000 if profitable and disciplined       |
| **Months 6-12**  | 6,000‚Äì7,500     | Compounding gains              | Reinvest profits; avoid early withdrawals      |
| **Months 12+**   | 7,500‚Äì10,000+   | Scale up to mini contracts     | Gradually add funds and withdraw 20-30% yearly |

## **üö´ Common Pitfalls to Avoid When Managing Capital**
1. **Adding funds after losses:** This is a psychological trap and leads to overtrading.  
   - **Solution:** Reassess your strategy before adding funds.  
   
2. **Over-leveraging:** Scaling contracts too quickly when profits increase leads to large drawdowns.  
   - **Solution:** Only scale up contracts when your win rate and profit factor are stable over time.

3. **Withdrawing too soon:** Early withdrawals hinder compounding.  
   - **Solution:** Set milestones (e.g., yearly withdrawals of larger sums).
