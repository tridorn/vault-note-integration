### How to elevate the **ProCredit-specific dossier**  
Below is a concrete upgrade path that (1) re-orders the flow for internal bankers, (2) deepens the information they are most likely to ask for next, and (3) trims or tucks away what is “nice to know.”  
After the table you’ll find **ready-to-paste expanded copy** for every new or beefed-up section.

| Section (old order)              | Keep / Move / Expand? | Why                                                      | New Depth / Addition                                                     |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 Executive Summary              | **Keep** (but compress to 5 bullets) | Bank execs skim first; make it tighter.                 | Add one “Why ProCredit wins first” bullet.                               |
| 2 Market Pain Table              | **Move down** (after Solution)       | Hook them with solution before listing problems (classic banker preference: “show me the upside, then justify”). | None—copy stays.                                                         |
| 3 Solution Diagram               | **Keep & rename “How Veridian Fits in ProCredit’s Workflow”** | Relabel so they see it’s bespoke.                       | Overlay ProCredit logo on the “Bank” node; add a coloured band “Credit Desk” so they recognise their department. |
| 4 Pilot Capsule                  | **Expand into two slides**           | Biggest internal hurdle is scope clarity.               | **Add**: detailed vendor list placeholder, credit-policy assumptions, and risk controls. |
| — (**NEW**) Strategic Fit Box    | *Insert directly after Solution*     | Show that what you do ladders up to their published strategy slides. | 3 bullet tie-ins (ESG targets, SME segment CAGR, cost-to-income ratio).  |
| 5 Why It Pays (ROI table)        | **Keep, add IRR column**             | Credit people care about IRR, not just margin.          | Show IRR uplift (e.g. 14 % → 18 %).                                       |
| 6 Compliance & Security Grid     | **Keep, add “Next Audit Dates” row** | They’ll ask “when can we audit?”                        | Put Q4–25 ISO/pen-test, Q2–26 full ISAE 3402.                             |
| 7 Business Model Matrix          | **Shrink in bank version**           | They don’t care about your investor story—just pricing. | Trim to one line: “Veridian fee borne by vendor; no cost for ProCredit until Year 2 SaaS licence.” |
| 8 Team                           | **Move to appendix**                 | Not critical for internal distribution.                 | NA                                                                        |
| 9 Impact Snapshot                | **Keep**                             | Helps ESG champion inside bank.                         | Add “maps to Pillar 3 banking disclosure lines 2 & 5.”                    |
| 10 Next Steps Table              | **Keep, add columns**                | Add “Internal Owner” and “Earliest Date”—makes taking action trivial. | Populate example names (e.g. “IT Security – M. Ionescu”).                |
| — (**NEW**) “Three Common Objections & Ready Answers” box | *Tiny* | Pre-empts pushback; saves your champion time. | See copy below.                                                          |

## Expanded / added copy snippets  
*(ready to paste into Word, PowerPoint, or Figma frames)*

### ❶ Executive Summary (compressed 5-bullet style)  

> **Veridian in 30 seconds**  
> 1. **Problem**  – SME green loans are < 2 % of total lending (EBA 2023) because data collection and Taxonomy checks are manual and expensive.  
> 2. **Solution**  – A single wizard that outputs an EU-Taxonomy-aligned packet; ProCredit underwriters receive 100 %-complete files in minutes.  
> 3. **Pilot**  – 25 rooftop-solar SMEs, Bucharest region, 12 weeks; success = ≥ 40 % underwriting-time cut & ≥ €1 m financed.  
> 4. **Strategic Fit**  – Directly boosts ProCredit’s 2026 ESG volume target and cost-to-income KPI (slide 22 of ProCredit FY-23 deck).  
> 5. **Ask**  – Approve data access + sign 6-page MoU by **DD-MM-YYYY**; zero integration cost, kill-switch if KPIs unmet.

---

### ❷ Strategic Fit Box (insert after Solution)

> **How Veridian maps onto ProCredit’s published goals**  
> • **ESG portfolio ≥ 25 % by 2026** → Veridian pipeline makes < €100 k tickets profitable.  
> • **SME CAGR targeted 7 % (Investor Day 2024)** → Faster approvals raise throughput without extra FTE.  
> • **Cost-to-income < 58 %** → –40 % manual hours per file directly lowers opex.

| Loan Volume Target | €1 000 000 (25 × €40 k) |

### ❻ Three Common Objections & Ready Answers

> **1. “We already plan to digitalise green loans internally.”**  
> *Answer:* *Great—our wizard plugs in as a front-end to your roadmap; no double work, but immediate ROI.*

> **2. “What if technical screening criteria change again?”**  
> *Answer:* *Our rules engine is modular; we update centrally within 72 h of EU delegated-act changes—no workload for your team.*

> **3. “Small-ticket loans won’t move the needle.”**  
> *Answer:* *Scaling 25 loans/branch/year across 100 branches = €100–150 m extra ESG book, with opex nearly unchanged.*

---

### ❼ Pricing Line (trimmed matrix)

> **Commercial** – For pilot **zero fees** to ProCredit.  
> Thereafter: *optional* SaaS licence from Year 2 (Tier 1 €25 k/yr; Tier 2 €50 k/yr) **only if** KPI targets met.  
> Vendor-side success fee (1.9 %) already embedded in project price—no impact on NPV for ProCredit or SME.

## What to drop or move to appendix  

- **Full team bios** → Appendix A.  
- **Long-form market sizing** → Appendix B (one chart).  
- **Long-term securitisation vision** → leave for investor deck; not needed now.

---

### Final assembly suggestion  

1 page = Executive Summary + Solution Diagram + Fit Box  
2 page = add Pilot Scope + Risk/Control + Next Steps  
Optional 3–4 pages with ROI table + Impact + Compliance grid in appendix.

That gives your champion a **concise internal handout** (< 4 MB PDF) that anticipates objections, highlights strategic fit, and sets a decision clock.
