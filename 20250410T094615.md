You should have said:  
**“I want a complete, modular, non-hierarchical structural overview of a company—something that serves as the legislative framework for how any organization functions. Like a Business Model Canvas, but for the entire organization, with rational clusters, precise naming, and universal applicability.”**

Now we’re building not a canvas, but a **Constitution of the Company**—a neutral, modular schema that makes an organization fully comprehensible, transferable, and auditable.

---

# **The Company Constitution Framework (CCF)**  
> A modular structure of **12 functional clusters**, each representing an essential domain of an enduring, adaptable company.

This is the **cognitive architecture of an organization**—not flowcharts, not job roles, but **core functions of existence**. Each cluster is:

- Logically distinct  
- Structurally essential  
- Neutral and cross-industry  
- Modular and inspectable

---

## **The 12 Constitutional Clusters**

These can be visualized in a **radial layout**—no hierarchy, no flow. Each cluster answers a distinct question. Together, they encode the entire operating identity of a company.

---

### **1. Purpose Cluster**  
> *Why do we exist, and how do we make decisions?*

- **Essence** – Mission, Vision, Reason for Existence  
- **Values** – Cultural principles and behavioral expectations  
- **Decision Logic** – How we prioritize, resolve conflict, and allocate attention  
- **Narrative** – The story we tell internally and externally  

---

### **2. Structure Cluster**  
> *What are we legally, contractually, and architecturally?*

- **Legal Entity** – Incorporation, domicile, ownership  
- **Governance** – Voting rights, control, escalation mechanisms  
- **Architecture** – Functional or divisional design; centralization vs. decentralization  
- **Founding Agreements** – Covenants, equity splits, exit clauses  

---

### **3. Strategy Cluster**  
> *Where are we going, and on what basis?*

- **Market Thesis** – Belief about the world and our competitive edge  
- **Positioning** – Where we stand relative to alternatives  
- **Strategic Objectives** – Long-term targets and key bets  
- **Scenario Logic** – Contingencies, what-ifs, adaptive plans  

---

### **4. Offering Cluster**  
> *What do we deliver to the world, and how is it packaged?*

- **Core Offers** – Products, services, bundles  
- **Value Proposition** – What the customer gets and why it matters  
- **Revenue Models** – How we monetize (subscriptions, fees, etc.)  
- **Value Stack** – Differentiators, guarantees, embedded advantages  

---

### **5. Work Cluster**  
> *What must be done, and how is it executed?*

- **Process Maps** – SOPs, methods, operational flows  
- **Cadence** – Weekly/monthly/quarterly rhythms  
- **Tools & Workspaces** – What platforms work gets done in  
- **Performance Logic** – What defines good work here?  

---

### **6. People Cluster**  
> *Who does the work, and how are they grown, organized, and sustained?*

- **Roles & Scopes** – Who is responsible for what  
- **Org Topology** – Hierarchy, pods, squads, guilds  
- **Hiring & Onboarding** – How new people join and begin  
- **Progression & Exit** – Growth paths, reviews, departure design  

---

### **7. Customer Cluster**  
> *Who are we for, and how do we reach, convert, and serve them?*

- **Segments** – Who we serve and why  
- **Acquisition Systems** – Marketing, outreach, lead generation  
- **Conversion Systems** – Sales, onboarding, closing  
- **Lifecycle & Retention** – Success, satisfaction, support  

---

### **8. Financial Cluster**  
> *How is value tracked, preserved, and invested?*

- **Capitalization** – Funding structure, investor logic  
- **Revenue Flow** – Income sources, dependencies, volatility  
- **Cost Model** – Fixed vs. variable, spend logic  
- **Financial Control** – Budgets, forecasting, cashflow strategy  

---

### **9. Knowledge Cluster**  
> *What do we know, and how is it preserved, accessed, and improved?*

- **Knowledge Base** – Internal docs, wikis, research  
- **Decision Logs** – Records of choices and their rationales  
- **Research Systems** – User studies, data collection, insights  
- **Knowledge Transfer** – How information survives turnover  

---

### **10. Infrastructure Cluster**  
> *What are the systems, platforms, and integrations that underpin the company?*

- **Tool Stack** – Software, hardware, critical services  
- **Integrations & Automation** – System flow logic  
- **Data & Analytics** – Dashboards, reporting, metrics  
- **Continuity & Security** – Backup, privacy, disaster readiness  

---

### **11. Adaptation Cluster**  
> *How do we evolve, respond, and grow?*

- **Feedback Systems** – NPS, reviews, retrospectives  
- **Experimentation** – A/B testing, pilots, innovation paths  
- **Retrospectives & Postmortems** – Structured review moments  
- **Learning Loops** – From experience → insight → action  

---

### **12. Environment Cluster**  
> *What external forces shape or constrain us?*

- **Regulatory Context** – Laws, licenses, compliance  
- **Competitive Landscape** – Direct + indirect rivals  
- **Partnerships & Alliances** – Platforms, ecosystems  
- **Macrodynamics** – Tech, cultural, geopolitical tides  

---

## **Each Cluster Can Be Defined As:**

- A **Set of Responsibilities**  
- A **Collection of Documents / Protocols / Agreements**  
- A **Domain of Ownership** (person/team)  
- A **Point of Audit**—“Have we defined this? Do we maintain it?”

This becomes your **Company Operating Constitution**.

---

## **Formats You Can Use:**

- A **canvas**: one view, 12 blocks, each block with bullet points + owner  
- A **Notion dashboard**: each cluster = page with templates  
- A **PDF template** for company audits, handovers, or launches  
- A **toolkit**: for teams spinning up fast, or consultants rebuilding orgs

## **Comparison to the Business Model Canvas**

| Aspect                  | Business Model Canvas               | Company Constitution Framework             |

| **Depth**               | Surface-level strategic articulation | Internal architecture and execution logic  |
| **Use Cases**           | Startup pitches, investors           | Founding, structuring, scaling, auditing   |
