title: On the Nature of Tasks
abstract: 'This note contains my thoughts on how our desire for tasks to be trackable has lead to the abstraction of them in a way that distorts our perception of them away from the underlying "thing to do" to a clickable concept.'

# On the Nature of Tasks

---

## List

1. Tasks in a task management system are not something to be worked on themselves, you don't move the work from the real world and into a task management system. When you finish the task you didn't achieve the body in the task management system
2. Neither are tasks less than construct solely existing in task management system. (Refine, had something here but forgot)
3. Tasks in task management systems are nothing more than reminders of the real work to be done. This is why not everything must be captured, not everything formalised. It doesn't matter which form it takes, you simply have to be reminded in any way
