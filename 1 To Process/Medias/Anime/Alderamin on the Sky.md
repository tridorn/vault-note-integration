# Alderamin on the Sky

This anime feels like its "true". It is hard to put into words, but just like when talking to someone truly intelligent their words have a weight on their own and feel exactly right placed, the scenes of this anime feel like they have some weight. Even tho I have discovered over time that sometimes reality is the greatest fiction, the scenes feel realistic.  
On a side note, I have wondered about where this interpretation of fiction as realistic or unrealistic comes from. It definitely changes from person to person, yet the reality is not interpreted as being realistic or not. Maybe it comes from the word itself "realistic" - "reality" or of being similar to what happen in real life instead of fiction. I think that an interpretation of someone of a fictional scene can give clues about their character, but without having any proof for that I would say that when viewed at large the opinions of people if something is realistic or not do not diverge too much, if this would come from similar experiences then that would be probably not right as people have made vastly different experiences. It probably comes from us humans - at our core - being similar animals, something that can be viewed in different contexts (insert if you have that thought at least one person else had it before or has it).  
The characters are not farces of their characterization but believable entities, not only in the context of a Japanese anime but also of reality.

The protagonist is truly out of pocket at times and is handled differently than in other animes, case of point being "oblivious protagonist". His dualism with the red headed girl shines through at this point, she is the right hand and the very embodiment of etiquette and fighting force, he is the left hand, the unusual ('eccentric') strategic genius. While many anime like to retaliate anything even closely resembling an act of pervertion, this one does great in giving it some touch of reality by not overly scolding (it sometimes feel like the poor protagonists are getting assaulted, some can truly call themselves survivors, it seem blown out of relation at times) the protagonist (who is designed as a womanizer) but rather fitting it in the bigger frame of her being the one enforcing etiquette or I would even say social norms.

Episode 7 The Northern Katjvarna Rebellion

The location is the Northern Area. The whole group is in the local Imperial Fort and is tasked of delivering supplies to a major supply depot. It touches on some mildly interesting philosopical - theological questions around the scientific method, questioning your own practices and so on. There exist spirits ("great spirits", earth, wind, water, fire) in this world that (following the religion of Aldebaran) are born by the god Aldebaran and chose their own human partner. These spirits have souls that seem to be bound to their partner and need light that they get by extending fairy like wings, similar to a battery recharging. There are different religions without the existence of the god Aldebaran and that makes one character question if their teachings are the right ones. This is all put into the bigger frame of "science", or - as the red haired girl says describes fittingly - "a method that tries to find the cause for things commonly attributed as god-made creations" (recalled from memory). The local mountain tribes betray the Imperium by murdering the leader of the supply expedition and some local cooperators and declare a holy war for […] that are kept prisoners in the main fort of the Imperium.

I am a bit skeptical about the following war. It is literally the perfect setup for a guerrila war, but the fightings are seemingly nothing else than a conventional one, the mountain tribes even posess big artillery.

Another thing "unrealistic" to me is that the chief of the fort keeps the spirits of the mountain tribe captive. This is seen as a blunder by the show (expressed through the protagonist), I however see this a good move. The mountain tribes are very simple people, the only thing holy to them are the spirits. As the mountain people are also prone to rebel or be unruly this seems like the perfect bargain, keeping the things they treasure the most as captives forcing them to comply. I must admit that this may only work as a complimentary measure, that is improving relations with them by e.g. giving them more autonomy or integrating them otherwise and this seems not the case here as the commanders seems to have ill intention and hate for the mountain people.

Episode 8 - Someday, for the Third Time

The onset of the punitive (?) expedition against the mountain people in the holy war they declared. The whole group delivers supplies closer to the front line. On arrival they first fight back an enemy night attack and then get ordered to move the supplies they brought with them to another fort even closer to the front lines. After a short march they discover that their goal is occupied by the enemy. The protagonist captures the fort trough the use of a new weapon technology, giving bullets a spin to increase their accuracy. After a brief moment in the newly captured fort, a soldier form the front lines makes report about how an army got surrounded after they entered an seemingly abandoned fort (it was a trap). Once again, the protagonist takes the initiative and moves with his and a few of his friends platoons to release the siege. He makes camp for two days on the way to acclimate the troops to the higher altitudes, on arrival they realize their comrades are all dead.

Episode 9 - The Fate of a Small Honor

They now arrive at the very front lines (keep in mind they are still cadets), right before the approach plan of the army is set into motion. They will split into three and assault their target (the main village it seems like) through 3 passes. While the main line approaches, they get ambushed in the mountains, the leader of the mountain people and a third party (previously seen helping the mountain people in with the new air rifles in use) try to kill the commander but get rebuked. The episode ends with the village center on fire.

Episode 10

The leader of mountain people rushes into the burning village and gets captured, the holy nation of Aldemanin decides to use reports of spirit abuse as a pretense to stage an invasion. They "descend the stairs of god" and enter the mountains with their army that seemingly only consists of cavalry. The make camp at "the great forrest of (…)" that is nothing more than trees in a huge mountain crater. The army of the empire decides to retreat and leave back a unit to harass the advancing army. They buy time to retreat by setting the forrest on fire, countered by the advancing army by setting fires themselves, removing fuel for the fire laid by the retreating army.

"The essence of a ghost lies in the fear that it may or may not be there. That fear paralyzes us, and prevents us from making bold moves."
