# Death Isn't Nothing - It's Less

What comes with life is death. What comes after death is nothing. Similar to how we sleep, the nothing isn't a sensation, it is the absence of anything. The word "nothing" implies the presence of an abstract concept, yet that nothing is the absence of a concept. It is plain non-existence.
