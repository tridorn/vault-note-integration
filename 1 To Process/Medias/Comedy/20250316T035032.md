# Are Students Ascetics?

I currently am reading on ascetics, as per my wider try of interpreting my life going forward (under the ascendance), I read about Anthony of the Desert, a particular individual attributed to be the first Father of the Desert and a trailblazer for all monks after him. After whom I took a look at Simeon Stylites, or "of the pillar", a man most well known to live in prayer on a pillar. He didn't immediately arrive at the conclusion of abandoning his earthly livings, he progressed from abbey (got evicted), over hut (nearly starved), to a small, narrow, convicted space of only 20 meters in diameter (!). A true trailblazer for all students after him.
