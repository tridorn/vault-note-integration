# In the Beginning of a Week

The start of every new week marks a slump in my progress and leads to anxiety that I'm suppressing via common escapisms available to me at that time.

Even in the times where weekly rhythms had theoretically no influence on how I spent my day (it was all the same, doing nothing), it was notable that I had an entirely more relaxed and laid-back air to me on the weekends, and felt anxiety during the start of the week.

In my plans of getting me out of that slump I have to take that factor into account. Despite my intention of treating every day the same, even weekends as workdays, there is the aforementioned sub-conscious influence that will lead me off the guard-rails if I'm not careful
