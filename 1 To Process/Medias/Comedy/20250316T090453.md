# Shadows of Desire Stirring

While I'm reinforcing the new personality of mine, remnants of the old me continue to peer through.

My new person, under the ascendance, feels like dark, brooding, ever-transforming clouds, embracing my mind, while the whims and desires of old beam like lances of gold through this dark mist. In my current state of mind I feel quite comfortable interpreting them for what they are, fragments of my old self, engrained in my brain through never-ending repetition until now. But, as seen before in the example of end of November 2024, a state of mind can change. I deem it thus necessary to one, constantly reinforce the new mind, and two, take things slow and deliberate. My history shows, that every time I built some momentum, had some hope for lasting change, that in quite short succession, these dreams were crushed by a return to old habits, typically facilitated by external factors like travels or events. All it takes is one day, one evening of intoxication, for the breakdown of any kind of order in the days succeeding.

The previous text is an output that you gave me at some point in a different conversation. I have many further notes on this topic, from the specific conversation, and from different conversations, which might have had different contexts, might have been written with much time in between, in different maturity stages, and with possibly different outcomes. I want to converge my notes on this topic by first reducing the notes in size, and then deriving insights from them. I need your help in this first step. Reduce the text in size, focus on retaining the core messages but reduce the bloat (don't cut too much, I want to retain some of the more unique tips). Assess rationally
On a side note, it is amusing, that the new personality, one of structure and rigour, is instinctually visualised as a foreboding, dark kind of concept, while the whimsical, entirely undisciplined part gets the heroical treatment of being clad in all gold, light beams, divine intervention, etc.
