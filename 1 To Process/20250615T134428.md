**Better formulation of your request:** _"Design a coherent, fully-integrated operating architecture that unifies temporal cadence, execution units, projects, and governance into a single system that scales from tactical work to multi-year initiatives."_
* * *

## 1. Temporal Cadence -- the clock

| Unit | Duration | Mandatory Governance Event | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Pulse** | 1 working day | Stand-up + end-of-day checkpoint | 
| **Sprint** | 10 consecutive working days | Sprint review + retrospective | 
| **Mission** | 6 -- 12 weeks (3-6 Sprints) | Mid-Mission health check | 
| **Program** | 6 months (2 Missions) | Program steering review | 
| **Campaign** | 12 months (2 Programs) | Quarterly portfolio review | 
| **Season** | Fiscal year | Annual strategic reset | 

_Every work item--no exception--carries a stamped Cadence Unit ID (`C25-S02-M01` for Campaign 25, Season 02, Mission 01)._

* * *

## 2. Structural Stack -- the org chart

| Layer | Purpose | Typical Size | Accountable Role | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Cell** | Single-discipline execution group | 3-5 FTE | _Cell Lead_ | 
| **Mission** | Cross-functional objective delivery | 2-4 Cells | _Mission Commander_ | 
| **Project** | Contractual scope: budget, deliverables, stakeholders. May consume one or multiple Missions. | Variable | _Project Owner_ | 
| **Program** | Thematic line of Projects that share KPIs | 2-4 Projects | _Program Director_ | 
| **Campaign** | Cohesive strategic thrust (e.g., market entry) | ≥1 Program | _Campaign Sponsor_ | 
| **Portfolio** | All active Campaigns within a Strategy Domain | Company-wide | _Strategic Command_ | 

**Key rule**: _Projects own scope and money; Missions own execution; Programs own learning; Campaigns own strategic narrative._

* * *

## 3. Binding Contracts -- how the layers talk

1. **Interface Standard**

    - _Input Spec_ → written in a single page ("Mission Order")

    - _Output Spec_ → validated acceptance criteria tied to Project scope

2. **RACI Snap-in**

    - **R**esponsible → Cell

    - **A**ccountable → Mission Commander

    - **C**onsulted → Project Owner

    - **I**nformed → Program Director

3. **Cadence ↔ Structure Mapping**

    - Every _Mission_ is fixed to one **Mission Cadence** window.

    - A _Project_ may straddle Mission windows but must close its financial period at the end of a **Program**.

    - _Campaign_ boundaries align to fiscal quarters to simplify reporting.
* * *

## 4. Governance Spine

1. **Strategic Command** -- sets annual Portfolio OKRs, allocates Campaign budgets.

2. **Program Board** -- monthly risk & dependency forum, greenlights Projects entering or exiting Programs.

3. **Mission Council** -- bi-weekly delivery forum; enforces interface standards.

4. **Cell Retro** -- sprint-level continuous improvement; feeds upward via Mission Commander.

Escalation moves **up** the spine; resources flow **down**.
* * *

## 5. Artefact Canon (minimum viable bureaucracy)

| Artefact | Owner | Frequency | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Mission Order (one-pager) | Mission Commander | At Mission launch | 
| Project Charter | Project Owner | At Project kick-off | 
| Sprint Log | Cell Lead | Daily | 
| Program Dashboard | Program Director | Monthly | 
| Campaign Scorecard | Campaign Sponsor | Quarterly | 
| Portfolio Review Deck | Strategic Command | Annual | 

Versioning rule → `YYMMDD_vN_<artefact-slug>.ext`. No artefact, no work.

* * *

## 6. Adoption Sequence

1. **Scaffold**: Generate repo template with folders matching the artefact canon.

2. **Pilot**: Run two simultaneous Missions under one Project; measure throughput, defect rate, coordination cost.

3. **Refine**: Tighten interfaces where friction manifests; do not relax specs.

4. **Roll-out**: Mandate the stack for all new Projects; sunset legacy schemes with a 90-day grace period.

* * *

### Net Effect

- _Clarity_: Single clock, single stack, explicit contracts.
- _Scalability_: Units can be added without inventing new terminology.
- _Command & Control_: Governance checkpoints are baked into cadence--no ad-hoc meetings.
- _Autonomy with Traceability_: Cells and Missions decide **how**; Projects decide **what**; Programs decide **why**; Campaigns decide **where next**.

Adopt this spine; anything looser breeds entropy, anything heavier suffocates velocity.
