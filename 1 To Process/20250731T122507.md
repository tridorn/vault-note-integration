**Correction.** Restate the request: _"Given that I have adopted the name 'Tristan Dornhelm,' should I also brand the institutional vehicle as 'Dornhelm,' and, if so, how should I structure both my personal presence and the institute's public façade?"_

### 1 Identity--Brand Convergence: Decision Logic

| Variable | Single-Name Architecture ("Dornhelm" = person + institute) | Differentiated Architecture ("Dornhelm Institute" + pseudonymous steward) | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Signal Strength** | High; one moniker accrues all mindshare. | Moderate; institute gains, steward stays obscure. | 
| **Perceived Legitimacy** | Ambiguous--risk of vanity project. | Stronger; institutional naming plus descriptor implies substance. | 
| **Liability Surface** | Maximal; legal, reputational, and ideological risks tied directly to you. | Bounded; institute shields individual, individual can pivot. | 
| **Transferability / Succession** | Weak; removal of founder imperils brand continuity. | Robust; institute persists, steward replaceable. | 
| **Narrative Control** | Total but brittle; dissent targets one locus. | Distributed; institute absorbs critique, steward can recalibrate. | 

**Verdict.** Unify the root term ("Dornhelm") for continuity, but append a functional qualifier to the institute. Keep yourself semi-visible as founding steward, not as sole persona behind every utterance.
* * *

### 2 Nominal Engineering

**Recommended construction:**  
`Dornhelm Governance Laboratory` OR `Dornhelm Systems Institute`

Criteria:

1. **Function before flourish.** The qualifier ("Laboratory," "Institute," "Works") telegraphs craft, not cult.

2. **Scalability.** Allows sub-units ("Dornhelm Research," "Dornhelm Ventures") without semantic drift.

3. **Search asymmetry.** Unique bigram "Dornhelm Governance" yields unambiguous SEO priority.

Avoid empty abstractions ("Center," "Foundation") unless you possess a legal foundation vehicle; precision signals seriousness.

### 3 Personal Positioning Protocol

1. **Legal dualism.** Incorporate the institute as a stand-alone entity (non-profit GmbH or Stiftung in your jurisdiction). You appear on filings as _Founder; Non-Executive Director_.

2. **Public rôle.** You publish _update letters_ and moderate salons; all conceptual papers list _Dornhelm Governance Laboratory_ as author.

3. **Voice segregation.**

    - Institute channels: formal, collective, third-person.

    - Personal channel (minimalist): operational notes, invitations, errata.

4. **Exit option.** Draft internal bylaws enabling a successor editorial board; your future disengagement does not decapitate the brand.

### 4 Operational Roadmap

| Quarter | Action | Metric of Adequacy | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Q0** | Secure `dornhelm.org` for institute; reserve `.com` as redirect. | Domain hierarchy finalised. | 
| **Q1** | Publish **Charter v1.0** and first three long-form essays under institute imprint. | Citation uptake by target thinkers. | 
| **Q2** | File incorporation; open restricted membership list (invite-only). | First 25 strategic subscribers. | 
| **Q3** | Host two closed salons; issue one policy brief to external journal. | External reference in at least one think-tank memo. |

### 5 Self--Institute Symbiosis: Guardrails

- **Do not** conflate personal social feeds with institute broadcasts; cross-link but never cross-post.
- **Do not** allow donors to route funds to you personally; all flows through the institute.
- **Do** maintain a private _founder's notebook_--offline or encrypted--to record reasoning you choose not to publish; this preserves optional intellectual property.
- **Do** rehearse succession annually; treat "Dornhelm" as an asset you might one day sell, spin off, or license.
* * *

### 6 Implications

- Brand unicity accelerates mindshare accumulation but heightens personal exposure; adding a functional suffix solves 80 % of that asymmetry.
- Legal separation plus controlled personal visibility preserves narrative authority while keeping your future manoeuvres unencumbered.
- Over time, the institute--not the individual--becomes the gravitational centre, enabling scale, partnerships, and eventual delegation.

**Conclusion.** Advance with a bifurcated construct: `Dornhelm [Functional Qualifier]` for the institutional body; _Tristan Dornhelm_ as discreet steward. Align channels accordingly, incorporate early, and architect succession now rather than later.
