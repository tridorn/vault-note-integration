Consider changing obsidian tags

## access

no longer used for archived or not
mainly public, private, restricted

consider creating a system where restricted is sub-divided into who has access to it. documenting through tag notes possibly (could be used for single persons, a range, a community, etc.)

## project

no longer /active or /completed
change to Drafts variant of pr/ and then the project id, e.g. pr/24260

## status

main marker of state the current note is in
e.g. /in-progress /in /out /cancelled /archived
