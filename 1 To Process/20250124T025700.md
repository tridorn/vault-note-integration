Your concern is quite valid, especially when operating with a small team where focusing all resources on one mission, like launching a new product, could result in other essential areas of the business being neglected. In a traditional company, certain **operational functions** need to continue running regardless of specific missions being executed. These include tasks like **customer support, financial management, administrative work, logistics**, and **IT infrastructure maintenance**—all of which keep the day-to-day operations of the company intact.

In the context of the **Adaptive Mission Unit (AMU)** structure, especially in a small team, this challenge can be addressed through a **dual-functioning approach** where employees may **straddle multiple roles**. Here’s a refined approach for ensuring that key operations aren’t neglected while working with a **limited workforce** in an AMU-driven structure.

### **1. Split Operational Functions and Mission-Based Work**

Even in a dynamic AMU structure, there are certain tasks that must be performed continuously for the company to function. To ensure that these essential operations are covered, you can create a **light-weight operational framework** outside the mission structure.

#### **Approach:**

- **AMUs for Mission-Based Work**: Reserve the AMUs for **project-based, time-bound missions** (e.g., product launches, market expansions). These missions have a clear start and end date, and they are high-priority, strategic initiatives.
- **Operational Support Functions**: Maintain a small **core operations team** (even if it’s just one or two people initially) to manage ongoing essential tasks like finance, customer support, logistics, and IT. In a small company, these functions can be **streamlined** to require minimal time and effort but still function consistently.

### **2. Cross-Functional Responsibilities for Small Teams**

When you have a small team, it's often necessary for individuals to take on **multiple roles** simultaneously. Employees within an AMU might have a **dual focus**:

- **Primary Role (Mission-Focused)**: They spend most of their time working within an AMU on a specific mission (e.g., launching the product).
- **Secondary Role (Operational Duties)**: They dedicate a portion of their time to **essential operational tasks**, such as managing finance, customer inquiries, or administrative tasks. This ensures that the company's core functions continue running smoothly in parallel to the mission-focused work.

#### **Example:**

- A **marketing specialist** in the AMU responsible for the product launch could spend 80% of their time focused on the mission (e.g., creating the go-to-market strategy, managing campaigns), but also handle **customer support** for 20% of their time, answering inquiries or resolving issues.
- A **software developer** working on the product launch may spend 90% of their time coding and testing the new product but also dedicate 10% to managing the company's **IT infrastructure** or responding to **technical support tickets**.

### **3. Simplified Operational Command Division for Small Teams**

In larger companies, the **Operational Command Divisions (OCDs)** are dedicated teams providing logistical, financial, technological, and administrative support. In a small company, you may not have the resources to build full-fledged OCDs, but you can streamline these roles.

#### **Approach For Small Teams:**

- **Automation and Outsourcing**: Use tools to **automate routine tasks** like accounting (e.g., QuickBooks or Xero), customer support (e.g., Zendesk or Freshdesk), or project management (e.g., Trello, Asana). This reduces the manual load on your team, allowing them to focus on their mission work.
- **Outsource When Necessary**: For tasks that are critical but not day-to-day (e.g., legal advice, HR compliance), outsourcing can help. For example, you might use an external accounting service for taxes and payroll or a legal firm to handle contracts.

#### Example

- Instead of hiring a full-time financial officer, use **bookkeeping software** to manage finances automatically, and rely on an external accountant for quarterly financial reviews.
- For customer support, consider using a **ticketing system** (like Freshdesk or Zendesk) to ensure queries are handled, even if one person checks and responds to them only once or twice a day.

### **4. Staggered Mission Assignments and Capacity Management**

Rather than focusing all efforts on one mission, stagger the workload across missions to ensure different operational needs are addressed without overloading employees.

#### **Approach:**

- **Mission Staggering**: While launching a new product might be your main mission, consider assigning smaller missions simultaneously to manage other aspects of the business. For example:
  - A smaller mission could be focused on **improving customer onboarding** or **optimizing the website**, with fewer people and shorter timelines.
  - These smaller missions can involve employees whose **primary operational duties** (e.g., finance, customer support) are less intensive.

#### Example

- While the **main AMU** is working on the product launch, another AMU could focus on ensuring **customer retention** or enhancing the **company’s technical infrastructure**. This could be a smaller, low-effort mission that ensures the company’s operational areas continue to be addressed without taking attention away from the main mission.

### **5. Periodic Operational Reviews for Realignment**

Given that AMUs are mission-based, they can sometimes focus so intensely on a mission that other parts of the business might be overlooked. A way to balance this is to have **periodic operational reviews** where the team takes a step back to review the **overall health of the company** beyond the mission.

#### **Approach:**

- **Monthly or bi-weekly operational reviews**: These are short, structured meetings where the team checks on the state of the company’s **operational health**:
  - Are customers being supported?
  - Are financials in order?
  - Is IT infrastructure working properly?
  - Are there any backlogs in the logistics chain?
- This gives you a chance to address operational blind spots without taking too much time away from the mission.

### **6. Cross-AMU Resource Sharing**

As your company grows and you develop more AMUs, you can leverage **cross-AMU collaboration** to spread operational duties across different teams. This would ensure that no single AMU is burdened with all the operational work, and various missions are supported.

#### **Approach:**

- **Cross-functional team members**: One AMU can support another in areas where there is expertise or excess capacity. For example, while one AMU is launching a new product, another AMU focused on **market research** could handle tasks like **customer segmentation** for the new product launch without overlapping efforts.

### **Conclusion: Balance Mission-Focused Work and Operational Necessities**

In smaller companies with limited resources, balancing mission-focused work (through AMUs) and day-to-day operations is essential to keep the company functioning while driving growth. By **assigning cross-functional responsibilities**, automating and outsourcing where possible, and **staggering missions**, you can ensure that the company’s core operational needs are met while remaining agile and focused on mission-based execution.

This structure allows you to:

- **Stay focused on high-priority missions** like product launches or market expansions.
- Ensure **essential operations** (finance, customer support, logistics) are not neglected.
- Maintain flexibility and agility even with a small team, allowing your company to grow efficiently.
