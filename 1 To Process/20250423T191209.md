*Correction: a clearer request might have been, “Please expand the ACM assignment taxonomy to account for **freelancers, contractors, partner agencies, and other external parties** so that their integration is as fluid as that of internal staff.”*

## I.  Why “externals” deserve their own rubric  

The AMU chassis was conceived for **heterogeneous resource assemblages**—internal or external.  
What was previously missing is not *capacity* but *nomenclature.*  To repair that lacuna I add three explicit attachment classes—**Embedded Contractor, Fractional Specialist, and Partner-AMU**—each tuned to the contractual, fiduciary, and IP realities of outsiders.

## II.  Extended ACM Assignment Taxonomy (incl. externals)  

| **Assignment Class** | **Typical Source** | **Canonical Purpose** | **Authority & Voting** | **Tenure Modality** | **Primary Contract Instrument** | **Reporting Line** |
|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Core Membership** | Internal FTEs | Mission command / execution | Full | Mission-bounded | Employment contract | AMU Leader → LFO |
| **Rotational Duty** | Internal FTEs | Cross-pollination, dev-track | Full (during stint) | 1–3 sprints | Internal MoU | Dual (domain mgr + AMU) |
| **Flash Attachment** | Internal FTEs | Crisis fix ≤ 72 h | Tactical | Hour-to-hour | Verbal order / ticket | AMU Leader |
| **Advisory Attachment** | Int. or Ext. | Non-binding counsel | None | Episodic | Consulting SOW | Node Head / AGS |
| **Liaison** | Int. or Ext. | Bi-directional info flow | Procedural | As needed | NDA + liaison charter | Dual nodes |
| **Embedded Contractor** ***NEW*** | External freelancer / gig platform | Hands-on gap-filling (design, code, copy) | Operational *inside* AMU | ≤ mission | Independent-contractor agreement + IP assignment | AMU Leader (functional) / Finance-OCD (commercial) |
| **Fractional Specialist** ***NEW*** | External fractional exec, auditor, DPO | Provides C-level or regulatory expertise part-time | Advisory + veto on domain-risk | Retainer cadence (e.g., 1 day/week, 6 mo) | Retainer contract | Domain Chief (e.g., CFO) / LC |
| **Partner-AMU** ***NEW*** | External agency / vendor team | Deliver an entire sub-mission *as a black-box AMU* | Autonomous on tactics; bound on KRs | Contract-defined | Master Services Agreement + SOW with AMU KPIs | Task-Force Leader ↔ Vendor PM |
| **Embedded Service** | Int. OCD staff | Sustainable support | Operational | %-time for mission | Internal SLA | Functional mgr / AMU |
| **Secretariat / EA** | Int. FTE | Admin nerve for execs | None (scope-defined) | Indef. | Employment | Exec principal |
| **Apprenticeship** | Interns, graduates | Skill acquisition | Observational | 3–6 mo | Internship agreement | Mentor |
| **Audit / Compliance** | Int. or Ext. | Independent oversight | Investigative | Cyclic / ad-hoc | Audit mandate | Board / Compliance chair |

### Key differentiators for externals  

|                       | Embedded Contractor | Fractional Specialist | Partner-AMU |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Billing**           | Hourly / per-sprint | Monthly retainer | Milestone-based |
| **IP transfer**       | Immediate, work-made-for-hire | Defined scope | Per SOW |
| **Security on-board** | Fast-track NDA, least-privilege creds | Elevated but limited | Segmented VPN / test data |
| **Tool access**       | Project repo, Slack channel | Exec dashboards | API sandbox, limited prod |
| **Exit**              | Mission closure or 7-day notice | 30-day off-ramp | Delivery + knowledge-transfer clause |

---

## III.  On-boarding funnel for externals  

```
Need Identified  →  AGS Resource Gate  →  Contract & NDA
                 ↘  Talent Pool DB     ↘  Security & Compliance Briefing
                  ↘  OCD-Finance PO     ↘  Tool Provisioning
                       ↓                       ↓
           AMU Kick-off (or Task-Force vendor sync)
```

*The AGS authorises spend; OCD-Legal drafts; OCD-IT issues credentials; Finance-OCD tracks burn; AMU Leader directs day-to-day.*

## IV.  Example micro-scenarios  

1. **Side-hustle AMU needs Figma wizard for two days**  
   - **Class:** Embedded Contractor  
   - **Process:** 48-h PO → NDA → Figma access → deliver assets → off-boarding checklist.

2. **Series-A fund-raise AMU lacks CFO horsepower**  
   - **Class:** Fractional Specialist (part-time CFO)  
   - **Authority:** Advises on valuation, can veto non-GAAP antics; no daily sprint rights.

3. **Growth Task-Force outsources TikTok ads**  
   - **Class:** Partner-AMU (external agency supplies a pod)  
   - **KRs:** CAC < $2.50, 5 k leads/month; integrated stand-ups weekly with internal Growth AMU.

---

## V.  Governance & Risk Controls  

1. **Confidentiality & IP** → Strong NDAs + work-made-for-hire in all external contracts.  
2. **Access Hygiene** → Zero-trust onboarding: least-privilege accounts, time-boxed tokens, immediate revocation on exit.  
3. **Quality Gates** → Sprint-end demos, code reviews, and KPI dashboards visible to AGS + LFO.  
4. **Regulatory Alignment** → Fractional DPO / CISO attachments in high-compliance environments (GDPR, HIPAA).

## VI.  Litmus: When to externalise vs. internalise?  

Apply the **“MAKE-BUY-BORROW triad”**:

| Criterion           | Internal AMU | Embedded Contractor | Partner-AMU |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Strategic core?** | Yes          | No                  | Maybe (if scale) |
| **Speed critical?** | Medium       | High                | High |
| **Skill rarity?**   | Buildable    | Rare but niche      | Complex & composite |
| **Budget flexibility?** | Fixed salary | Variable hourly | Milestone lumpsum |

Choose the lightest model that satisfies mission velocity without jeopardising core IP or culture.

### Final dictum  

> **“Structure must be taut enough for coherence, supple enough for ingenuity.”**  
> In the ACM that suppleness is supplied by **external attachments**—contractors, fractional experts, and whole partner-pods—integrated through crisp assignment classes that keep sovereignty, security, and speed in harmonious tension.
