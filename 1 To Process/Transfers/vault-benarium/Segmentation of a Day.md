# Segmentation of a Day

---

## Introduction

Segmentation of a day splits the day into multiple sessions for a general structure. These aren't immovable objects, they are more there to better understand how a typical day looks like and to get a better overview of the day by splitting him into smaller sections.

---

## General Segmentation

My day can be loosely separated into free time to do whatever and necessary administrative time. Free to do whatever doesn't mean unplanned time or refers to actions purely based on instincts or urges, it rather means that this time is freely plannable and not obstructed by things that *have* to be done. This second group of tasks are things like sleep and eating, but also includes sports and even commute time.

Based on the sectors of time that have to be allocated, even to that very specific time every day, there arise 4 main blocks of freely assignable time, each 4 hours long. This essentially means there are 8 hours in the day that are occupied by things that are absolutely necessary[^1] with 16 hours of the day being available for assignments of higher order. While this could theoretically mean 16 hours of immensely difficult tasks, first, the [[Time Plan System]] with its half-an hour [[Time Frames]] is designed to create interruption and moments of mindfulness [[Categorise and Review and Adjust and Plan & Mindfulness|more details]]), second this time should be, based on experiences and data from the [[Data System]], allocated to tasks of higher order, of lower order, and even pauses, in an optimal way, best analysed in the very moment.

## 03:00-07:00

**Freely assignable time**

In my personal experience do these very early morning hours represent some of the most special hours in the whole day. As I come fresh out of sleep, my mind is at its clearest and because there essentially are no distractions with the surrounding world still asleep, they can be some of the most productive. They can even feel immensely serene, and happy, beyond simply being productive hours.

### 03:00-03:30

Start of the day.

The very first half an hour is generally spent on waking up and getting up. The more in-depth workflow can be found in [[Start of the Day]]. It mainly consists of revitalising the body and meditation.

First meal of the day, some bread with butter and ham, juice, and a hard egg.

### 03:30-04:00

### 04:00-04:30

### 04:30-05:00

### 05:00-05:30

There is a regular slump in energy from around 05:00 onwards.

### 05:30-06:00

### 06:00-06:30

The last hour from 06:00 is once again quite energy driven.

### 06:30-07:00

---

## 07:00-09:00

*Blocked administrative time*

### 07:00-07:30

Nap 1 from 07:05 to 07:25.

### 07:30-08:00

Workout 1 is from 07:30 to 08:30. It should best be done outside to experience the early golden morning, get some fresh air already and have a wider range of equipment for calisthenic routines.

### 08:00-08:30

It is important to wrap up the workout fast, get home, take protein and shower (cold).

### 08:30-09:00

In this half an hour time frame I eat a small meal to bridge to lunch and then travel to my place of work (university currently). I should arrive before 09:00

---

## 09:00-13:00

**Freely assignable time**

This time should be spent somewhere away from home at my "place of work". This currently means the university. Over there, I work on some stuff that is still high profile in terms of mental demand, even tho the productivity can generally be assessed lower than in the early morning session.

This is probably my least favourite time in the day.

### 09:00-09:30

### 09:30-10:00

### 10:00-10:30

### 10:30-11:00

### 11:00-11:30

### 11:30-12:00

### 12:00-12:30

### 12:30-13:00

In the last time frame I have to set things in place to be able to get home as soon as possible after.

---

## 13:00-14:00

*Blocked administrative time*

### 13:00-13:30

This time is spent on commuting home and eating lunch. I need to be home for the next big time block of freely assignable that is spent on forex day trading and I need my computer setup. It makes Nap 2 easier, too, as I don't have to search for a place to sleep away from home.

### 13:30-14:00

Nap from 13:35-13:55.

---

## 14:00-18:00

**Freely assignable time**

The designation as freely assignable gives an illusion of choice, as currently this time is assigned to Forex day trading only.

### 14:00-14:30

### 14:30-15:00

### 15:00-15:30

### 15:30-16:00

The main market session is from 15:30 onwards. There the New York Stock exchange opens its gates and the american trading session starts and as this time overlaps with the London session it creates the biggest movements of the day, generally.

### 16:00-16:30

### 16:30-17:00

### 17:00-17:30

### 17:30-18:00

---

## 18:00-18:30

*Blocked administrative time*

### 18:00-18:30

This time slot is for eating dinner and also for commute time to a possible destination for the next time slot.

---

## 18:30-22:30

**Freely assignable time**

This time slot is quite variable. It has a standard layout which can be omitted if there are evening events, conferences or any other social attendances. These should be sought out as frequent as possible in the context of creating and strengthening a network.

### 18:30-19:00

Workout 2 is from 18:30 to 19:30

### 19:00-19:30

### 19:30-20:00

### 20:00-20:30

### 20:30-21:00

### 21:00-21:30

### 21:30-22:00

End of the day.

The penultimate time frame tries sort out the left overs of the day and tie lose ends together. It sets the stage for the very last time frame. Check [[End of the Day]] for the detailed workflow.

### 22:00-22:30

Conclusion of the day.

The last time frame is occupied by the daily [[Categorise, Review, Adjust, Plan & Mindfulness|CRAP&M].

---

## 22:30-03:00

*Blocked administrative time*

These 4 hours 30 minutes can not under any circumstances be used for anything other than sleep. This is my core sleep and probably the most important factor in my day.

### 22:30-23:00

### 23:00-23:30

### 23:30-24:00

### 00:00-00:30

### 00:30-01:00

### 01:00-01:30

### 01:30-02:00

### 02:00-02:30

### 02:30-03:00

---

## Conclusion

While the [[Time Plan System]] allows for a flexible and agile planning of the day, some areas can still be identified as staying generally the same. Other factors like the [[Special Plan System]] also play a role in finding optimised workflows or assign demands to regulate a rule based approach to life.

The general time blocks are:

- **03:00-07:00**
- *07:00-09:00*
- **09:00-13:00**
- *13:00-14:00*
- **14:00-18:00**
- *18:00-18:30*
- **18:30-22:30**
- *22:30-03:00*

[^1]: Regarding commute time as "absolutely necessary": I included it in the group (it is called administrative time after all) because it is more elegant to have it out of the way of the freely assignable time. I can also bundle it together with eating what saves and condenses time.
