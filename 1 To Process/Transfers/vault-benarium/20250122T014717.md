## Overview

This project was intended to set up the multi-purpose business of Ben Dyk, partly focused on education, fashion, and best practices, potentially delving into venture capital, consulting, and other innovative solutions.

However, it has laid dormant starting quite literally the second after I copied all of the ChatGPT text (which I never processed at that) and thus I decided to abandon this standalone project in favour of a unified approach via PR25083.
