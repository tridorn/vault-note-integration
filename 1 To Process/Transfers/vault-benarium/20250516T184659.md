## Overview

Corpus Principia is a framework to rationally assess any kind of institution under a select few quintessential lenses.

Its mandate was first formulated in the [[20250511T203153|Corpus Principia White-paper]].

At its core does corpus principia dissect every kind of entity in an institution into nodes and edges. The minimal number is 1, for the entire institution, depth and breadth can be configured freely and on-demand.

Major constituents of corpus principia are: [[20250516T185359|3 Structural Axes]], and [[20250516T191001|12 Functional Clusters]].

3. Initiative
representing body of codified knowledge and direction, structure, action, respectively.

## 12 Functional Clusters
