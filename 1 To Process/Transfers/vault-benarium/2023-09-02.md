# 2023-09-02

Today was spent moving from Lucca to Firenze first thing in the morning (right after a luscious breakfast of course). We had everything sorted out by about 14:00 and moved to the city center via Tram. The rest of the day was spent exploring the city, mainly the river and Forte di Belvedere.  
There are some more things of interest, especially regarding the status of the various systems, but my time runs to short to address them. My alarm is set for the regular time (03:00), I have to hope I follow through and really get up. The last days were not really exhausting but so much physical activity, or rather in intensity out of the order of every day leads inevitably to more need for recovery.
