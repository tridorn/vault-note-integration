# Vacation Italy 2023

## Introduction

The vacation stretched from the end of October to the start of September and lead us through a not negligible part of the awe-inspiring historic landscapes of Italy. Together with [[2024-03-22-16-04-46|Andreas Jendyk]] I travelled for 2 weeks in what can be seen as a road trip from Gevelsberg over Locarno, over Verona (via Como and Bergamo), over Lucca (via Parma, + Pisa and Livorno), over Florence, over Rome (via Siena), over Assisi, to Munich.
