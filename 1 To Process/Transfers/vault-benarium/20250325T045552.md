# Summary of 2025-03-25

---

## Overview

---

## 18:00 To 24:00

Laid down, as I was genuinely unable to stay awake and slept all the way through midnight

---

## 24:00 To 06:00

Ate some noodles, drank some water enhanced with Waterdrop energy drink (Shiro), and mostly read in the Dungeon of Black Company manga.

---

## 06:00 To 07:30

Turned my attention to the previously left off topic of starting some small business ventures fast, mostly scanned the ChatGPT conversation and wrote a small plan for today.

---

## 07:30 To 09:00

Did my workout, first day of leg training.

---

## 09:00 To 13:00

Mostly worked on setting up my personal brand and Eupator, things like claiming social media handles. Not as productive as hoped, but progress nonetheless.

---

## 13:00 To 14:00

Midday break. I ate with chicken. Laid down for nap, but didn't fall asleep

---

## 14:00 To 18:30

Worked on the Innolab issue, developed it from a more standalone-bank approach to a more focused one, essentially brokering green loans to SMEs.

## 18:30 To 21:30

I drove into Mannheim for the Innolab, I prepared todays's task beforehand (filling a fish diagram, or root-cause analysis) so I didn't really do much when there. Arrive home again at around 21:00 and didn't do much after. Went to bed at around 21:30 as very tired.
