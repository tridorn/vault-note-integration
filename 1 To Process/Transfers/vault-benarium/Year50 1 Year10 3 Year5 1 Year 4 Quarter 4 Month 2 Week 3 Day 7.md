## Events of the Time Frame

I stayed up until 03:00 and originally planned to sleep until 07:00 but overslept until about 10:00

The time from 10:00 until 13:00 is largely unclear, I ate breakfast (bread with an egg) and finished the book Kinder der Zeit by Adrian Tchaikovsky.

From 13:00 on I started applying the [[Time Plan System]] and noted some of the content of the time frames. I ate lunch from 13:00 to 13:30 and succesfully did Nap 2 from 13:35 to 13:55 (even tho I didn't fall asleep). I wanted to conclude the [[Review Questions]] of the [[Data System]] as soon as possible after, this took me way longer than expected tho, I worked together with Chat GPT to up until 16:00.

The time until 18:00 then, once again, is unclear.

I did my workout from 18:00 to about 19:00, ate dinner up until 20:00 and rode my bike around Munich until 21:00.

Then I worked on [[End of the Day]] and [[Categorise and Review and Adjust and Plan & Mindfulness|Conclusion of the Day]].

## Conclusion

While not entirely successful, it had its good moments and was the first step in the process of the establishment of a routine.
