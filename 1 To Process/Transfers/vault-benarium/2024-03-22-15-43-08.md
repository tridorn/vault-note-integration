# AI Effect

"AI is everything that has not been done yet".

"People are subconsciously trying to preserve themselves some special role in the universe."

"[â€¦] When we know how a machine does something 'intelligent', it ceases to be regarded as intelligent."

People cease to see problems solves by AI as in the domain of AI. Some people perceive it more an automaton than actual intelligence.

-> In the movie of Google to their Go AI is one researcher unimpressed that it's just a program while the Koreans hold Go in such high, inherently artful human regard
