## Language Learning

I plan on learning French. The daily time slot dedicated is from 05:00 to 06:00.

Behavioural change is related to a specific kind of change - to become more stately. From speech practice over leadership to quick-thinking, every single day of the week has a different sector. The time slot is 06:00 to 07:00

## Trading

I plan on actively trading every single week day. The time slot for day trading is 14:00 to 18:00, and for swing trading is 18:30 to 20:00. Besides active trading is increasing my knowledge and abilities. The main focus of weekends is to prepare for the week ahead, as well as increasing my abilities.

## Startup

Similar to the analysis, I also plan on drafting a new startup every single day, using a template to fill in the blanks for its specific case. The purpose is to get used to the initiation process.
