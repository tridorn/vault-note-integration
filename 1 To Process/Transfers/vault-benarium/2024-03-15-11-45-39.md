# Swap Crypto without Gas

#a/rL

You don't need any bridge or any gas.

Buy SOL from an exchange. Send it to your wallet. Phantom. Then connect to raydium, orca, or Jupiter. And there you will swap or buy.

When you look up the coin on coin marketcap, scroll down to see where you can get it. You will probably want to pick the location with the highest liquidity and volume. As that will be your best chance at the bear price and least impact and slippage. However, liquidity is really good just about everywhere for most coins

Raydium is personally my favorite SOL dex.
