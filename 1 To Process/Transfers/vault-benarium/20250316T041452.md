# The Downfall of an Apple

An amusing tale I couldn't help but write about, is the story of how a huge apple gifted to an emperor lead to the the execution of one of his life-long friends and the banishment of his wife.

As told by the sixth-century historian John Malalas of Antioch, emperor Theodosius II while walking through the streets of Constantinople was presented with a huge apple "beyond exaggeration" by a man passing by. The emperor thanked the man, gave him some money, and sent the apple to his wife, Eudocia, as a present. She decided to give it to a mutual friend of theirs, Paulinus. He on the other hand decided that such an enormous apple was only worthy of the emperor, and gifted it to Theodosius II in turn.
Now confused, Theodosius II asked his wife what she did to the apple, to which she replied "I ate it".
Now suspicious, he asked her to confirm this statement under oath, which she did ("I swear I ate it").
Now enraged, he ordered the execution of Paulinus, and the banishment of Eudocia to Jerusalem, suspecting a secret affair between the two.

The above is the fun version of the story (of the downfall of Eudocia), while in a different telling Eudocia just committed some petty murder.
