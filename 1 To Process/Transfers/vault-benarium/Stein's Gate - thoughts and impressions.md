# Stein's Gate - Thoughts and Impressions

#todo/reform  
Episode 1

- "The universe has a start but no end"
- First episode is titled "Prologue to the start and end"  
-> How can there be a prologue to the end if there is no end?
- First scene probably explain the very end of the series
- red haired girl mention of protagonis talking to her 15 ago prob time travel
- guy posting of time travel theories maybe protagonist anom
- male scream, red haired girl on the floor dead?
- use his message to date back time jumps
- black haired girl weird, instinctively I would say she is not what it seems like but how the story is presented she prob is not truly surprising (going against her design)
- the way the black hair girl introduces herself has mantra like form, prob going to be used to unterscheid reality from some kind of unreality
- organization presented as delusion but prob with some substance
- encounter with black hair girl saying "The organization has finally made its move", time jump protago like when talking to red haired girl
- STeins Gate prob reference to Einstein-Rosenfeld holes (? or similarly named)
- Reoccuring themes (like Dr Pepper and the introduction of black haired girl) prob of some relevance for time jumps (loops)
- Future red haired girl might have been killed there (not current one), maybe she was even a bad guy (split on that)

Episode 2

Well, just discovered red haired girl is right in the middle of the title cover (?), even more centered than the protagonist. Numbers, arranged like bits in hacker movies come from her backside similar to a cape. She seems to be a central component around whom things resolve. Purely by analyzing the picture further one can also see that in fact there seems to be some kind of organized organization (seemingly the bad guys) and an abundance of female characters with one male character who poses no rivalry to our protagonist at all, amusing. As I watched the first few episodes of Elfen Lied a short time ago, purely based on her character design in this picture would make me think she is some kind of android or somehow developed different (on a biological level) that makes her a central to the story. Might even relate to the time jumps/loops. Maybe she developed the math, or is the only one capable of doing the math (unlikely). One has to think of what exactly the desire of the organization is and it probably is something that the red haired girl possesses. She is setup to be a love interest of the protagonist, I do not think this show dives too deep into that, tho, the characters are too unique in their design for this to be a flattened romance story (this does not mean that this show might me completely absent of it).  
Looking at the Episode titles moving forward also does not yield too much, there seem to be connections between episodes, based on their namings (like multiple episodes having the words Necrosis next to another descriptor in their title), most likely subplots.

- the press conference of the prof (about a time machine) was called of after what hacker said. This might be in conflict what we saw, in turn indicating a change of events derived from a change of the time line. When exactly this change was is unclear, also how the message that the protagonist send of the stabbing of the red girl (which got split in three and sent to the past) plays into this.
- I forgot to mention: A satellite? Crashing into a building? ðŸ¤¨ And leaving only a slight dent? ðŸ¤¨ Without even showing sign of any atmospheric burns? ðŸ¤¨ This thing - if truly a satellite with that much volume left on impact - would have absolutely obliterated the building and the next few hundred meters, like removed from existence
- One thing that just occurred to me is that the red haired girl that got killed was the current one, then a time jump happened and somehow a lot of the things like presentation did not occur (thus keeping the red haired girl alive). This still leaves the question open about the messages sent to the past and why the time jump seemingly occured after the presentation finished (when he clicked send on the stabbing message). Red haired girl definitely of vital importance to the story. This also introduces a paradoxon where the red haired girl got killed, someone jumped back in time to save her but she seem vital to time travel at all so that time travel might not even happen without her. How would someone be able to jump back in time tho if she got killed to hinder death?
- Organization seems to be a future corp named SERN that monopolizes time machines. A typical corporate dystopia
- Grandfather paradox. If your grandkid would time travel back and kill you that would create two timelines, one in which you live and one in which you die. What happens to the grandkid?
- Titor seemingly a time traveler from the future, removed from the current time line
- Another motfi gel banana (or fruit in general?)
- Maybe it actually is the protagonist in an alternative timeline that created SERN (!). + wants to change the rling structure + would make for a good twist, the organization he fights is the one he created + in an alternative timeline, in other words the future is not set into stone (get it) and maybe different futures try to influence the current timeline.
- He prob switched to a different timeline when he sent the text of the stabbing of the red haired girl (see grandfather paradoc)
- Seems like protagonist builds base for time travel and red haired girl irons out

Episode 3

- red haired girl seems in fact to be setup to be the love interest of the protagonist
- phone of hacker connected to microwave when the mesage of the stabbing of the red haired was sent by the protagonist
- at some point in the future there are prob going to pop up messages seemingly without context or reason that come being sent into the past. I wonder tho, it seems like we are experiencing everything through the lense of the protagonist (every split of the time line) but these messages are probably sent into a branching time line. That means that prob we are not going to get these messages
- Well, SERN seems to be CERN ðŸ’€ The research institution seems to have developed into a megacorp
- brown haired girl sus on first view but prob only a setup
- when i see black haired girl in certain scenes, all alarm bells in my head start to ring. There is something off about her beyond her character design

Episode 4

- I forgot to mention: The sun/stars seem to also be a reocurring them
- IBN 5100 got donated 10 years ago, donor said "sometime a young man is going to appear who needs it". Well that is kind of an obvious hint is it not? Most likely it is protagonist himself that donated it in a time jump

Episode 5

- Brown haired girl acted hostile against red haired girl. It was a pretty spontaneous reaction, like to someone that you hate your whole life and then meet on chance. She was kind of sus from the start from how much she knows.  
- Brown haired girl said she once knew someone who knew a lot about IBN's. He seemingly died long ago. She also warned protagonist about red haired girl, she knows nothing yet but protagonist should be wary of her going forward ("in the future"). *The man sh knew who died long ago might just have been future protagonist or future hacker*, she herself ist most definitely from the future. She also jumped when a helicopter flew over them, reinforcing my thesis of some trauma in her. She also does not know fireworks

Episode 6

- Messages sent to the past now called D-Mail. Not sure why they are relevant fort he time travel at all (it seems like it). Why are the messages split into multiple parts?
- Brown haired girl said she got nothing to do with red haired girl "in the past".
- "Eternity isn't infinity, even if time appears to extend toward eternity, there is still an end."
- We are indeed following the timeline of the protagonist
- brown haired girl holds something in her hand, maybe a compass but definitely a memorandum of the future.
- divergence number changes when you change something of the past. World moves to an alternative reality
- Divergence 1%? Seems to be a central point

Episode 7
