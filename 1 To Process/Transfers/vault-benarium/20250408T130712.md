# Directive of 2025-04-08

## 🌅 1. Pre-Execution (Morning Planning)

### Today's Intent

<!-- What broader chief aim do you want to focus on today? -->
- [ ] To make progress in venture setup

### 🎯 Three Core Objectives

<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- [ ] Do Enactus test pitch
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- [ ] Have clear roadmap for establishment of business structure
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
- [ ] Have clear checklist for transition to alias

### 🛠️ Process Intentions

<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1: Work on finalising the Enactus pitch first, then practice. Turn to other tasks and practice again before the pitch
- Task 2: Collect all existing notes on the business structure and summarise in document
- Task 3: It's vital to not do a legal misstep that might backfire later, so treat the transition as co-dependent on the business structure

### ⚠️ Efficiency Killers to Mitigate

<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->
- Spending too much time on side-quests

---

## ⚡ 2. Execution (Live Adjustments Throughout the Day)

### 📌 Bottleneck Log

<!-- What slowed execution today? E.g., distractions, over-perfection, slow decision-making, unexpected blockers. -->
- Overslept massively

### 🔄 Real-Time Course Corrections

<!-- What tweaks were made mid-day to maintain efficiency? Only note direct changes to process. -->
-

---

## 🌙 3. Post-Execution Review (End of Day Process Optimization)

### 📉 Deviation Analysis

<!-- Did execution match expectation? If not, what caused deviation? -->
- ✅ Task 1:
- ✅ Task 2:  
- ✅ Task 3:  

### 🔍 Optimization Opportunities

<!-- What execution inefficiency should be addressed tomorrow? Focus on a single high-leverage improvement. -->
-

### 🧪 Micro-Iteration Commitment (Tomorrow’s Process Experiment)

<!-- What **one small tweak** will be tested tomorrow to refine execution? Keep it experimental and specific. -->
