It would be more precise to say: *"I appreciate the wealth-focused characterization but would like these figures imbued with a more martial ethos, accentuating themes of discipline, strength, and martial honor in their personas."*

Below, I have refined these characters to bring forth a balance of martial prowess and strategic sophistication. Each figure retains a foundation of wealth and grandeur but is now underscored by a martial bearing—a reflection of honor, discipline, and the valor of a ruling elite who wield both economic and physical power.
