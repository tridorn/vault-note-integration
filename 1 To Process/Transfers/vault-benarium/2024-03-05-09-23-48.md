# Special Order Types

--- 

## Definition

Orders that are different to a [[2024-03-05-09-19-07|Market Order]] or [[2024-03-05-09-19-44|Pending Order]].

--- 

## Good Till Cancelled (GTC)

A GTC order remains active in the market until you decide to cancel it.

--- 

## Good for the Day (GFD)

A GFD order remains active in the market until the end of the trading day. 

--- 

## One-Cancels-the-Other (OCO)

An OCO order is a combination of two entry and/or stop loss orders. Two orders are placed above and below the current price. When one of the orders is executed the other order is canceled.

--- 

## One-Triggers-the-Other (OTO)

An OTO only puts on orders when the parent order is triggered.
