## Definition

A spinning top is a [[2024-03-08-13-38-08|Candlestick Pattern]] that has a small box and a long upper and lower shadow.

## Spinning Top Indicates Battle Between Buyers and Sellers

The color of the box is not relevant, what matters is the small box indicating little price movement between opening and closing and the long shadows on *both* ends symbolizing great price movement during the time (but before close). It essentially colors a battle between buyers and sellers with no side emerging victorious.

## Spinning Top Could Hint at a Reversal

In a downtrend a spinning top can mean that there are not many sellers left and a reversal could happen and vice versa (in an uptrend with buyers).
