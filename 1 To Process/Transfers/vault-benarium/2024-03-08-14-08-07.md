## How to Do

When trading the Bounce you want to verify that the price really is rebounding from the resistance or support levels. This is why you set your [[2024-03-05-09-19-44|Pending Order]] slightly above the support (limit buy) and below the resistance (limit sell). Your [[2024-03-05-09-25-20|Stop Loss Order]] is placed beyond the support or resistance.
