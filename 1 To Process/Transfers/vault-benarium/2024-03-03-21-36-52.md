## What Main Forex Trading Sessions Are There?

Even tho the Forex market is open 24 hours, liquidity is not alway high, that is why there are a few main trading sessions, named after cities:

- Sydney session
- Tokyo session
- London session
- New York session  

Historically, forex traders follow a 3 session trading system, Asian (Tokyo), European (London), and North American (New York).
