# Schopenhauer's Misanthropy

Currently diligently skimming the Wikipedia article on Arthur Schopenhauer, and the more I read on the fella, the less he seems like a likeable and agreeable person. He is constantly warring every person he comes across, his preferred medium is critic in literary format, leading to frequent quarrels when meeting the assorted person in person, and despite that, he still sees *other* people as the evil? While he seems to have had a love life (a life of affairs), different to modern "incels", and despite his appearances, I can't help but draw comparisons. He seems to have been an entirely unpleasant person to be around, despite his intellect. I can only think of that he applied "it takes one to know one" to every person around him, presuming everybody is the same his him.
