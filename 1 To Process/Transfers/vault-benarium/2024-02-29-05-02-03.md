## What Forex Brokers Really Are

You are not trading the underlying [[2024-02-29-04-46-15|currency]] but make bets with a counterparty (the "broker") about which direction the price is going to move. It is important to make sure that your broker is able to pay out if you made a winning trade. You also have to make sure the [[2024-02-28-14-51-33|quoted prices are fair]] and [[2024-03-03-21-50-03|Slippage]] is as low as possible.[^2]

## How to Choose A Good Forex Broker

Historically, the [[2024-02-28-15-22-52|Forex]] industry has suffered from a lack of regulation and oversight. It is important to verify the integrity of the company you chose, as you will be sending them money to be able to open trades.[^3]

Questions that are relevant:

- Is it a real company?
- Where is it located?
- Who runs the company?
- Can you contact the company?
- Is your money handled safely?
