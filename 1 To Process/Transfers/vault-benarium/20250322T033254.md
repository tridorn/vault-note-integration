# Directive of 2025-03-22

## 🌅 1. Pre-Execution (Morning Planning)

### 🎯 Three Core Objectives

<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- [x] Set up curriculum
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- [x] Get up to date on courses
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
- [ ] Stay at Uni

### 🛠️ Process Intentions

<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1: Use computer at home, best in the first cycle
- Task 2: Download materials via computer and at home, also best in first cycle
- Task 3: Drive to Uni at 09:00, sit in Luisenpark until opening at 10:00

### ⚠️ Efficiency Killers to Mitigate

<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->
- Oversleeping
- Procrastination
- Mental blockages
- Unproductiveness

## ⚡ 2. Execution (Live Adjustments Throughout the Day)

### 📌 Bottleneck Log

<!-- What slowed execution today? E.g., distractions, over-perfection, slow decision-making, unexpected blockers. -->
- Distraction by entertainment

### 🔄 Real-Time Course Corrections

<!-- What tweaks were made mid-day to maintain efficiency? Only note direct changes to process. -->

## 🌙 3. Post-Execution Review (End of Day Process Optimization)

### 📉 Deviation Analysis

<!-- Did execution match expectation? If not, what caused deviation? -->
- ✅ Task 1:
- ✅ Task 2:  
- ✅ Task 3:  

### 🔍 Optimization Opportunities

<!-- What execution inefficiency should be addressed tomorrow? Focus on a single high-leverage improvement. -->
-

### 🧪 Micro-Iteration Commitment (Tomorrow’s Process Experiment)

<!-- What **one small tweak** will be tested tomorrow to refine execution? Keep it experimental and specific. -->
