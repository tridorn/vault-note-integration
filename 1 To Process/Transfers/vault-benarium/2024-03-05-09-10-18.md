# Margin Call

--- 

## Definition

A Margin Call occurs when you have breached the Margin Call Level but are still above the Stop Out Level.

--- 

## A Margin Call Isn't a Forced Liquidation

A Margin Call, is a WARNING, telling you that your account isn’t doing too well and that you are close to having your open positions liquidated at market price.

You are still allowed to keep your current positions open but you can’t open new positions
