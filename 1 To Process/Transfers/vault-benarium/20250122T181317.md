## Overview

This project developed (originally as a predecessor to Ben Dyk, until it got sidelined by it) alongside PR24260. Its chief aim was to create a personal brand in any way. With the initiation of PR25083 and the consolidation of fragmented efforts, its content got merged and this project archived in turn.
