# Stop Out Level

--- 

## Definition

The Stop Out Level is the specific level (%) where if your [[2024-03-05-09-12-31|Margin Level]] is equal or below it, your broker will automatically start closing your positions until the Margin Level is greater than the Stop Out Level.

--- 

## Example

For example, let’s say the Stop Out Level is 50%.

This means that if the Margin Level falls below 50% a Stop Out will automatically occur and the position floating the largest loss will be liquidated automatically.

This process will be repeated until the Margin Level increases to a level above 50%.

## How to Calculate

Stop Out Level = Margin Level at X%
