## Introduction

Dreaming here refers to the process of creating fantasy scenarios in ones head to experience. Venturing through uncharted forests, visiting bustling port towns, relaxing outside taverns on a warm summer evening - every kind of mental entertainment that is conscious. It works best when on bike with marvellous scenes flying past to spark creativity, even better in the morning or evening hours, before or after the hardships of the day. I primarily like to think of fantasy (genre) scenarios, with a hero and companions, as well as adventures just to my liking.
