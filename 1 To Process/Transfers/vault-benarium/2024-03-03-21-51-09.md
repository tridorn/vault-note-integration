## Definition

The Spot FX market is an over-the-counter (OTC) market, transactions are not done via an exchange but directly between different parties. It operates 24 hours a day.

## How Does the Spot FX Market Work?

In the spot market you trade contracts (not the underlying asset), to buy a specific currency at a specific price. The delivery of this currency is (as opposed to what the name spot may imply) not "on the spot" but rather a few business days later (regularly 2 days after, or T+2).
