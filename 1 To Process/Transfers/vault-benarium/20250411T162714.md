# PR 25 101 Document Corpus

## Overview

The Corporate Corpus is my approach of an attempt to formalise the core of a company and abstract it in a useful and actionable way. Meaning, it's not intended to be (too) academic. It aims at anyone trying to create, understand, restructure or in any other way view the very essence of a company.

I extended this project to contain non-corporate subjects.
