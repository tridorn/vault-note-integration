# Translucent Sky

I was just marvelling at the dawning of the day. The far edge of the sky was tinted in a rather dirty purple, shading over a light orange into the arriving blue. Dawn and dusk in Mannheim are a beautiful experience, potentially leveraged by the flat land of the Rhine plain. However, as I was trying to describe the colours in my head, I wondered about the effect that almost looks like a background glow. As if the colours are only translucent to something behind, yet that something isn't visible. I would love to know how I would gaze up at the sky if I didn't know about its nature. Thinking of it as the firmament like the humans of old. How that shapes my perception.
