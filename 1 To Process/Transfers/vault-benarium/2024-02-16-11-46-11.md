# CRAPM Categorise Logging Form Design

Creating a streamlined Google Form for logging data from the **Categorise** phase of the CRAPM method involves focusing on key data points that are both informative and easy to record. The goal is to capture essential information without making the logging process burdensome. Here are the data categories and suggested data units to include in your Google Form:

## 1. Items Processed

- **Question:** How many items did you process during this categorize phase?
- **Data Unit:** Number (Numeric input)

## 2. Items Actioned Immediately

- **Question:** How many items were actioned immediately (e.g., tasks completed within the two-minute rule)?
- **Data Unit:** Number (Numeric input)

## 3. Items Delegated

- **Question:** How many items did you delegate?
- **Data Unit:** Number (Numeric input)

## 4. Items Deferred

- **Question:** How many items did you defer for later action?
- **Data Unit:** Number (Numeric input)

## 5. Items Filed for Reference

- **Question:** How many items did you file for reference?
- **Data Unit:** Number (Numeric input)

## 6. Items Discarded

- **Question:** How many items did you discard or delete?
- **Data Unit:** Number (Numeric input)

## 7. New Projects Identified

- **Question:** How many new projects were identified during the categorization?
- **Data Unit:** Number (Numeric input)

## 8. Time Spent on Categorisation

- **Question:** How much time did you spend on the categorisation phase? (Keep this as brief as possible, ideally within a minute as planned.)
- **Data Unit:** Duration (e.g., minutes)

## Optional: Categorisation Effectiveness

- **Question:** How effective did you find this categorisation session? (This can help you gauge if the time spent categorising is yielding the expected clarity and organization.)
- **Data Unit:** Scale (e.g., 1-5, where 1 is not effective and 5 is very effective)

When setting up your Google Form, you can choose the "Short answer" type for numeric inputs and the "Linear scale" for the effectiveness rating. This setup ensures that the logging process remains quick and straightforward, allowing you to focus on the productivity method itself rather than spending excessive time on recording data.
