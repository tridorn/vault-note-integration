# Thinking Schemas

---

## Overview

---

## Where Are We? Where Do We Come From? Where Do We Go

It is a schema to analyse situations, similar to [[2024-03-17-12-42-41|Is it True? Is it Necessary? Is it Kind?]] only in a more general frame.

## Is it True? Is it Necessary? Is it Kind?

### How to Apply in Practice

Let your words pass through these gates and then consider your answer. I wouldn't use it as a definitive scheme but it can prove helpful in the moment. It is quite simple yet I realised that in practice it proves a powerful framework.

### Considerations

While if stuck to the original saying one need to follow this scheme step-by-step and validate it on every single question, only after finding everything true then you would be able to say it, I found it far more powerful if used as a 2/3 model. If 2 of the three in any kind of combination are found to be true, then you would be able to say your thing.
