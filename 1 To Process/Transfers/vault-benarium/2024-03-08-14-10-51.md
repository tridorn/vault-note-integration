# Trading the Break

--- 

## Introduction

- Buy when the price breaks the [[2024-03-08-13-52-10|Resistance]]
- Sell when the price breaks the [[2024-03-08-13-50-24|Support]]

Breaking essentially means that the price does not rebound from the resistance or support level but rather cuts through.

## How to Do

There are two ways to trade the break.

**Aggressive way**: You enter every time the price convincingly breaks the resistance or support level.

**Conservative way**: After the price breaks through the resistance or support, wait for a pullback or retest of the resistance or support level and if the old resistance or support now proves to be the reverse - a new support or resistance level - you enter.
