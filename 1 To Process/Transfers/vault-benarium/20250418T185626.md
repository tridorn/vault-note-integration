# Timeframes

---

## Overview

Timeframes themselves are boxed timespans, from one point to the other. In this systemothese clear-cut boxes of time are **segmented** (one follows on the other), **hierarchical** (every timeframe except for the highest and lowest is part of a larger timeframe and has lower timeframe children), and **delimited** (starting from a point of time, also called epoch).

To increase manageability and increase purpose (because not every level of timeframe is the same), timeframes are categorised into *tactical*, *operational*, *strategiec*, *epochal*, and *existential*.

---

## Tactical

Tactical timeframes are the lowest level and most focused on concrete action and iterative improvement.

**Purpose**:  
- Execute *short-term actions* with high efficiency.  
- Identify *immediate bottlenecks* and refine *on-the-spot* execution processes.  
- Focus purely on *action-oriented* decisions, not larger goals.  

**Primary Focus**:  
- "What is the most important action right now?"
- "How can this be executed better in the next cycle?"

**Key Difference from Operational**:  
- Very short scope (immediate or single-day execution).
- Micro-iterations on process improvement, not on broader goal shifts.
- No assessment of large-scale patterns—only instant optimisation.

## Operational

Operational timeframes move from tasks to goals, from iterative improvement to the detection of recurring patterns.

Here existing resources are allocated, and used in the most optimal way.

**Purpose**:  
- *Identify recurring inefficiencies* across multiple tactical cycles.  
- Implement *larger process adjustments* that impact mid-term efficiency.  
- Shift focus from "tasks" to *goal-oriented execution.*
- Ensure resources (time, energy, knowledge) are *efficiently allocated.*

**Primary Focus**:  
- "What larger patterns are emerging in execution efficiency?"
- "What process-level changes will enhance performance across multiple tactical cycles?"
- "How do we align execution with broader operational goals?"

**Key Difference from Tactical**:  
- More abstraction: Looks at process trends, not single-instance execution issues.
- More structured optimisations: Implements efficiency changes at a systemic level.
- Shift from execution to orchestration: Ensures that day-to-day operations build toward broader goals.

**Key Difference from Strategic**:
- Not long-term mission planning -> Focuses on execution adjustments, not high-level direction.
- Deals with systemic inefficiencies, not external positioning (i.e., doesn’t focus on "the market" or "competition").

## Strategic

Strategic timeframes are probably the most important goal-setting timespans. They represent where to go in the mid-to-long-term.

Strategic decisions are more of which direction to go, which skills to acquire, core structural decisions.

**Purpose**:  
- Define the *long-term mission* and structural vision.  
- Establish *big-picture resourcing*, positioning, and capabilities.  
- Ensure that operational efficiency aligns with overarching *organisational strategy*.
- Adapt to *external conditions* (market, competitive landscape, geopolitical shifts).  

**Primary Focus**:  
- "What is the ultimate direction?"
- "What structural investments are necessary?"
- "How should capabilities evolve to meet future challenges?"

**Key Difference from Operational**:
- Does not deal with process-level refinements -> Focuses on resourcing & positioning.  
- More external-facing -> Accounts for industry shifts, market trends, and macro changes.  
- Far fewer iterations -> Revisited far less frequently than operational timeframes.  

### Year Timeframe

The year is about aligning the next 12 months with longer-term directions, deciding which major shifts or things need to be done in career or personally.

**Purpose**: Structuring the next 12 months to align with long-term trajectory.

**Focus**: High-level capability development, major resource allocation, and trajectory positioning  

**Key Questions**:  
- What *high-leverage skills, networks, and knowledge* need to be built this year?
- What *fundamental structural shifts* (career, personal, financial) should be made?
- What are the *most significant strategic bets* I should take this year?

Essentially a **personal campaign plan**.

### Year5 Timeframe

The Year5 timeframe is not merely a mid-check of the Year10 timeframe, it tests for trajectory, yes, but also allows for major decisions in career and other areas.

**Purpose**: Defining the next 5 years in terms of trajectory shifts & systemic resource allocation.

**Focus**: Long-term capability-building, career/life positioning, and foundational high-impact decisions.  

**Key Questions**:  
- Where should my core *skills & knowledge* be in 5 years?_  
- What *positioning (career, financial, network)* should I have achieved?
- What *structural commitments* (investments, ventures, relocations) need to be locked in?_

Essentially **capability & positioning strategy**.

### Year10 Timeframe

The 10 year timeframe decides on the personal missions for this decade. Which endeavour I'm dedication my life's time to. It has major decision power on where to go

**Purpose**: Setting the ultimate direction for the personal & professional existence.  

**Focus**: What kind of life is being built? What will be the long-term economic, intellectual, and personal structure?  

**Key Questions**:  
- What *foundational personal mission* is worth dedicating the next decade to?
- What should be *permanently established* (wealth structures, networks, intellectual property)?
- What will *10 years of deliberate execution* create?

Essentially **long-term vision**.
