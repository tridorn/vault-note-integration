# Overview of Key Greek Philosophers and Their Relationships

### **Pre-Socratic Philosophers (6th-5th Century BCE)**

These thinkers primarily focused on cosmology, metaphysics, and natural philosophy. They laid the groundwork for subsequent philosophical inquiry.

1. **Thales of Miletus**  
	- Often regarded as the first philosopher.  
	- Believed water was the fundamental principle (arche) of all things.  
	- Mentor to Anaximander.

2. **Anaximander**  
	- Proposed the "apeiron" (the infinite or boundless) as the origin of all things.  
	- Influenced Anaximenes.

3. **Anaximenes**  
	- Claimed air (pneuma) was the primary substance.  
	- Continued the Milesian school's naturalistic approach.

4. **Heraclitus**  
	- Emphasized change and flux, encapsulated in his doctrine of the unity of opposites.  
	- Famously declared, "You cannot step into the same river twice."

5. **Parmenides**  
	- Countered Heraclitus with the assertion that "being" is eternal, unchanging, and indivisible.  
	- Founder of the Eleatic school. His ideas greatly influenced Plato.

6. **Pythagoras**  
	- Focused on mathematics and metaphysical harmony.  
	- Believed in the transmigration of souls and the mystical significance of numbers.

7. **Democritus**  
	- Developed atomic theory alongside Leucippus, proposing that all matter consists of indivisible atoms.  

8. **Empedocles**  
	- Introduced the idea of four root elements: earth, air, fire, and water.  
	- Combined these with forces of Love and Strife to explain change.

### **The Classical Triumvirate (5th-4th Century BCE)**

1. **Socrates (469-399 BCE)**  
	- Focused on ethics and the examination of human life.  
	- Developed the Socratic method, a dialectical approach to uncovering truth.  
	- Left no writings; his philosophy is known through his students, particularly Plato.  
	- Executed for allegedly corrupting the youth of Athens.

2. **Plato (427-347 BCE)**  
	- Socrates’ most famous student.  
	- Founder of the Academy in Athens.  
	- Wrote dialogues, many featuring Socrates as the main character.  
	- Developed the Theory of Forms, asserting that non-material abstract Forms (e.g., beauty, justice) represent the most accurate reality.  
	- Teacher of Aristotle.

3. **Aristotle (384-322 BCE)**  
	- Student of Plato but diverged significantly in thought.  
	- Founded the Lyceum and developed a comprehensive system of philosophy covering logic, ethics, politics, biology, and metaphysics.  
	- Rejected Plato’s Theory of Forms in favor of empiricism and the study of particulars.  
	- Tutored Alexander the Great.

### **Hellenistic Philosophers (4th-2nd Century BCE)**

After Aristotle, philosophy shifted toward practical ethics and personal tranquility.

1. **Epicurus (341-270 BCE)**  
	- Founder of Epicureanism.  
	- Advocated for ataraxia (tranquility) through the pursuit of simple pleasures and the avoidance of pain.

2. **Zeno of Citium (334-262 BCE)**  
	- Founder of Stoicism.  
	- Emphasized virtue, rationality, and living in harmony with nature.  
	- Stoicism later influenced Roman thinkers like Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.

3. **Pyrrho (c. 360-270 BCE)**  
	- Originator of Skepticism.  
	- Advocated for suspension of judgment (epoché) to achieve mental peace.

### **Interrelations And Intellectual Evolution**

- **Socrates** is the wellspring from which Plato and Aristotle emerged, forming the foundation of Western philosophy.
- Plato’s **idealism** provided the metaphysical underpinnings that Aristotle critiqued, replacing them with a more empirical methodology.
- The transition to **Hellenistic philosophy** reflects a shift from metaphysics to ethics, as philosophers sought to address the turbulence of post-Alexandrian society.
- Pre-Socratics provided the **cosmological and metaphysical framework**, while Socratic and post-Socratic philosophers moved toward questions of ethics, politics, and human flourishing.

This intricate tapestry of intellectual relationships illustrates the progression of Greek philosophy, from inquiries into the nature of the cosmos to the examination of human existence.
