## Quotes

> He would be a good-looking man if he were not ugly; he is tall and built like Hercules, but of an African tint; eyes full of life and fire, but touchy, wary, rancorous--and this gives him a ferocious air. It is easier to put him in a rage than to make him gay. He laughs little, but makes others laughâ€¦. He has a manner of saying things which reminds me of Harlequin or Figaro, and which makes them sound witty.
-- Prince Charles de Ligne on Casanova
