## 15:00-15:30

1. **Review economic calendar and news**
2. **Identify key levels:**  
	- Use **horizontal lines** to mark the previous dayâ€™s high, low, and key pivot levels.  
	- Note major support/resistance levels near VWAP or around key EMAs.
3. **Create alerts (TradingView Pro users):**
	- Set price alerts to notify you when price:
	  - **Crosses VWAP (bullish/bearish bias shift)**  
	  - **Reaches key support/resistance levels**

## 15:30-17:30

Main trading session. Paper trade index futures

1. **Step 1: Wait for Your Setup**  
	- Monitor price action around VWAP and 20-EMA.  
	- Example setup (bullish trade):  
	  - Price is above VWAP (bullish bias).  
	  - Price pulls back to the 20-EMA without closing below it.  
	  - RSI is not overbought (below 70).  
	  - Entry trigger: A candle closes back above the 20-EMA, confirming a continuation of the uptrend.
2. **Step 2: Place the Order on Interactive Brokersâ€™ TWS**  
	- **Interactive Brokers (IBKR) Order Types:**  
	  - **Limit Order:** Preferred for most entries, ensuring you control the entry price.  
	  - **Bracket Order (Recommended):** Automatically set stop-loss and take-profit levels.  
	  - **OCO Order:** Useful if you want to place both a breakout order and a pullback order, with one canceling the other.
	**Example Order Workflow:**  
	- You want to enter long at 4305 (limit order).  
	- Stop-loss at 4300 (below previous swing low).  
	- Take profit at 4315 (targeting 2:1 risk/reward).  
	- In TWS, select **Bracket Order:**  
	  - **Entry:** Limit at 4305  
	  - **Stop-loss:** 4300  
	  - **Take profit:** 4315  

*ðŸŽ¯ **Pro Tip:** Interactive Brokersâ€™ hotkeys can speed up placing these orders. Configure them to quickly submit limit orders and bracket setups.*

## 17:30-18:00

Post-market analysis, reflection, and logging of trades

1. **Log the trade:**  
	Use **Edgewonk, Notion, or Excel** to record key details:
	- Entry and exit prices  
	- Reason for entry  
	- P/L (after commissions)  
	- Mistakes or lessons learned  

2. **Analyze your execution:**  
	- Did you follow your strategy correctly?  
	- Was your stop-loss placed properly, or did you overreact?  
	- Were commissions and slippage accounted for?
