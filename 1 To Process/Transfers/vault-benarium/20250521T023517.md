# Eupator Setup

---

## Overview

Contains most of relevant information, process, and checklist for the setup of Eupator. Its purpose is to serve as a centralised repository, gathering every kind of fragmented data and input on the matter

---

## Legal Structure

Double setup, **holding** and **operational** company. Form is going to be UG for both.

Why a holding structure? Eupator is envisioned to be trans-national, design has to consider that from the start. Furthermore will I leave Germany in a few years and a multi-layer structure eases some of the complexity.
