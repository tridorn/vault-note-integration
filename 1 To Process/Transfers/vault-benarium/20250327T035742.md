# Directive of 2025-03-27

## 🌅 1. Pre-Execution (Morning Planning)

### Today's Mission

<!-- What broader chief aim do you want to accomplish today? -->
- [x] Stay awake as designated

### 🎯 Three Core Objectives

<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- [x] Have benjendyk.com and eupator.de online and operational
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- [ ] Set up Notion space for future work
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
- [ ] Initiated first venture

### 🛠️ Process Intentions

<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1:
- Task 2:
- Task 3:

### ⚠️ Efficiency Killers to Mitigate

<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->

## ⚡ 2. Execution (Live Adjustments Throughout the Day)

### 📌 Bottleneck Log

<!-- What slowed execution today? E.g., distractions, over-perfection, slow decision-making, unexpected blockers. -->
- Not doing a review or planning
- Started flagging half-hour timeframe directives again
- Tiredness (evening hours, didn't nap today to reduce sleep debt)

### 🔄 Real-Time Course Corrections

<!-- What tweaks were made mid-day to maintain efficiency? Only note direct changes to process. -->
- Strict 25/5 split

---

## 🌙 3. Post-Execution Review (End of Day Process Optimization)

### 📉 Deviation Analysis

<!-- Did execution match expectation? If not, what caused deviation? -->
- ✅ Task 1: Only managed to get benjendyk.com up and running. However, much time was spent on learning the basics, the knowledge that will allow me to be fast next time
- ✅ Task 2: Didn't get to this task, as I also started my daily responsibilities, day trading and programming among them (taking 6 hours together)
- ✅ Task 3: Same as above

### 🔍 Optimization Opportunities

<!-- What execution inefficiency should be addressed tomorrow? Focus on a single high-leverage improvement. -->
- Not using the 5 minutes for mindfulness, but work instead

### 🧪 Micro-Iteration Commitment (Tomorrow’s Process Experiment)

<!-- What **one small tweak** will be tested tomorrow to refine execution? Keep it experimental and specific. -->
- Do naps as scheduled
