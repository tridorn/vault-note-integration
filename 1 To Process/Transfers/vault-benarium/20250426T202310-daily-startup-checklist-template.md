## Idea

**Goal**: Select a startup idea to work on.

### Industry or Problem Space

- If not, use a **random industry generator** or a **list of problem spaces**.
- Example prompts:
  - "A startup in the *AI industry*"
  - "A business solving *time management* issues"
  - "A new take on *sustainable fashion*"



### Quick Validation

Ask:
- Is this interesting to me? (Motivation matters.)
- Does it solve a real problem?
- Is it unique enough to be worth pursuing?
- Would this be fun to build?
