# PR 25 099 Formalise Note-Taking System

---

## Overview

This is a spin-off from the previous catch-all project PR24318 (Set Up System) and aims at providing a granular insight into what exactly what done historically (many smaller instead of one big among some smaller ones).

Just as the name says it aims at formalising how to take notes in a structured system consisting of different component that allow for a differentiated and modular view of everything related.
