## Events of the Time Frame

I woke up at 03:00,drank water, went to the toilet and at a banana with a bit of bread (I was out of bread) and an egg.

Fro 03:30 onwards I watched various Anime, first session 1 episode 6 of 100 girls that really want to be your girlfriend (?), then Overlord Season 1 episode 13. I was searching around for quite some time but then started with Black Clover, watched episodes 4 to 6.

I napped at 07:00. From 07:30 to 08:30 - for the first time ever in the morning - I completed a fascia roll workout.

From then onwards until 13:00 I had various phases of on and off productivity, I worked on drafting the document of [[Path of Imperius]] together with ChatGPT. I was waiting for my new phone, the iPhone 15 Pro to arrive and was excited accordingly.

Made and ate lunch at 13:00, had nap 2 at 13:30.

While the rest of the day was characterised through an application of the [[Time Plan System]], I diligently (more or less) followed the half an hour time frames (first time after [[Year50 1 Year10 3 Year5 1 Year 4 Quarter 4 Month 2 Week 3 Day 7|yesterday]], the time from 14:00 onwards was neither in the time plan system, nor productive in any way. I worked on the path of Imperius on and off, read chapter 1 to 6 of "Das erste Horn" by RIchard Schwartz but otherwise spent my time waiting for the arrival of my phone, which it did at around 16:00.

I went swimming at 18:30 in the Nordbad, did some lanes of freestyle, but then decided quite fast I wanted to relax. I had an unpleasant experience with another guest about the Dampfkabine, I sprayed water into the machine (I saw someone doing it earlier) and was rebuked by a quite agitated man. I didn't insist on my point too strongly, however, as my nature is, I debated him. He was very quick to anger and even got the Bademeister involved. As previously said, I didn't insist too strongly and excused myself, but the situation was still overblown for what it started.  
From the start I knew this would kill my evening, I didn't feel too badly about it righ at the start, the problems arose when my brain just couldn't let go of the situation. Even at the time of writing this document (the next day at 04:30, because I didn't got the time to write it at the end of the current day) it is still lingering at the outsets of my consciousness. It is influencing my mood in an undoubtedly bad way, however minor the encounter was.  
What is making me mad (not really mad, I look at the situation quite cool-headed) is not necessarily the situation or even my response (the general response), it is rather that I could solved it way more eloquently. I am still too dependent/immature (not really feeling like a full adult). An encounter this small shouldn't influence me this intensely. I really have to up my resilience for I will encounter way worse adversity going forward.  
I hope the time spent formulating this, putting it into words and dragging it out of my mind, was worth it.

I got home at around 20:30, ate some Br√∂tchen (I went to buy bread after swimming but they were out of it) and watched episodes 6 and 7 of the anime Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

I fumbled the rest of my time and didn't get to the [[Categorise and Review and Adjust and Plan & Mindfulness|Conclusion of the Day]], instead I had to forcefully interrupt my doing and go to sleep.

## Conclusion

All in all it was a successful day I reckon, alone for the sleep rhythm I dutefully obeyed.
