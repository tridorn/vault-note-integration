# 20230212181750

- Legalixer / legalix
- Rechtfix
- Legarix (Gari is the name for the ai + lex)

# Books

- 4 Steps to the E.piphany
- The Startup Owner’s Manual
- The Innovator's Dilemma

# Ideas

- AI legal advice
- Lawyer gives stamp on what AI created (curates)
- Not necessary to have full-fledge lawyer (possibly), concept of freelance lawyers and llb, llm
- Main selling point: cheaper, better in communication (ai is forgiving)
- Not restricted to law, every industry that serves people (tax advice etc.), front ai, in the back an expert
- idea: basic product is free, example of will, users goes through the steps, puts everything in, gets adviced. At the end of the process our model comes in, if the user wants the will *and* the stamp of our lawyer he has to pay

# Ecosystem

1. A user-friendly web or mobile platform for customers to access the legal advice tool. This could include a chatbot or natural language processing (NLP) system to assist customers in understanding and navigating the legal process.
2. A database of legal information and documents that the NLP system can draw from to provide customers with accurate and relevant legal advice.
3. A document generation system that can automatically generate legal documents based on the customer's input and the legal information in the database.
4. A system of legal review, where a team of lawyers reviews the generated documents to ensure they are accurate and legally binding.
5. A billing and payment system that allows customers to pay for document generation and legal review services.
6. A customer relationship management system that keeps track of customer information and interactions, allowing for personalized communication and follow-up.
7. An analytics system that tracks customer behavior, usage, and feedback to help improve the service and identify opportunities for innovation.
8. A marketing and advertising strategy that targets potential customers and educates them about the benefits of the service.
9. A customer support system that provides assistance and answers customer inquiries.
10. Compliance and security measures to ensure that the service is compliant with local laws and regulations, and that customer data is protected.


- Wizard of Oz testing (customer thinks he is interacting with product, but humans in background)
- As we start in a small legal field, we can collaborate with a law firm that specializes in that field. They would provide the legal review. Possibly could be done through a tighter cooperation where they invest in us. Would probably be a good start until we decide where to get our professionals from
- We could market our tool inside of the Juristische Fakultät and use law students as test subjects

1. Set up the branding (in-person meeting)
2. Stitching together a mvp (also possible to launch a mvp under a different brand)
3. Researching the market
4. Going out and asking customers
