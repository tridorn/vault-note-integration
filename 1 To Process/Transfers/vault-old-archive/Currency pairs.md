# Currency pairs

---

## Description

Forex trading means selling one currency and buying the other one - everything is bought as currency pairs.

Categories of currency pairs:

1. Majors
2. Crosses
3. Exotics

**Major pairs** always include USD.

**Cross-currency** pairs do not include USD (crosses that both are major currencies are also called minors).

**Exotic pairs** consist of one [[Major Currencies]] and one currency from an emerging market.

Lesser traded pairs like exotic pairs have lower liquidity and higher spreads. They also are more sensitive to economic and geopolitical events.
