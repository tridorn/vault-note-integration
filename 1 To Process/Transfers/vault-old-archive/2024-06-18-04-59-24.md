When you are working within a defined timeframe, you are ultimately working towards achieving the **objective** you have set. The objective represents the specific goal or aim for that particular period. The tasks you have shortlisted are the actions or steps you need to take to reach that objective. The expected outcome is the tangible result you anticipate achieving once you have completed the objective.

Here's a breakdown of how these elements work together:

### Workflow Breakdown

1. **Objective**:
	- **What It Is**: The clear, specific goal you want to accomplish within the timeframe.
	- **Example**: "Draft the introduction section of the client presentation."

2. **Expected Outcome**:
	- **What It Is**: The tangible result you expect to have once the objective is achieved.
	- **Example**: "Completed draft of the introduction section."

3. **Tasks**:
	- **What They Are**: The actionable steps or activities you need to perform to achieve the objective.
	- **Example**:
	  - Research relevant data for the introduction.
	  - Outline the key points to cover.
	  - Write the first draft.

### During the Timeframe

- **Focus on the Objective**: Your primary focus is to work towards achieving the objective.
- **Execute the Tasks**: You perform the tasks you have identified, as these are the steps that will lead you to accomplish the objective.
- **Achieve the Expected Outcome**: By completing the tasks and meeting the objective, you aim to achieve the expected outcome.

### Example Process

#### Before the Timeframe

1. **Set Objective**: "Draft the introduction section of the client presentation."
2. **Define Expected Outcome**: "Completed draft of the introduction section."
3. **Shortlist Tasks**:
	- Research relevant data for the introduction.
	- Outline the key points to cover.
	- Write the first draft.

#### During the Timeframe

1. **Work on Tasks**:
	- **Research relevant data for the introduction**: Spend the first 10 minutes gathering and reviewing data.
	- **Outline the key points to cover**: Use the next 10 minutes to create a structured outline.
	- **Write the first draft**: Dedicate the remaining 10 minutes to writing the introduction draft based on your outline and research.

2. **Monitor Progress**:
	- Ensure you stay on track with each task to achieve the objective within the timeframe.

#### After the Timeframe

1. **Review**:
	- Compare what you have completed with the expected outcome: "Is the draft of the introduction section completed?"

2. **Reflect**:
	- Assess whether the tasks were sufficient to meet the objective.
	- Note any challenges or adjustments needed for future timeframes.

### Summary

In each timeframe, you are:

- **Working on Tasks**: These are the actions you perform.
- **Aiming to Achieve the Objective**: This is the goal you set for the timeframe.
- **Trying to Realize the Expected Outcome**: This is the tangible result you want to see at the end.

By focusing on the objective and completing the tasks, you work towards achieving the expected outcome, ensuring that each timeframe is productive and aligned with your broader goals.
