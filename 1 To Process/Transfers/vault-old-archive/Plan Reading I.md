# Plan Reading I

---

## Description

The aim of this plan is to further my ability by introducing great ideas and concepts of old and new via the medium of the book.

The books in this list will be read and worked with in the order of their appearance. The aim is to not only look at the words but really dig into the underlaying meaning, figures of speech. This is mainly achieved by following the guidelines that [[Working with literature]] sets.
