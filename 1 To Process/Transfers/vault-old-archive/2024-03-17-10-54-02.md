# Use Formulating to Support the Process of Creative Idea Formation

--- 

## What it Means

Formulating, writing on paper a thought that you are developing helps in logically delimiting and extending this thought, and allows for a more structured approach to the topic.

--- 

## How to Apply in Practice

When developing a thought, especially knowledge work, that is, creating something new instead of simply summarising something old, use any kind of medium to write on the topic. This text doesn't have to be preserved or used, just writing about it in any way helps getting a clearer picture and discovering logical pitfalls.
