# Retail Forex

---

## Definition

There is a secondary OTC market for retail traders (with less financial capabilities) that is opened up via "forex trading providers" (technically not brokers, as they are your direct counterparty and not simply act as a middleman) and allows for the leveraged trading of currencies. You are trading the contract to deliver the currency, rather than the currency itself (retail forex traders can not "take or make delivery" on leveraged spot forex contracts), this allows you to leverage.

## Description

On the date of settlement (theoretically physical delivery) the contract is "rolled over" for retail forex clients (also called rolling spot forex transaction or rolling spot FX contract. Forex trading providers automatically roll over your position indefinitely until is closed, on every roll over a few is charged, called swap fee or rollover fee.
