# Definition Type

Make each definition atomic by focusing on one key term or concept within the subtopic. Ensure that each definition is self-contained and provides a clear understanding of the specific term or concept being defined. To enhance this section, consider adding a 'Key Terms' subsection that lists and defines any important terms or concepts.
