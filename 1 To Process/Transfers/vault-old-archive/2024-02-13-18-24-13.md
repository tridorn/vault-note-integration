# Categorise - Review - Adjust - Plan & Mindfulness

--- 

## Introduction

Categorise, Review, Adjust, Plan & Mindfulness is the descriptive name for a system that does exactly what its name prescibes (in order) for a [[Time Frames|Time Frame]]. It is designed in such a way that it can be applied in every hierachichal layer, from half an hour all the way up to 50 years. Some parts may be more pronounced in different time frame layers, but it is important to remember that [[CRAPM is for Administrative Work Only]], that means a strict focus on the process and no work beyond that.

## Categorise

Categorising means bringing all the new [[Stuff]] that appeared in the [[Inbox in Task System|inbox]] since the last categorisation into the system. The fundamental principle of [[Task System]] is to have the whole physical landscape captured and put on paper, categorising means bringing this map of things up to date.

## Review

The review is a look back at only the current, concluding time frame under various aspects such as

#a/eX 

--- 

## Plan

This is probably the (at least in terms of time spent) most important step in the process. The previous steps can be seen as simply laying the groundwork or contributing to expand the available options in plan.

#a/eX

## Adjust

Adjust is a way to make changes to any time frame that is available (which haven't concluded already). This step breaks from the linear focus of review and plan on only the last and next time frame. It may be applied more often in higher time frames as the time in for example half an hour is simply too short to make wide ranging changes.

## Mindfulness

Depending on the time spent on the previous steps this step may fall shorter or be longer. The purpose of greater CRAPM is to create an interruption in the flow of time and align the actions with higher spans (in a general way, alternative way of saying "to take a step back and look at the bigger picture"). Mindfulness is a small but very important part of that. 

All the steps before mindfulness should be concluded as fast as possible, mindfulness essentially is the release or the reward for the work of the time frame and work done in CRAPM as well as to prepare and get in the right mind for the next time frame. This is especially important in the "main unit of work", the half an hour time frames.[^1] There also isn't really a strict cut off at the beginning of the next time frame, I can take the time I need for a release but of course have to get back to my planned actions as soon as possible.

Mindfulness or general relaxation isn't limited to CRAPM, it is only mandatory there.

## Process

1. *Categorise*
	1. **What is new since the last time I checked?**
		 - Check Drafts inbox
	2. **Is it actionable?** (For each new item identified)
		 - Yes: Proceed to question 3.
		 - No: Proceed to question 5.
	3. **What is the next action?**
		 - If it can be done in under two minutes, do it now.
		 - Otherwise, what is the specific next step?
	4. **Where does the next action belong?**
		 - **Single Actions:** Can it be completed quickly? Add to one of the Next Actions lists.
		 - **Projects:** Does it require multiple steps? Add the project and outcome to the Projects list and first step to one of the Next Actions lists.
		 - **Appointments:** Is it date/time specific? Schedule it in your calendar.
	5. **If not actionable, what are my options?**
		 - **Trash:** Discard if not needed.
		 - **Incubate:** Is it for future consideration? Add to Someday/Maybe list or set a reminder.
		 - **Reference:** Useful for future reference? File it accordingly.
	6. **Do I need to delegate or defer it?**
		 - **Delegate:** If someone else can do it, who? Add it to your Waiting For list with a follow-up.
		 - **Defer:** If it's for later, schedule a time to revisit or place it in the appropriate context for future action.
	7. **Have I captured everything new?**
		 - Ensure no new item has been missed in the process.
2. *Review*
	1. **What did I do in the last 25 minutes?**
	2. **What did I accomplish?**
		- List the tasks you completed. This reinforces a sense of achievement and clarity about your progress.
	3. **Were there tasks I did not get to? If so, why?**
		- Understanding why certain tasks were not addressed allows for better planning and prioritization in the next cycle.
	4. **How well did I stick to my planned tasks?**
		- Assessing your adherence to the plan can help identify if you're overestimating your capacity or need to adjust your task selection criteria.
	5. **Did I encounter any interruptions or distractions? How did I handle them?**
		- Identifying interruptions helps in strategizing ways to minimize them in future sessions.
	6. **What challenges did I face, and what can I learn from them?**
		- Reflect on any challenges to improve your approach or strategies for similar tasks in the future.
	7. **How do I feel about my work and progress in the last segment?**
		- Emotional reflection can provide insights into your work satisfaction and motivation levels, guiding future task selection and planning.
	8. **What insights can I apply to the next segment for better results?**
		- Use this review to adapt and refine your approach, improving efficiency and effectiveness in subsequent cycles.
3. 	*Plan*
	1. **What does my calendar tell me about fixed commitments in the next segment?**
		- Check your calendar for any appointments or time-bound obligations that will affect your available time for other tasks.
	2. **What are the key objectives from my higher time frame plan that need attention in this segment?**
		- Review your broader goals to ensure that your plan for the next segment contributes to these larger objectives.
	3. **Which contexts am I currently operating in, and what are the relevant Next Actions Lists for this context?**
		- Identify the context you'll be in (e.g., at your desk, in meetings, running errands) and review the corresponding Next Actions Lists to select tasks that fit this setting.
	4. **Considering my current context and the time I have available, what can realistically be accomplished in the next segment?**
		- Be realistic about what you can achieve in the allotted time, considering any fixed commitments and the context you're in.
	5. **How do my energy levels and current priorities influence the selection of tasks for the next segment?**
		- Choose tasks that match your current energy level and align with your most pressing priorities. High-energy tasks should be scheduled for when you're most alert, and lower-energy tasks for when you're less so.
	6. **Based on the above, what are the most important tasks to complete in the next segment?**
		- Decide on the specific tasks that you will commit to completing, ensuring they are both achievable and aligned with your larger goals.
	7. **How will I sequence these tasks for maximum efficiency and impact?**
		- Plan the order of tasks to optimize workflow, considering factors like task dependency, required energy levels, and potential synergies between tasks.
4. *Adjust*
	1. **How can I refine my workspace and personal strategies to boost focus and productivity for the next segment?**
		 - Consider both environmental adjustments (like organizing your workspace or managing noise and lighting) and personal actions (such as adopting new work techniques or taking short breaks) that together enhance efficiency and reduce stress. This unified approach ensures a conducive setting and optimizes personal readiness for the tasks ahead.
	2. **How should I adjust my tasks based on new insights or priorities?**
		 - This involves a comprehensive reassessment of your task list. Consider reprioritizing tasks, adding new actions, breaking larger tasks into more manageable steps, or even delegating and deferring as needed to align with your current objectives, insights from the last session, and overall capacity. The focus is on flexible task management to maintain or improve workflow efficiency.
	3. **Do I need to realign my broader goals (daily, weekly, monthly) in light of recent developments or achievements?**
		 - Review the congruence between recent progress and your longer-term objectives. Adjust your strategic planning as necessary to ensure continued alignment with your goals, reflecting on any new information or accomplishments that may shift priorities or timelines.
5. *Mindfulness*
	1. (If possible) Stand up and move
	2. Relax
	3. Stay present

[^1]: The half an hour time frames can also be referred to as the "main unit of work", because while every time frame has TFOKR, the half an hour time frame is the only one who also has tasks, and tasks are what is being worked on
