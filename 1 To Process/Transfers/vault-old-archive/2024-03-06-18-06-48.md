# Access YAML Property

--- 

## Defining Access Levels

First, define a set of access levels that suit your needs. Here are some common levels and their potential meanings:

- **Private**: The note is for your eyes only. It should not be shared with others or published.
- **Public**: The note can be freely shared or published, with no restrictions on viewership.
- **Shared**: The note is intended for a specific group of people, such as a project team, family members, or friends.
- **Confidential**: The note contains sensitive information and should only be accessed by individuals with explicit permission.
- **Archived**: The note is no longer actively used or updated but is kept for historical reference. Access might be restricted based on its content.

## Implementing the Access Property

In your note's YAML header, you would define the `access` property like this:

```yaml
access: Private
```

Or, for a note intended for team collaboration:

```yaml
access: Shared
```

## Guidelines for Use

1. **Consistency**: Apply your access levels consistently across your notes. This consistency helps in managing and understanding access at a glance.

2. **Integration with Tools**: If you use tools or scripts to manage your notes, consider implementing functionality that respects the `access` property. For example, you could create a script that filters notes based on their access level for different purposes (e.g., generating a list of public notes for publishing).

3. **Review and Update**: Periodically review your notes to ensure that their assigned access levels are still appropriate. Adjust as necessary, especially for notes that might become more sensitive or less confidential over time.

4. **Collaboration and Sharing Protocols**: If you're working in a collaborative environment or sharing notes with others, establish clear protocols or guidelines that explain how different access levels should be treated. For instance, "Shared" notes might be stored in a specific shared directory or platform where all team members have access.

5. **Security and Encryption**: For notes with "Confidential" or "Private" access levels, consider additional security measures such as encryption or storing them in a secure location to prevent unauthorized access.

6. **Documentation**: Document the meaning of each access level and any related protocols in your system documentation. This is especially important in collaborative settings to ensure everyone understands how to handle notes of different access levels.

## Adapting the Access Property

The above guide is a starting point. You might find that your needs require additional or different access levels. For example, you might add "Review" for notes that are under consideration by peers or "Draft" for personal notes that are not yet finalized. Adapt the access levels to fit your workflow and privacy needs, ensuring that they help rather than hinder your note management.
