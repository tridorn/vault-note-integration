# Categorise and Review and Adjust and Plan & Mindfulness

--- 

## Exposition

Categorise, Review, Adjust, Plan & Mindfulness is the descriptive name for a system that does exactly what its name prescibes (in order) for a [[Time Frames|Time Frame]]. It is designed in such a way that it can be applied in every hierachichal layer, from half an hour all the way up to 50 years. Some parts may be more pronounced in different time frame layers, but it is important to remember that [[CRAPM is for Administrative Work Only]], that means a strict focus on the process and no work beyond that.

## Categorise

Categorising means bringing all the new [[Stuff]] that appeared in the [[Inbox in Task System|inbox]] since the last categorisation into the system. The fundamental principle of [[Task System]] is to have the whole physical landscape captured and put on paper, categorising means bringing this map of things up to date.

## Review

The review is a look back at only the current, concluding time frame under various aspects such as

#a/eX 

--- 

## Adjust

Adjust is a way to make changes to any time frame that is available (which haven't concluded already). This step breaks from the linear focus of review and plan on only the last and next time frame. It may be applied more often in higher time frames as the time in for example half an hour is simply too short to make wide ranging changes.

## Plan

This is probably the (at least in terms of time spent) most important step in the process. The previous steps can be seen as simply laying the groundwork or contributing to expand the available options in plan.

## Mindfulness

Depending on the time spent on the previous steps this step may fall shorter or be longer. The purpose of greater CRAPM is to create an interruption in the flow of time and align the actions with higher spans (in a general way, alternative way of saying "to take a step back and look at the bigger picture"). Mindfulness is a small but very important part of that. 

All the steps before mindfulness should be concluded as fast as possible, mindfulness essentially is the release or the reward for the work of the time frame and work done in CRAPM as well as to prepare and get in the right mind for the next time frame. This is especially important in the "main unit of work", the half an hour time frames.[^1] There also isn't really a strict cut off at the beginning of the next time frame, I can take the time I need for a release but of course have to get back to my planned actions as soon as possible.

Mindfulness or general relaxation isn't limited to CRAPM, it is only mandatory there.

## Process

1. *Categorise*
	1. Categorise Drafts inbox
	2. Categorise Obsidian inbox
	3. Categorise OneDrive inbox
2. *Review*
	1. Visualise the last CRAPM and everything that occurred in between
	2. Note events of the time frame 
		1. For half an hour time frames as prose in a Drafts document
		2. For day and upwards time frames via [[Events of the Time Frame]])
	3. Note data
		1. For half an hour time frames as a log of the [[Review Questions]]
		2. For day and upwards time frames as a comment via [[Data Analysis of the Time Frame]])
3. *Adjust*
	1. Check the very now, what can be optimised?
	2. Adjust any time frame #a/cF
4. *Plan*
	1. Check calendar
	2. Check higher time frame
	3. Check next actions, update if necessary
	4. (for half an hour time frames) Set actions in current based on context, time available, energy, priority
	5. (for day and upwards time frames) Check Projects, update if necessary
	6. (for day and upwards time frames) Check Someday/Maybe, update if necessary
	7. (for day and upwards time frames) Note [[Time Frame Objectives and Key Results|TFOKR]] for the next time frame using the [[Natural Planning Method]]
	8. (for half an hour time frames) Find and note the very first next action step
5. *Mindfulness*
	1. (If possible) Stand up and move
	2. Relax
	3. Stay present

[^1]: The half an hour time frames can also be referred to as the "main unit of work", because while every time frame has TFOKR, the half an hour time frame is the only one who also has tasks, and tasks are what is being worked on
