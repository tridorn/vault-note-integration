# Project-Based Organization of Digital Media Creations

---

## Introduction

To organize and distribute the underlying concepts of your current folders, which span a variety of digital media creation and editing tools, it’s beneficial to think about categorizing based on project type, workflow stages, and tool-specific files. This way, you can maintain a structure that is intuitive for both current and future projects. Here’s a suggested organization strategy that takes into account the creative process, from conceptualization to final render:

--- 

## 1. **Project-Based Organization**

Instead of separating by software, consider organizing by project. Each project folder can contain subfolders for the different applications used. This approach centralizes all files related to a project in one place, making it easier to manage and archive.

- **Project Name**
  - **Pre-Production**: Scripts, storyboards, concept art.
  - **Production**
	 - **After Effects Data**: For motion graphics, compositing.
	 - **Cinema 4D Data**: For 3D models, animations.
	 - **Premiere Pro Data**: For video editing.
	 - **Sony Vegas Data**: Alternative for video editing, if used.
	 - **Audition Data**: For audio editing and sound design.
	 - **Intro**: If you create a unique intro for this project, keep it here.
  - **Render**: Final outputs from any software.
  - **Assets**: Common assets used across different software.
  - **Reviews**: Feedback, notes for revisions.

## 2. **Tool-Specific Libraries**

For elements you reuse across projects (like templates, presets, or common assets), maintain a separate library. This can be subdivided by the type of asset or the tool they are associated with.

- **Library or Assets**
  - **After Effects Templates**
  - **Cinema 4D Models**
  - **Premiere Pro Presets**
  - **Sound Effects**: For Audition.
  - **Visual Effects**: Stock footage, textures for After Effects or Cinema 4D.

## 3. **Final Renders**

You might still want a dedicated place for all final renders to easily access your completed work.

- **Final Renders**
  - **By Year or Client**: Organizing renders by year or client can make retrieval straightforward.
  - **Project Name**: Keep final versions here, possibly with versioning or date of creation.

--- 

## 4. **Archives**

For completed projects, consider moving them to an archive section. This helps in decluttering your active working space but keeps old projects accessible if needed.

- **Archives**
  - **Project Name**: Archived projects, each containing all related files.

--- 

## Conclusion

This structure is flexible and scalable, allowing you to add more categories as needed, such as documentation, client feedback, or specific research for projects. The key is consistency in how you apply the structure, making it easier over time to locate and manage your digital assets and projects.
