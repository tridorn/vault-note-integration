## Definition

Sentiment Analysis is used to determine how *other traders feel*.[^1]

The market is a network of interconnected individuals, that all have their own opinion of the state of the economy and where the market should or will go, it is important to take another factor in account to get the bet overall picture, the market sentiment.[^1]
