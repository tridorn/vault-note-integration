## Introduction

The start of the day is part of [[Workflows for Certain Times of the Day]] and has the goal of optimising and streamlining the time immediately after waking up. It fills and is limited to the first half an hour [[Time Frames|Time Frame]] which is characterised through a mind not yet up to speed. See also [[Segmentation of a Day]] (the 03:00 time frame) for a better overview of the position of this concept in the overall day.
