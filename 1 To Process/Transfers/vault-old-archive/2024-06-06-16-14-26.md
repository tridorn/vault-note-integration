# Scopes as External Access Points

Absolutely! Let's dive deeper into how Scopes function as access points to external systems and how they integrate with Time Rooms, while maintaining the overall structure within Obsidian.

### 1. Areas

**Folder: Areas**
- **Content**: Broad categories (e.g., Health, Work).
- **Files**: Each file represents an Area.

### 2. Plans

**Folder: Plans**
- **Content**: Detailed brainstorming and content.
- **Files**: Each file represents a Plan.

### 3. Systems

**Folder: Systems**
- **Content**: Organized frameworks based on Plans.
- **Files**: Each file represents a System.

### 4. Scopes

**Folder: Scopes**
- **Content**: General information about each Scope.
- **Files**: Each file provides an overview and links to external implementations.

### 5. Schemas

**Folder: Schemas**
- **Content**: Visual representations of relationships between elements.
- **Files**: Each file represents a Schema.

### 6. Time Rooms

**Folder: Time Rooms**
- **Content**: Specific timeframes.
- **Files**: Each file represents a Time Room.

### Detailed Breakdown and Integration

#### Scopes

**Definition**: Abstract representations of systems implemented through various platforms (e.g., task management software, databases).

**Content**:
1. **Overview of the Scope**:
	- General information and purpose.
	- Relationship to related Systems and Plans.
2. **External Implementations**:
	- Links to task management software, databases, or other tools.
	- Description of how these external tools are utilized.
3. **Integration Points**:
	- Methods of syncing and integrating with external systems.
	- Instructions for using these integrations effectively.

**Example: Task Management Scope**

**Folder: Scopes**
- **File: Task Management.md**

**Content for `Task Management.md`**:

```markdown
# Task Management Scope

## Overview
This scope represents the task management system, integrating various external tools for managing tasks efficiently.

## Related Systems
- [Task Management System](../Systems/Task%20Management%20System.md)

## External Implementations
1. **Apple Reminders**
   - Used for tracking daily and weekly tasks.
   - Tasks are synced from Obsidian using the TaskPaper format.
2. **Trello**
   - Used for project management and collaboration.
   - Boards are organized based on tasks from the Task Management System.

## Integration Points
1. **Apple Reminders Integration**
   - Export tasks from Obsidian using TaskPaper format.
   - Use [TaskPaper plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins) to facilitate syncing.
2. **Trello Integration**
   - Link Trello boards in this file.
   - Example: [Project Board](https://trello.com/b/projectboard).

## Usage Instructions
- **Adding Tasks**: Add tasks in Obsidian, then sync to Apple Reminders.
- **Project Management**: Update project progress in Trello, ensuring it reflects in the Task Management System in Obsidian.
```

#### Time Rooms

**Definition**: Specific timeframes encapsulating activities and tasks to ensure systematic progress and review.

**Content**:
1. **Overview**:
	- Purpose of the Time Room.
	- Frequency and duration (e.g., Daily, Weekly).
2. **Scheduled Tasks and Activities**:
	- Tasks from Scopes, detailed with due dates.
	- Log of completed tasks and progress.
3. **Review and Adjustments**:
	- End-of-period review notes.
	- Adjustments to plans and systems based on progress.

**Example: Weekly Time Room**

**Folder: Time Rooms**
- **File: Weekly.md**

**Content for `Weekly.md`**:

```markdown
# Weekly Time Room

## Overview
Tracks activities and progress on a weekly basis, integrating tasks from various Scopes.

## Scheduled Tasks and Activities
- **Task Management**: Review tasks in Apple Reminders.
  - Monday: 6 PM - Run 5 km (linked from [Weekly Execution Plan](../Scopes/Weekly%20Execution%20Plan.md))
  - Wednesday: 6 PM - Strength training (linked from [Weekly Execution Plan](../Scopes/Weekly%20Execution%20Plan.md))
  - Friday: 6 PM - Yoga class (linked from [Weekly Execution Plan](../Scopes/Weekly%20Execution%20Plan.md))

## Progress Log
- **Week 1**:
  - Completed: Run 5 km (Monday)
  - Pending: Strength training (Wednesday)
  - Adjustments: Modify running route

## Review and Adjustments
- **Weekly Review**: Assess task completion and overall progress.
  - What went well?
  - What needs improvement?
  - Adjust next weekâ€™s tasks accordingly.
```

### Integration Workflow

1. **Areas**: Define broad categories to structure your focus areas.
2. **Plans**: Detail goals, tasks, and research in Markdown files within Obsidian.
3. **Systems**: Develop structured methods from Plans and document them in Markdown files within Obsidian.
4. **Scopes**:
	- Create Markdown files with overviews and external implementation details.
	- Integrate task management software (e.g., Apple Reminders) and project management tools (e.g., Trello) by linking and describing their usage.
	- Ensure that each Scope file includes instructions for adding tasks and syncing with external tools.

5. **Schemas**:
	- Use diagrams and flowcharts to visualize relationships between Areas, Plans, Systems, and Scopes.
	- Embed these visualizations within Markdown files to maintain a holistic view.

6. **Time Rooms**:
	- Schedule and log tasks and activities from Scopes.
	- Use Time Rooms for regular reviews and adjustments.
	- Sync tasks from Scopes to Time Rooms and external task management tools.

### Practical Example

1. **Define Areas**: Health, Work, Personal Development.
2. **Detail Plans**: Create a detailed exercise routine in `Exercise Routine.md`.
3. **Develop Systems**: Organize these plans into a structured weekly workout schedule in `Weekly Workout Schedule.md`.
4. **Implement Scopes**:
	- **Task Management.md**: Document how tasks are managed using Apple Reminders and Trello.
	- Sync tasks by exporting them from Obsidian to Apple Reminders using TaskPaper format.
	- Manage projects in Trello and link boards in the Scope file.

5. **Visualize with Schemas**: Create a `Health Schema.md` file with diagrams showing how the exercise routine and nutrition plan connect with the weekly workout schedule and execution plan.
6. **Schedule with Time Rooms**: Use `Weekly.md` to track the weekly execution of tasks from the `Weekly Execution Plan`, logging progress and adjusting based on reviews.

By setting up your system this way, you ensure that everything is documented and organized within Obsidian, while still leveraging external tools for task management and visualization. This method maintains the autonomy of your productivity system within Obsidian while effectively integrating external platforms for enhanced functionality.
