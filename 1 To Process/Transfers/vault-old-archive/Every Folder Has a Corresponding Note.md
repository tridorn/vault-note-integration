# Every Folder Has a Corresponding Note

## Introduction

Every folder exists to serve a certain purpose, this is why every folder can also have a note that caters to this very purpose. 

## Exposition

[[Breadcrumbs in Note-Taking System]] exists to create hierarchical structures of [[Concepts]], getting broader when moving up the hierarchy and vice versa. Folders are also based on similar lines of thinking, although ranging from [[Administration in Categorisation System]] that is focussed on meta work of the current system, over [[Projects in Categorisation System]] that holds probably the most actionable files of the whole [[Categorisation System]], reference files related to [[Projects in Task System]], over [[Areas in Categorisation System]] (gradation in actionability from projects, holding reference files of [[Areas in Task System]]), over [[Resources in Categorisation System]] which is the main storage of reference files and also the most though out one in terms of general structure, finally to [[Archive in Categorisation System]].  
This is just to show that folders don’t have a singular purpose, they all serve some however. 

This “folder note” - I would not really limit the here proposed notes to this term, they are created in conjunction with folders but e.g. in Ressources they go beyond simply being appendixes of a folder and more standalone - can come in various forms, while it might be more focussed on practical applications in projects, it migh be a more general overview in areas, and even pretty grand and integrated in Ressources.
