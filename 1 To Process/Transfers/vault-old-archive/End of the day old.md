# End of the day old

## Definition

The start of the day is a complementing structure next to [[Start of the day old]] and [[Conclusion of the day old]] that is intended to repeat and deepen the knowledge and retrieval of the things learned. It ends the learning day, mainly via completing all the new and due cards in [[Anki]].

## Concept

It amounts to one hour and is always placed before the conclusion of the day. 

The regular schedule is from 19:30 to 20:30, the location in the day can vary, depending on the last freely available time before the conclusion of the day. This means, if there is an appointment at the end of the day and no time available after before the conclusion of the day, it is moved to an earlier time. If the appointment also crosses into the territory of the conclusion of the day, the conclusion gets moved from the regular 20:30 to 21:30 to 21:30 to 22:30 and swimming gets removed. If now in this case there is some free time between the appointment and the new time of the conclusion of the day, this should be filled with further learning Anki.  
To reiterate: The end of the day is always the last thing before the conclusion of the day (except only for appointments) and gets moved accordingly if the the conclusion of the day does.

The new cards are only on the status of yesterday, as new Anki cards are created only at the conclusion of the day. The reason for this is that while during the day there is constant shift in the content of the files that would be transferred to Anki. As the conclusion of the day marks the last action of the day, there is also some safety in the cards being "final". Of course, this changes when on eg. the next day there is change in the file once again, not yet represented in the Anki file. This is why every card that got edited during the day is moved to the Inbox. At the conclusion of the day then, the new cards are created in Anki and already existing cards are updated.

The time of learning some time before [[Sleep]] (and in the [[Forbidden Zone of Sleep]]) is also to utilize the brain structure and that knowledge and information get organized and sorted by the brain while in the sleep state

## Process

1. Learn the first half of Anki due/new (25m)
2. Learn the second half of Anki due/new (25m)
