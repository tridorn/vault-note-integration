1. **Know the [[Margin Requirement]] before placing orders[^1]**:  
Margin is not deducted from the [[Free Margin]] for [[Pending Order]]s until it is filled. Calculate the [[Required Margin]] of all unfilled orders and ensure you don't cross the [[Margin Call Level]].   
2. **Use [[Stop Loss Order]]s or [[Trailing Stop]]s**[^1]
3. **Scale in positions rather than entering all at once[^1]**:  
Instead of opening one big position, enter an amount of smaller positions. This means the risk is more spread out and if the price moves in your favor you can adjust different stop loss levels or even lock in profits.
