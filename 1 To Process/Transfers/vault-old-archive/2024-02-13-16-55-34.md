# Scenario Godly Village

--- 

## List

- Secluded village, possibly cut off from the rest of the world by means like magic.
- Inhabited by godlike people, everyone is as the top of their respective game
- Young boy grows up as a warrior, strongest ever seen and top of his clique
- Childhood female friend, in constant battle with her for the top
- Flow of time slower, people themselves aging slower and can renew their life in someway in the village
- Coming-of-age isn't shared with younglings, as it means getting thrown out in the world with no set goal (told beforehand), but all want to come back to the village. The goal thus may be implicit to get strong enough to find a way back to the village (which is, to reiterate, somehow cut off from the world)
- Boy starts a journey to become the strongest, and return to the village, but especially fond his childhood friend which he is destined to meet on the battlefield on opposing sides some way down the road
- Young boy looks ridiculously beautiful, is the strongest, and innocent in personality as he grew up in a small circle
- Boy experiences various adventures and travels the world
- Boy has affinity for lightning (electricity), and water (inspiration "knight of the storm", and Zeus)
- He can swim and breathe under water (transform into a different form), his best performance and hapiness in general is in dark, stormy, rainy weather or the water itself
- His personality on the other hand is like the first sun rays after a storm, cheerful and happy
- His associated colours are blue and silver
- Girl has affinity for fire. Inspiration artillery
- Her personality is firy (she also has red hair to match)
- Her associated colors are red (and [?])
- everybody of the godly village in the outside world is cursed not to recognise each other
- Both boy and girl are extremely impressive in offensive magic (kind of in an equilibrium), but very much less so in defensive magic
- Boy is more powerful in storm and water (can call forth storm
- He can use advantageous elements (say, shoot lightning from the clouds), but is normally more restricted, especially to his body (say only being able to shoot lightning from his body)

## Scene Atom Light

- Kesselschlacht, kingdom of boy has lured kingdom of girl into a trap and decimated their army in a umschlossenen Terrain (Kessel, umrandet von Klippen)
- Boy is rising magic officer and watching with king from one of the cliffs
- Army of kingdom of girl more or less dead, only remnants getting cleaned
- However army of boy now concentrated in Kessel
- Girl walks forth on other side of the Kessel as a lone person
- Boy sees girl and thinks something is odd
- Lends Feldstecher and looks at rising power levels
- He keeps watching her and the levels keep surging and surging
- Gets more worried by the second 
- says "fuck, fuck, fuck" (he normally never swears) and tells chief of army to order a full on assault on the lone magician, right now with everyone available. Chief of army is speechless and confused, he was just winning
- Suddenly, in reaction to the words and as a mean to not hinder the plans of the kingdom of girl, spy's, planted by the kingdom of girl in the ranks of the officer corps reveal themselves by killing the chief of the army and in general trying to cause mayhem
- Boy kills them fast
- Once order once again is restored, boy turns to lone caster again with Feldstecher. The longer he looks, the more he is worried, energy levels are continuing to rise (says, extremely worried, "no, no, no", normally nothing can bring him out of his Fassung)
- He abandons his general sentiment of hiding his true powers and starts floating up and beyond the cliff edge and starting to cast a variety of own spells, attacking the lone caster (girl)
- All attacks get repelled
- boy narrowly deflects a counter attack
- Lands in a hurry back at the officer corps and tells them to order a retreat immediately
- Turns around again and casts a final spell which r√ºckkoppels every kind of magic attack close to it, matching it power. This means it will also hit the friendly magicians, firing at the caster and as such is a verzweifelter act, but it might hit back at the lone caster with whatever he is brewing
- Magic levels have been surging the entire time, a massive, massive speed is on its way
- Boy turns to king and says "your majesty, we have to leave, right now"
- His armour forms around him, and talking to the others, in a deep, metallic voice "run, run for your life. It is every man for himself. Run, if you want to live"
- Everyone looks at him confused and the guards of kings walk forward
- Boy chants a menacingly sounding spell which will create a thunderstorm, his advantageous element. It takes time to form however
- Boy kills the guards fast and grabs the king
- Starts to fly away, dark clouds start to loom on the horizon, boy directly fly in their direction
- Scene view is fixed to the height of human watching. Views from close by how the boy grabs the kings, to the right is the Kessel, to the left is the coming storm (not visible yet). Boy grabs kings and starts to fly. Camera is still fixed and follows boys path. Entire scene now has a dark tone, one can hear the thunder and rain and still the sound of the fight and explosions, as well as breathingand shaking of the camera (the view is indeed from a person). The clouds get bigger and bigger, and suddenly, silence. The clouds are lit brightly, the camera turns and the view is now of the Kessel and the atomic Pilz forming. Still silence, die a few seconds marvelling at the scene and suddenly howling of the storm, rain, everything turns dark, scene cut.
