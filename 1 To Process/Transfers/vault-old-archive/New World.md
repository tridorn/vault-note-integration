## World Description

Version 1  
My own formulation:

I am in the process of forming a fantasy world. The world itself is ridiculously big, multiple times the size of the earth, with endless differences. The history of the world starts, when multiple different races are created at the very same time, but with only limited population and starting with nothing other than themselves. Every race has different properties, different strengths and different desired living environments. Some e.g. have a bigger population and are more fertile but there is less value on the individual, some may be more warlike, some more industrious, some more connected to nature, but all factors and traits combined makes every race (in strength) about similar to each other race, forming a balance at least at the start. This whole concept is similar to when starting in a video game where there is a map to be settled and multiple players compete with races of about similar stats.  
The focus lays on one race, they are extremely low in population, but extremely value individuals. Their body (avatar) that of minerals but formed to great beauty and humanoid design, their mind is "magic". A flow of magic determines the personality and mind of every individual (to signify this: their mind is not centered in a brain like humans for example, but rather truly only composed of magic). They do not necessarily have to inhibit their bodies, but their mind can flow freely through the mineralized magic that their bodies are also composed of. There are many magic lines beneath the ground, and with time these magic lines have crystallized (this is a problematic spot, that the minerals are crystallized magic. I want the magic to be only conducted via the minerals but the minerals themselves being mineralized magic seems not so elegant). Everywhere these lines cross they break through the ground and form a huge mountain (the concept of this is absolutely similar to the lonely mountain in lord of the rings). As previously said, the mind of this race can basically traverse the mineralized magic freely, that means they can go through the magic lines and to the mountains (let us call them insulars) freely and are thus at their strongest there, but if they want to leave and walk the rest of the world they have to use their avatars. Nevertheless, in reality individuals if this race stay in their bodies. The insulars are also ridiculously huge, but pale in comparison to the the rest of the world and thus the territory covered by them is relatively small (relative to the world). This race starts at the biggest confluence of these magic lines, right at the center of the insular with one entity. They are are at their strongest (without question) in the insulars and thus try to occupy all of them around the world, their territory thus is not one single coherent one, next to next, but rather dots sprinkled. They can multiply by forging new individuals from the magic. This is a ridiculously resource and skill intensive task and thus they also multiply fairly slow, another factor contributing the valuation of the individual. The individuals can use the magic to perform a variety of tasks, but they can only use the magic their mind is made up of, they can extend this by extending their mind (maybe learning) new magic, thus altering (more of maturing) their mind/personality and adding to what magic they can use (I am unsure on the point as to how they grow or extend their abilities). New individuals of the race are not shaped to only one form. They can be formed to be most fluent in certain tasks, such as warfare etc. The individuals there are not necessarily limited to what they are designed to be, it is rather that in the process of formation that is the tool cabinet they were provided with, they can develop into any direction just as every other one (once again the problem as to how they develop/grow). The societal structure is wholly different to that of humans. Every individual is an extreme individual, but that not not mean they are solitary or unsocial, but also not social in the context of humans, where each and everyone exists next to each with with their own emotions, thoughts etc. and one can only try to guess the state of others through communication and be as close to being not alone by creating a family or friendships. The individuals of this race (while being individuals) can fuse their minds and live up to the word community by directly connecting or being around others. When they are at the magic lines and close to other individuals their minds come closer to each others and surround each other (similar to two colors that are mixed when close but also can be separated into their single color once again when leaving). They also do not have an economy similar to that of humans, they can be described as more communist (internal or in between members of this race). Everyone owns everything, the big difference to humans and as to how this works is their minds, they are basically one single structure with individual minds. They act as one single organism where every single individual tries to fulfill existing needs (these needs and everything else is communicated via their minds, this means that the flow of these needs and knowledge in general can happen freely at least in between the magic line and insulars, but beyond individuals in their avatars would have to be close to communicate it), these needs can be anything, from coal for furnaces to stone for buildings, to jewelry. This means they can be seen as basically one company which integrates limitless vertically and horizontally. This whole "trying to fulfill every arising need" means that externally (not to other individuals of their race but rather in general, for example to other races) they are trying to act economically to s maximum, streaking every business deal they can, giving out loans, building trading companies, factories, erecting whole towns and kingdoms to funnel everything back to their insulars. They basically try to extract value from the whole world to bring to their homes. The insulars, as made of crystallized magic, can be magically altered that they lead from one surface to another surface of this crystallized magic, effectively creating portals. The insulars can be connected like this so that it seems like eg. one seamless big room even tho it is two rooms of two insulars on two side of the world connected.

Version 2  
Formulation of Chat-GPT (GPT-4):

Part 1: The World and The Crystallines

In a world unimaginably larger than our Earth, a unique array of races thrives, each distinct, balanced in strength, and equipped with their own particular traits. Competition and cooperation occur naturally, resulting in a dynamic, ever-changing world.

One of these races, the Crystallines, is especially fascinating. Their physical forms are beautifully crafted from magical minerals, a humanoid design that exudes elegance and power. But their bodies are merely vessels for their true nature: their minds are composed entirely of magic. This magical consciousness can exist within their bodies or travel freely through the crystalline structures that make up their physical form.

The Crystallines are few in number, but each one is a force to be reckoned with. Their creation is a complex, resource-heavy process involving magic, making each individual incredibly valuable. Therefore, the Crystallines' population growth is slow, further emphasizing the significance of each individual.

The world beneath them is laced with magical lines, like a network of energy veins. Wherever these lines intersect, they break through the ground, forming colossal mountains composed of crystallized magic, known as Insulars. These Insulars act as the Crystallines' homelands, the places where they are most powerful and where they draw magic to create new individuals. Despite their enormous size, these Insulars are scattered across the world, making the Crystallines' territories appear as isolated points in the vast world.

The magic lines and the Insulars are not just power sources for the Crystallines; they are also pathways for their minds. A Crystalline mind can traverse these magical conduits, moving freely from one Insular to another. This ability to move through the crystallized magic gives the Crystallines a unique level of freedom and connectivity, allowing their minds to exist beyond the confines of their physical forms.

Part 2: The Society and Culture of the Crystallines

Crystalline society is a marvel of individuality and communal living. Each Crystalline, while a unique entity with its own personality, can seamlessly fuse their mind with others, creating a vibrant, interconnected community. This mind fusion is not a loss of individuality; rather, it is an expression of unity and mutual understanding, like the intermingling of colors that can still be separated into their individual hues.

Their societal structure is unlike any human societal concept. Each Crystalline contributes to the community by addressing any arising needs, be it material resources, knowledge, or skills. This communal sharing and contribution create an internal structure reminiscent of communism, where everyone owns everything, and every need is communally addressed.

Communication among Crystallines is also unique, enabled by their magical minds. Information, thoughts, and needs flow freely among them when they are near the magical lines or in the Insulars. This network of minds functions as a living, breathing repository of shared experiences and knowledge, enabling them to function as a single organism striving for collective prosperity.

Despite their individuality, Crystallines are not solitary beings. Their society is founded on a profound sense of community, facilitated by their ability to connect minds. This unity allows them to empathize deeply with each other, sharing experiences and emotions in a way that transcends traditional communication methods.

Crystallines are also able to alter the Insulars magically, creating portals that interconnect different Insulars. This ability turns their scattered territories into a seamless network of interconnected spaces, further unifying their society despite the vast geographical distances.

Part 3: The Crystallines' External Relations and Resource Management

Externally, the Crystallines are a formidable economic and industrial force. They engage in business, finance, and industry, not out of necessity for personal wealth, but to channel resources back to their Insulars. The Crystallines establish companies, factories, trading networks, and even banks to achieve this, all to maximize the flow of resources back to their homelands.

Their business ventures are not limited to their own kind. They engage in trade with other races, striking deals, offering loans, and harnessing every opportunity to accumulate resources. The Crystallines' economic endeavors span the entire world, making them a prominent player in the world's economy.

Despite their global economic activities, their ultimate goal remains the prosperity of their homelands. They funnel resources from all their activities back to the Insulars, using their magic to transport these resources instantly through the portals they create. This approach allows them to maintain their scattered territories, ensuring they remain resource-rich despite their geographical dispersion.

Their impressive economic tactics and resource management strategies, combined with their internal communal structure, make the Crystallines a unique race. They balance their individuality and communal living with their external economic activities, creating a harmonious society that thrives amidst the world's diversity and vastness.

(Part 4: The Evolution and Individuality of the Crystallines) (unofficial)

The Crystallines are not static beings; they evolve, learn, and grow, both individually and as a society. Each individual's mind, being composed of magic, is capable of expanding its knowledge and understanding. As they learn new magic, they mature, their personalities subtly shifting and deepening. This process of growth is not just an accumulation of power but also an enriching of their individual identities.

In their creation, new Crystallines are not limited to a single form or purpose. They can be shaped to excel in certain tasks, such as warfare, trade, or magic. However, this initial 'toolkit' does not limit their future development. Like a seed that can grow into a tree, each Crystalline has the potential to evolve in any direction, their growth guided by their experiences and interactions with their kin and the world at large.

Despite the initial design, every Crystalline has the potential to explore beyond their given attributes, embodying the communal belief in unlimited potential and individual growth. This flexibility in individual development contributes to the diversity within their society, allowing for a vibrant range of skills, knowledge, and personalities.

Their evolution is not just an individual endeavor. As they grow and learn, they share their experiences and knowledge with the rest of their kin, contributing to the collective wisdom of their society. This exchange of knowledge and experiences enriches their shared consciousness, fostering communal growth alongside individual evolution.

In conclusion, the Crystallines are a harmonious blend of individuality and community, of internal growth and external expansion. Their society is a testament to the beauty of unity in diversity, the strength in shared consciousness, and the potential in each individual. They stand as a beacon of balanced growth and communal prosperity amidst the world's endless diversity.

## Further Concepts

1. **Establishing Other Races:** In order to create a more robust world, it would be beneficial to flesh out the other races that inhabit this world. What are their strengths, weaknesses, and societal structures? How do they view the Crystallines, and how do these relationships change over time?
2. **Historical Events:** You could map out significant events that have influenced the trajectory of the Crystallines and the other races. Wars, alliances, betrayals, natural disasters, magical phenomena, and technological advancements could all play a role in shaping the world's history.
3. **Cultural Exchange:** As the Crystallines interact with other races, there will be inevitable cultural exchange. They might adopt certain customs, technologies, or tactics from other races, and vice versa. This could enrich the Crystallines' culture and affect their development.
4. **Internal Conflicts:** Just like the Roman Republic had its patricians and plebeians, the Crystallines could have their own internal disputes, despite their communal nature. Disagreements might arise over resource allocation, expansion strategies, interactions with other races, or the role of the individual versus the community.
5. **Magical Development:** As the Crystallines grow and learn, their understanding and usage of magic could evolve. This could lead to magical breakthroughs that change their society in significant ways. It could also lead to magical mishaps or disasters that set them back.
6. **Power Dynamics:** The Crystallines, despite their formidable individual power, start with a disadvantage in numbers. How they navigate power dynamics with more populous races could be a central theme of the narrative.
7. **Exploration and Conquest:** Similar to Rome's expansion from a small city-state to a vast empire, the Crystallines could gradually spread their influence across the world. Each new insular they colonize could present unique challenges and opportunities, shaping their civilization in different ways.
8. **Resistance and Backlash:** As the Crystallines extend their reach and amass power, they could face resistance from other races who view them as a threat. This could lead to conflicts, alliances, and political maneuvering.
9. **Heroic Figures and Leaders:** Just as figures like Caesar and Augustus were pivotal in Rome's history, individuals could significantly shape the Crystallines' society. These could be great leaders, innovators, warriors, or even traitors.
10. **Philosophical and Ethical Questions:** The Crystallines' unique communal structure and their relationship with magic could give rise to philosophical and ethical debates. These could revolve around individuality, the nature of consciousness, the ethics of their economic practices, and the balance between communal and individual needs.
