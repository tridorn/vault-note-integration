# Inbox in Task System

## Definition

Inbox in task system is the theoretical concept to capture and categorise anything ([[Stuff]]).

## Comparison

While inbox in task system refers to theory and the ground model, [[Inbox in Categorisation System]] serves the implementation and location.

## Exposition

An inbox can essentially be anything that is able to capture “stuff” (see [[Getting Things Done|GTD]]). It is important to put everything that you want to act upon or might be unsure about. Every open loop has to be tossed into the inbox to await processing. At opportune times, in the context of the [[2023-12-30-17-57-04]] at predefined times, that is in accordance with [[Time Plan System]] every half an hour session, this inbox is then processed. Every item in the inbox (no matter what form the inbox might have) is looked at and then categorised based on predefined steps.

## Process

1. Stuff is in the inbox.
2. What is it?
3. Is it actionable?
4. If no
	1. Trash
	2. [[Reference in Task System]]
	3. [[Someday-Maybe in Task System]]
5. If yes
	1. What’s the next action?
	2. Will it take less that 2 minutes?
	3. If yes
		1. Do it
	4. If no
		1. [[Waiting For in Task System]]
		2. [[Calendar in Task System]]
		3. [[Next Actions in Task System]]
