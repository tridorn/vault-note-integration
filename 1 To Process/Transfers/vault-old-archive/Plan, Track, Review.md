Include any relevant background information that informs the goals or tasks for this time frame. This might include reflections on the previous time frame or general conditions that will influence the period you're planning for.

### Goals (Definition)

Define each of your goals for the time frame in a clear, measurable way. Break down larger goals into smaller sub-goals as necessary.

### Tasks (List)

Create a list of specific tasks that will help you achieve each goal. If a task is large or complex, consider breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts.
