The **Leadership Council** is the strategic **brain trust** of the company, responsible for defining the **long-term vision**, setting the **high-level strategy**, and ensuring that the company moves in alignment with its goals while maintaining the **adaptive, decentralized structure** that empowers the **Adaptive Mission Units (AMUs)** and other teams to function independently. As the company scales, the Leadership Council becomes the key body that coordinates strategy, makes pivotal decisions, and fosters growth.

### **What Is the Leadership Council?**

The **Leadership Council** consists of **senior leaders**, each responsible for a specific strategic domain within the company. Unlike a traditional C-suite where decisions flow from a single CEO downwards, the Leadership Council embodies a more **collaborative approach** to leadership, reflecting the company’s decentralized and autonomous nature.

The council is made up of individuals who are each tasked with:

- **Overseeing a critical function** (such as Vision, Strategy, Technology, Operations, People, or Finance).
- **Translating the high-level vision into specific, actionable objectives** for their respective domains.
- Ensuring the **alignment of operational activities** (through AMUs, Operational Command Divisions, and LFOs) with the company’s broader goals.
- **Monitoring performance**, adjusting the strategic direction based on real-time data from the **Intelligence Command Centre**, and maintaining **cross-functional cohesion**.

3. **Iterative Review and Feedback:**
	- The Council meets regularly to **review performance metrics** (from the Intelligence Command Centre) and receives feedback from **LFOs and AMUs**. This allows the Council to **course-correct** when necessary, ensuring that strategy remains aligned with the dynamic market environment.
