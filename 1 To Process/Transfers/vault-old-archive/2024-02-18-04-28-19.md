# Use Less Catch-all Types and More Unique Headings

---

## What Are Catch-all Types?

Catch-all types (like Exposition, Analysis, even the here-used elaboration) and the main type of a note are the most strict implementation of the note-taking system. They however limit the variety of portrayable content and logical sequencing. The whole content the note references the title and the concept as such. Instead of segmenting the content of the note or really paying any mind to what actually is captured, catch-alls are a place to dump anything and everything.

## What to Do Instead?

Use the general types, like introduction, definition, structure when applicable, but when developing the note and its content otherwise use headings that are formed around the specifics of the note. Just like in this note.
