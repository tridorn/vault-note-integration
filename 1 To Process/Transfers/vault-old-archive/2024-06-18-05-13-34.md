In the "What I Achieved" section, you should write an honest account of what you actually did during the timeframe, regardless of whether it aligns with your initial objective or not. This section is meant to reflect reality, both positive and negative aspects, to provide a clear picture of your productivity and help you learn from your experiences.

### Example Documentation

#### Before the Timeframe

**Objective**: Draft the introduction section of the client presentation.

**Expected Outcome**: Completed draft of the introduction section, ready for review.

#### After the Timeframe

**What I Achieved**:
- Watched a video for 20 minutes.
- Started drafting the introduction but only managed to write a few sentences.

**Reflections**:
- **Distractions**: Realized that I got distracted by watching a video, which significantly reduced my productivity.
- **Focus Improvement**: Need to create a distraction-free environment for the next session.
- **Time Management**: Plan to use a timer to stay on track during the next timeframe.

### Guidelines for the "What I Achieved" Section

1. **Be Honest**:
	- Record what you actually did, including any deviations from the planned tasks.
	- Example: "Watched a video for 20 minutes."

2. **Include Both Positive and Negative Aspects**:
	- Note both accomplishments and shortcomings.
	- Example: "Started drafting the introduction but only managed to write a few sentences."

3. **Be Specific**:
	- Provide specific details about what you did, even if it's not related to the objective.
	- Example: "Watched a documentary on productivity instead of working on the presentation."

### Reflections Section

1. **Analyze Distractions**:
	- Reflect on why you got distracted and how it affected your productivity.
	- Example: "Realized that I got distracted by watching a video, which significantly reduced my productivity."

2. **Identify Areas for Improvement**:
	- Suggest strategies to avoid similar distractions in the future.
	- Example: "Need to create a distraction-free environment for the next session."

3. **Adjust Plans**:
	- Adjust your approach or environment to improve focus for the next timeframe.
	- Example: "Plan to use a timer to stay on track during the next timeframe."

### Example Scenario: Unproductive Timeframe

#### Before the Timeframe

**Objective**: Draft the introduction section of the client presentation.

**Expected Outcome**: Completed draft of the introduction section, ready for review.

#### After the Timeframe

**What I Achieved**:
- Spent 20 minutes watching a video on YouTube.
- Drafted only a couple of sentences for the introduction.

**Reflections**:
- **Distraction**: Watching the video took up a significant portion of the timeframe.
- **Need for Better Focus**: Recognize the need to minimize distractions; consider setting specific rules for working time.
- **Next Steps**: Set up a dedicated workspace free from distractions and use a focus timer app to help stay on track in the next session.

By documenting both what you planned to do and what you actually did, you create a transparent record of your productivity. This helps you understand patterns in your work habits, recognize potential distractions, and make informed adjustments to improve future performance.
