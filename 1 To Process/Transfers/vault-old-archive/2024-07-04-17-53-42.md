# Naming Convention Structure

We'll use a prefix format that combines letters and numbers to indicate position, category, and qualitative aspects.

**Format: [Position in Local Level][Top-Level Folder][Folder Level][Category/Tag][Priority/Status]**

### Components

1. **Position in Local Level (Number)**: A number indicating the folder's sequence within its current level.
2. **Top-Level Folder (Letter)**: A single letter representing the top-level category (e.g., Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives).
3. **Folder Level (Number)**: A number indicating the depth of the folder within the hierarchy.
4. **Category/Tag (Optional Letter)**: A letter representing a specific sub-category or thematic tag within the top-level category.
5. **Priority/Status (Optional Letter)**: A letter indicating the priority or status of the folder content.

### Example

1. **Projects (P)**
	- **Sub-Category: Development (D), Testing (T), Design (G)**
	- **Priority: High (H), Medium (M), Low (L)**
	- **Status: Completed (C), Ongoing (O)**

2. **Areas (A)**
	- **Sub-Category: Marketing (M), Sales (S), Operations (O)**
	- **Priority: High (H), Medium (M), Low (L)**
	- **Status: Active (A), Inactive (I)**

3. **Resources (R)**
	- **Sub-Category: Articles (A), Books (B), Tools (T)**
	- **Priority: High (H), Medium (M), Low (L)**
	- **Status: Reviewed (R), Unreviewed (U)**

4. **Archives (X)**
	- **No additional sub-categories or priority/status required as they are less actively managed.**

### Examples of Folder Names

1. **Projects:**
	- `1P1-DH`: First project folder, top-level project, first level, Development category, High priority.
	- `2P2-TM`: Second project folder, top-level project, second level, Testing category, Medium priority.
	- `3P1-GC`: Third project folder, top-level project, first level, Design category, Completed status.

2. **Areas:**
	- `1A1-MS`: First area folder, top-level area, first level, Marketing sub-category, Sales focus.
	- `2A2-SO`: Second area folder, top-level area, second level, Sales sub-category, Operations focus.

3. **Resources:**
	- `1R1-AR`: First resource folder, top-level resource, first level, Articles sub-category, Reviewed status.
	- `2R2-BU`: Second resource folder, top-level resource, second level, Books sub-category, Unreviewed status.

4. **Archives:**
	- `1X1`: First archive folder, top-level archive, first level.
	- `2X2`: Second archive folder, top-level archive, second level.

### Implementation Guide

1. **Define Top-Level Categories**: Clearly define your top-level categories (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives).
2. **Create Sub-Categories**: For each top-level category, define relevant sub-categories or thematic tags.
3. **Set Priority/Status Indicators**: Decide on letters for priority and status indicators relevant to your work.
4. **Document Naming Conventions**: Create a document explaining the naming conventions, including examples and descriptions of each component.
5. **Consistent Application**: Ensure all users follow the naming conventions consistently for clarity and efficiency.
6. **Review and Adapt**: Periodically review the system to ensure it continues to meet your needs and make adjustments as necessary.

### Benefits

- **Clarity**: The naming convention provides immediate insight into the folder's content, position, and importance.
- **Scalability**: The system can grow with your needs without becoming unwieldy.
- **Flexibility**: Incorporates both hierarchical and categorical/qualitative information, making it versatile for different types of content.
- **Efficiency**: Enhances searchability and organization, saving time and reducing confusion.

By integrating these elements into your PARA framework, you'll have a robust, intuitive, and highly organized system for managing your digital environment.
