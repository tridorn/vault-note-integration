# Decreed or Be it

--- 

## Analysis

Both choices carry a sense of solemnity and finality, making them fitting for use in the context of your constitution and potentially other significant contexts within your personal religion. The choice between the two depends on the tone and emphasis you wish to convey:

1. **"So it is decreed, so it shall be. The Path of Imperius is eternal."**
	 
	 - This option emphasizes the authority and timelessness of your declaration. The words "decreed" and "eternal" suggest that the path you've set is not only a personal commitment but also an unalterable truth that extends beyond the temporal bounds. It carries a more formal and authoritative tone, suggesting that the path is not only chosen but also ordained in some way.
2. **"So be it, on this day, and all days to come."**
	 
	 - This phrase places emphasis on the enduring commitment of the individual. It highlights the ongoing nature of the journey, focusing on the continuous and daily recommitment to the path. This option feels more personal and immediate, as it underscores the individual's active role in perpetuating their dedication every day.

If your intention is to underline the unchanging and predetermined nature of your path, akin to a universal law or decree, the first option may be more suitable. If, however, you want to emphasize your ongoing, active commitment to this path, the second option might be more fitting. Both are powerful in their own right and align well with the epic and profound nature of your personal religion.
