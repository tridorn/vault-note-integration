Your inquiry delves into a critical aspect of organizational management—how to evaluate **individual employee performance** in the context of a **collective mission-based structure** like AMUs, where overall team success often overshadows the contributions of individuals. While **collective success** is paramount in mission-driven systems, individual performance still plays a vital role in sustaining **long-term organizational growth**, **employee development**, and **personal accountability**.

Here’s how individual performance can be **assessed, accounted for**, and aligned with the larger framework of **OKRs, AMUs, and mission success**, balancing the need for both **collective and individual achievement**.

---

### **1. The Role of Individual Performance in Collective Success**

While the AMU system prioritizes the **success of missions** as a team effort, individual contributions are still essential for:

- **Ensuring quality**: The quality of individual work impacts the overall success of the mission. Even if the mission is completed, a **poor individual contribution** may affect the quality of the outcomes.
- **Sustaining long-term growth**: Evaluating individual performance ensures that employees are **growing, learning, and improving**—key factors in the company’s long-term success.
- **Accountability and leadership development**: Holding individuals accountable for their specific roles within a mission builds **trust, ownership, and leadership capacity**.

Thus, **individual performance** does matter, but it must be framed within the **context of the mission** and tied back to how it enables the **team’s overall success**.

---

### **2. Metrics for Individual Performance in an AMU-Based System**

Since AMU success is the primary goal, individual performance should be measured by how well **each team member contributes to the mission** and how their work aligns with the **objectives** set out for their role.

#### **A. Role-Specific Key Results (RSKRs)**

- Each individual within an AMU should have **Role-Specific Key Results (RSKRs)** tied to the larger **AMU objectives**. These are specific outcomes that reflect their **personal accountability** within the team.
  
  - Example: If an AMU is tasked with launching a new product, the **content writer’s RSKR** could be to deliver 10 high-quality articles, while the **UX designer’s RSKR** could be to complete the design prototypes by a certain date.

- These RSKRs should be:
  - **Clear and measurable**: Each team member should know exactly what they are accountable for.
  - **Time-bound**: Deadlines should align with the overall mission timeline.
  - **Tied to mission outcomes**: The individual’s success directly contributes to the team’s overall success.

#### **B. Peer and Team Evaluations**

- Since AMU success is a team effort, **peer reviews** can provide a balanced evaluation of an individual’s **collaborative skills**, **communication**, and **teamwork**—elements that are often missed in pure metrics-based assessments.

- **Peer reviews** could be conducted:
  - **Mid-mission**: Offering feedback on collaboration and problem-solving.
  - **Post-mission**: Providing a broader review of how well the individual contributed to the mission’s success.

#### **C. 360-Degree Feedback**

- To capture a more holistic view of performance, implement **360-degree feedback**, which includes:
  - **Input from peers** (within the AMU).
  - **Feedback from the LFO** overseeing the AMU.
  - **Self-assessment** by the employee.
  - **Client feedback** (if applicable), especially for client-facing roles.

This method ensures a **well-rounded perspective** on how each individual is performing in relation to others and the overall mission.

### **3. Balancing Collective and Individual Success**

#### **A. Mission Success as the Primary Driver**

- If an AMU **achieves its mission**—successfully meeting the **Key Results** and **OKRs**—this should be a **positive reflection on the entire team**. However, even in cases of success, it’s crucial to understand the **specific role each individual played**.
  
- The **AMU mission success** could be weighted higher in **team-based evaluations**, but individual assessments still ensure that each person remains **accountable** and contributes at the level expected of their role.

#### **B. Evaluating Mission Success and Individual Contributions Separately**

- Consider having two **layers of evaluation**:
  1. **Mission Success**: Evaluates the overall **success of the AMU** in completing its objectives (OKRs, Key Results).
  2. **Individual Performance**: Focuses on how each **team member contributed** to the mission and whether they met their **Role-Specific Key Results** (RSKRs).

Even if the **mission fails**, an individual might excel in their role, which should be recognized. Conversely, a mission can succeed, but if someone didn’t perform well, that discrepancy should be noted and addressed.

---

### **4. Performance Reviews and Development Feedback**

Once individual performance is **tracked** within the context of AMU missions, there needs to be a formal mechanism for **reviewing performance** and providing **development feedback**.

#### **A. Mission Debriefs**

- After each mission, hold a **mission debrief** where the **AMU team, LFO, and leadership** review both the mission's success and each individual’s performance against their **RSKRs**.
  
- In this debrief:
  - The **AMU’s overall success** is discussed first, with a focus on how well the team met its **Key Results**.
  - Then, each **individual’s contribution** is assessed. This can involve:
	 - A presentation or reflection by the individual on how they met their RSKRs.
	 - Feedback from **peers** and **LFOs** on collaboration, leadership, and specific skills.
  
- **Development feedback**: Once the **performance against RSKRs** is evaluated, leadership or LFOs should offer **developmental feedback** on how each individual can improve their skills, collaboration, or role in future missions.

#### **B. Continuous Performance Tracking**

- In addition to **post-mission reviews**, individual performance should be tracked continuously using:
  - **Quarterly check-ins**: Regular feedback sessions between employees and their direct manager or LFO, focusing on **personal growth** and **skill development**.
  - **Skills matrix**: Maintain a **skills tracking system** where employees can assess and update their skills based on mission performance. This creates a sense of **progression** and helps in aligning **future AMU roles** with the right individuals.

---

### **5. Incentives and Recognition**

To further motivate individual performance within a mission-driven structure, it’s important to recognize and reward **outstanding contributions** while also encouraging **team success**.

#### **A. Performance-Based Incentives**

- Introduce **incentives** based on a mix of **team success** and **individual contributions**. For example:
  - **AMU Bonuses**: Reward the entire team if the mission’s **Key Results** are met, but with **additional individual bonuses** for team members who have exceeded their **RSKRs**.
  
- **Recognition programs**: Employees who demonstrate **exceptional performance** within an AMU could receive:
  - **Performance badges** or recognition that is tied to company values (e.g., **"Leadership Excellence"**, **"Innovation Champion"**).
  - **Opportunities for promotion** or **leadership roles** in future AMUs.

#### **B. Aligning Individual Success with Career Growth**

- Frame **individual performance reviews** not just as a judgment of success or failure, but as part of a **growth trajectory** within the company. High performers should have the chance to:
  - **Lead future AMUs**.
  - Take on more **strategic roles** or mentor other team members.
  
- This system ensures that even though the **AMU’s success** is a collective effort, there is still room for **individual growth** and recognition.

---

### **6. Accountability and Improvement**

While recognizing success is important, **accountability** is also crucial for long-term performance improvement.

#### **A. Addressing Underperformance**

- If an individual is consistently **underperforming** within an AMU, this needs to be handled constructively:
  - **Identify the gap**: Use the RSKRs and feedback mechanisms to pinpoint **where** the employee is falling short.
  - **Development plan**: Create a **personal improvement plan** with actionable steps for skill development or behavior change.

#### **B. Performance Tracking Over Multiple Missions**

- **Cumulative performance**: Track individual performance across **multiple AMU missions** to get a fuller picture of their contributions over time. Someone may underperform on one mission but excel in another, so a **holistic view** is important.
  
- **Flagging issues early**: If performance issues persist across multiple missions, this system allows leadership to **identify issues** early and provide additional support or coaching before it becomes a larger problem.

---

### **Conclusion: Balancing Collective and Individual Accountability**

While **mission success** is the primary focus of an AMU-based system, individual performance is still vital to ensure that each person is contributing meaningfully to the collective effort. By implementing **Role-Specific Key Results (RSKRs)**, **360-degree feedback**, and regular **performance reviews**, you can balance the collective nature of AMUs with the **personal growth and accountability** needed for individual development. This ensures that employees not only meet mission goals but also **develop as leaders, collaborators, and innovators**, all while feeling motivated and recognized for their unique contributions.
