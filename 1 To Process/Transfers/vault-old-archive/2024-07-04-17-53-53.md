# File Naming Convention Structure

We'll use a similar prefix format as for folders but add additional elements specific to files, such as version control and date.

**Format: [Position in Local Level][Top-Level Folder][Folder Level][Category/Tag][Priority/Status]-[FileName]-[Version][Date].**

### Components

1. **Position in Local Level (Number)**: The file's sequence within its current folder.
2. **Top-Level Folder (Letter)**: A single letter indicating the top-level category (P, A, R, X).
3. **Folder Level (Number)**: A number showing the depth of the file within the folder structure.
4. **Category/Tag (Optional Letter)**: A letter for a specific sub-category or thematic tag.
5. **Priority/Status (Optional Letter)**: A letter indicating the priority or status of the file content.
6. **FileName**: A descriptive name for the file.
7. **Version (V or numeric)**: This can be a version number or letter to indicate revisions.
8. **Date (YYMMDD)**: Date of creation or last modification.

### Examples of File Names

1. **Projects:**
	- `1P1-DH-ProjectProposal-V2-220301.pdf`: First project file, top-level project, first level, Development category, High priority, second version, dated March 1, 2022.
	- `2P2-TM-TestReport-V3-220305.docx`: Second project file, top-level project, second level, Testing category, Medium priority, third version, dated March 5, 2022.

2. **Areas:**
	- `1A1-MS-MarketingStrategy-220307.xlsx`: First area file, top-level area, first level, Marketing sub-category, Sales focus, dated March 7, 2022.
	- `2A2-SO-SalesReport-220308.xlsx`: Second area file, top-level area, second level, Sales sub-category, Operations focus, dated March 8, 2022.

### Implementation Tips for Files

- **Specificity and Brevity**: While being descriptive, keep file names reasonably brief to ensure they are manageable and readable.
- **Standardization**: Define and use a standardized format across all documents to make the system effective.
- **Documentation**: Document these conventions clearly and provide training if necessary to ensure everyone understands and uses them effectively.
- **Avoid Special Characters**: Stick to alphanumeric characters and simple dashes or underscores to avoid issues with different operating systems.

By extending your structured naming convention to files, you'll create a highly organized digital environment that facilitates quick access and clear understanding of your data across projects, areas, resources, and archives. This approach also aids in backup, archiving, and collaboration, ensuring all team members can find and use documents efficiently.
