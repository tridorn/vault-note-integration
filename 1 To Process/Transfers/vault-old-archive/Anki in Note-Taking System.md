# Anki in Note-Taking System

At first I thought of doing key value pairs for Anki notes, with the different types of a note as the key (of course with the note title also on the frontside) and the corresponding, unchanged text as the value. This would have been easy to maintain as on creation only a simple copy operation would have been sufficient. This approach would have run into some problems in extensive notes where there is a wall of text, maybe even lists and in general way too much for a single Anki card to cover. 

Anki cards are based on and linked to notes. Every Anki card asks a specific question to a specific note. As many notes as possible can be created for any note, the purpose is to repeat and further deepen the key points of that note.
