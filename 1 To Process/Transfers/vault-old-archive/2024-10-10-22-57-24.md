## **Implementing The Structure**

1. **Create the Workspace**

	- Set up your company's Notion workspace, which will contain all teamspaces and content.

2. **Set Up Teamspaces**

	- **Main Teamspace**: Create and set as accessible to all employees.
	- **AMU Teamspaces**: Create a new teamspace for each active AMU.
	- **OCD Teamspaces**: Create teamspaces for each Operational Command Division.
	- **Leadership Teamspace**: Create with restricted access.
	- **Innovation Teamspace**: Create and set access as needed.
	- **Shared Teamspaces**: Create for cross-functional projects.

3. **Populate Teamspaces with Pages and Subpages**

	- Use the structure outlined above to create pages and subpages within each teamspace.
	- Use templates where appropriate to maintain consistency.

4. **Assign Permissions**

	- Control access to each teamspace based on team membership and role.
	- Ensure sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel.

5. **Linking and Navigation**

	- Use links within pages to connect related content across teamspaces.
	- Set up navigation menus or sidebar shortcuts for easy access to key areas.

6. **Maintain and Update Content**

	- Regularly update pages with current information.
	- Archive old content as needed, moving completed AMUs to the Company Archives.

## **Example: Navigating to an AMU's Mission Book**

1. **Workspace** > **AMU-001: Orion Teamspace** (Teamspace)

This structure supports the AMU-based approach while leveraging Notion's capabilities for organization, collaboration, and access control.
