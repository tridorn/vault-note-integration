# Archive in Categorisation System

## Definition

Projects in categorisation system refers to a folder located at the top level and its function in the greater [[Categorisation System]].

## Exposition

The structure of the archive follows a date and letter-based approach. The first layer is the year in which the file was archived and the second layer is the first letter of the file. [[No Further Layer Beyond Year and Letter in Archive]], there are various other systems to ensure findability, especially [[Topic Tags in Categorisation System]] and [[Breadcrumbs in Note-Taking System]], any artificial structure beyond year and letter might just complicate things.

[[Add Archived Property and Tag to Archived Files]], this is primarily relevant to Obsidian and notes, as [[Topic Tags in Categorisation System]] are generally designed to be platform-independent, it should if applicable also assigned to every file.
