# Strictly Separate Categorisation System and Task System into Physical Location and Theoretical Base

---

## Elaboration

Truly and logically sound split categorisation system and task system into provider of the location and the theoretical concept behind it. That means the task system defines the theoretical approach and doesn't yet mention anything regarding the requirements. The categorisation system than analyses the needs and provides the location.

Time has to tell if this strict separation is even needed as one potential problem I see is losing the overview because of too many similar reading notes.
