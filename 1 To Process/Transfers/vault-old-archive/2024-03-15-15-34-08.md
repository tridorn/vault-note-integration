# Add Archived Property and Access & Tag on Archiving of a File

--- 

## Elaboration

On archiving add the current [[Date Time in Categorisation System|date time]] as a property (primarily in Obsidian) and the tag `#archived` (to the fronmatter in Obsidian). Finally set the access to archived. The concern that this overwrites any important access restrictions is unfounded if access to the archive per se is heavily restricted.

While the primary use case, as evident, is Obsidian, the tagging system of [[2024-02-19-14-53-26|Plan Categorisation]] (in the form of [[2024-02-19-17-29-15|Topic Tags]] and [[2024-02-19-16-38-59|Administrative Tags]]) is generally designed to be platform-independent.
