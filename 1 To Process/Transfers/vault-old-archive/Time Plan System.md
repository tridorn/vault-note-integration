# Time Plan System

--- 

## Introduction

The time plan system essentially is a goal-setting mechanism. It sets certain things to be achieved in certain time frames and adds indicators to test if these things were accomplished. It is tightly integrated with the [[Task System]].

## Background

The time plan system, or rather, its origins, can be seen as the "original" productivity system. From around the start I envisioned a system that builds on hierarchical time frames (called Zeiträume, representing a time span between two Zeitpunkten) and defines Ziele (goals) that only exist in these time frames. Ziele where things to do and goals at the same time and consisted of parameters Zeitpunkt start, Zeitpunkt end, completed (there were many iterations, different parameters for example). In some variations Ziele could only "link up" in same type, a Ziel related to health in a higher Zeitraum could only be addressed by a Ziel health in a lower one. With time, the system changed to where Ziele would exist in only one Zeitraum as before, but the Ziele in the lower Zeiträume, who were created to concretise the upper ones didn't need to be of the same type. A Ziel "Become a lawyer" could spawn Ziele like "Do sports", "Finish course A", "Join student organisation x". These are not directly related but may influence the competion of the higher level Ziel
