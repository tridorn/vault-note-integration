# Trading the Bounce

> up:: [[Support and Resistance (board)]]  
> next:: [[Trading the Break]]

- Sell when the price reaches the [[Resistance]]
- Buy when the price reaches the [[Support]]

When trading the Bounce you want to verify that the price really is rebounding from the resistance or support levels. This is why you set your [[Pending Order|Limit Order]] slightly above the support (limit buy) and below the resistance (limit sell). Your [[Stop Loss Order]] is placed beyond the support or resistance.
