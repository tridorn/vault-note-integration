## Definition

A doji is a [[Candlestick Patterns (board)|Candlestick Pattern]] that has a very small box. Basically the same opening and closing prices.[^1]

## General

Dojis signify a struggle for the upper hand between sellers and buyers with no party being dominant.[^1]

When spotting a doji you have to look at the preceding candles. If there was a decisive downtrend for example (and vice versa), a doji might show that the sellers are running out of steam.[^1]

Four special types doji candles:[^1]

1. Long-legged doji (longer lower shadow than upper)
2. Dragonfly doji (no upper shadow, long lower shadow)
3. Gravestone doji (no lower shadow, long upper shadow)
4. Four price doji (no shadows)
