# When to set categories

## Exposition 

Regarding when to set categories, it would depend on your personal preference and the specifics of your workflow. If you feel it would be more beneficial to assign categories ahead of time during your planning stages, then that might work best for you. On the other hand, if your work is more fluid and unpredictable, it might be more practical to assign categories retroactively based on what actually occurred during the session. Ideally, you could have a blend of both, with some sessions being assigned categories ahead of time and others being categorized retroactively.

In general, the flexibility to assign and adjust categories either before or after the session would make your system more adaptable and reflective of your actual work patterns
