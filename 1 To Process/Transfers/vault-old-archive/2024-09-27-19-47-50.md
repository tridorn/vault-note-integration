1 Version 2

You're correct in pointing out that if every **AMU** were directly briefed by the **Leadership Council**, this could become an overwhelming task, particularly in larger organizations with multiple missions underway simultaneously. The **Leadership Council** sets the overall strategic direction, but there are layers in place to ensure that this strategy is effectively communicated without requiring constant direct involvement from the council itself.

Let’s break down how the **briefing** process can be efficiently handled:

### **1. Leadership Council’s Role in Strategic Briefing**

The **Leadership Council** is responsible for defining the **high-level strategy** and key objectives, but they do **not brief every single AMU** directly. Instead, they focus on the following:

- Setting **strategic priorities** and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the company.
- Communicating these priorities to **Leadership Field Officers (LFOs)** and **AMU Leaders**.
- Overseeing progress through **periodic reviews** and updates rather than day-to-day involvement.

#### Key Actions of the Leadership Council

- **Initial Strategic Briefing**: The Leadership Council briefs the **Leadership Field Officers (LFOs)** and select **AMU Leaders** about the **broad company vision**, key objectives, and strategic missions.
- **High-Level Check-ins**: They periodically review overall mission progress, particularly during critical phases, to ensure alignment with broader objectives.

### **2. The Role of Leadership Field Officers (LFOs) in Briefing AMUs**

The **LFOs** serve as a crucial intermediary between the **Leadership Council** and **AMUs**. The LFOs are the ones who usually **brief the AMUs**, making the communication process more manageable. They take the **strategic vision** set by the Leadership Council and translate it into **actionable information** for the AMUs.

#### LFO Briefing Responsibilities

- **Receive Strategic Direction**: LFOs get the strategic overview and objectives directly from the Leadership Council, along with any specific nuances for particular missions.
- **Translate into Operational Terms**: They then translate this strategic direction into **clear, mission-focused briefs** for AMU Leaders, ensuring that each AMU understands how their mission aligns with the company's broader strategy.
- **Initial AMU Briefing**: LFOs brief the AMU Leaders and teams by providing context, setting expectations, and explaining the **KPIs and strategic objectives** associated with their mission.
- **Ongoing Guidance**: LFOs remain in close contact with the AMU Leaders throughout the mission to ensure **strategic alignment** and **assist with any course corrections**.

### **3. AMU Leaders’ Role in Mission Briefing**

Once the **LFOs** brief the AMU Leaders, the **AMU Leaders** are responsible for conducting **internal team briefings** within their unit. These leaders take the strategic guidance and adapt it into an **operational plan** that their AMU can execute.

#### AMU Leader Briefing Responsibilities

- **Internal Team Briefing**: After receiving the strategic direction from the LFO, the AMU Leader briefs the team on the **mission objectives, timeline, and key success factors**. This briefing ensures that all team members understand their role in executing the mission.
- **Translate Strategic Objectives**: The AMU Leader translates the high-level objectives into **operational steps** that the team can take, breaking the mission down into clear tasks.
- **Ongoing Alignment**: The AMU Leader is responsible for ensuring that the team remains aligned with the strategic goals by conducting regular **team updates** and revisiting the **broader mission context** throughout the project.

### **4. Layers of Briefing to Minimize Workload for the Leadership Council**

To avoid overloading the **Leadership Council** with the task of briefing every AMU, the company relies on a **layered communication system**:

- **Leadership Council to LFOs**: The Leadership Council briefs a small group of **Leadership Field Officers (LFOs)** who serve as the communication bridge between the strategic and operational levels.
  
- **LFOs to AMU Leaders**: The LFOs then brief the **AMU Leaders** on the specific missions and strategic priorities. This step ensures that strategic alignment is maintained without requiring the Council to be involved with every mission detail.

- **AMU Leaders to Team Members**: Finally, the AMU Leaders take the mission objectives and break them down into **operational instructions** for the rest of the team, ensuring that everyone understands the mission’s **strategic context**.

### **5. The Efficiency of This Communication System**

By using this **multi-layered communication approach**, the system ensures:

- **Strategic alignment at every level**: The Leadership Council focuses on high-level strategy, while LFOs ensure that AMU Leaders are well-briefed, and AMU Leaders handle the specific operational details with their teams.
- **Reduced communication burden**: The Leadership Council doesn't have to micromanage or constantly interact with every AMU, allowing them to stay focused on guiding the company's long-term vision and strategy.
- **Autonomy for AMUs**: AMUs are empowered to operate independently once they receive the strategic objectives. The **briefing system** ensures that the right context is provided without hampering the **autonomous, agile nature** of the AMUs.

### **Conclusion: A Layered Approach to Briefing**

In this system:

- The **Leadership Council** focuses on providing **high-level strategic direction** to LFOs.
- The **LFOs** serve as the key communicators, briefing **AMU Leaders** on the specifics of the missions and ensuring they understand how their work fits into the broader strategy.
- **AMU Leaders** take responsibility for briefing their own teams, ensuring that the mission’s objectives are clear and that all team members are aligned with the company’s vision.

This multi-layered approach minimizes the workload on the Leadership Council, while ensuring that all teams are **well-informed** and **aligned** with the company's overall goals.
