Great question. Since you're starting with just yourself, the **Leadership Council** won’t exist as a formal entity immediately. You are, at the outset, both the **sole strategist and executor**. However, the Leadership Council functions as the **strategic core** of the company, and you can lay its **foundations early on** by defining the **vision, strategic direction, and core values**.

Here’s a clarified roadmap for when and how the **Leadership Council** emerges:

### **Phase 1: You as the Initial Leadership Council**

- **In the beginning (just you):** You embody the **entire Leadership Council**. You are responsible for:
  - Defining the **company’s vision, mission, and values.**
  - Setting the **initial strategic goals**.
  - Making high-level decisions about product direction, market entry, and early partnerships.

  At this stage, you’re effectively wearing multiple hats: you're both the **strategist** (Leadership Council) and the **executor** (initial AMU).

#### Key Actions

1. **Document your strategic goals and vision** clearly as if you were the Leadership Council.
2. **Create a feedback loop with yourself** through documentation and iterative thinking. This will be helpful when more team members eventually join.

---

### **Phase 2: Initial Team Formation – Leadership Council’s Prototype**

- Once you’ve validated your business concept and recruited a few initial team members (your first small AMU), the **Leadership Council begins to take shape**.
  - **You remain the key strategic decision-maker**, but you may start involving early hires in high-level discussions and feedback.
  - At this point, the **Leadership Council’s role** is still informal but emerging. You’ll still be the one defining the key strategic directions, but you may start considering how future hires will help co-lead the company’s strategic decisions.

#### Key Actions

1. Begin **identifying key people** from your early team who can grow into future **Leadership Council members** (e.g., someone who shows vision for tech strategy could become a future CTO).

---

### **Phase 3: Multiple AMUs and Leadership Council Formation**

- When you have **several AMUs** executing different missions, **formalize the Leadership Council**. By now, you’re growing the company to a point where high-level **strategic oversight** and **coordination** are crucial for scaling.

  The **Leadership Council** should now include people with distinct domain expertise. You can recruit these leaders internally from the first AMUs or bring in experienced external hires to take on **specific strategic roles** like:

  - **Chief Vision Officer (CVO)** – responsible for ensuring the company’s overall direction aligns with the vision.
  - **Chief Strategy Officer (CSO)** – focused on competitive strategy, market positioning, and growth.
  - **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** – overseeing innovation and technical strategy.

  At this stage, you begin to **delegate high-level strategic decisions** to the council rather than keeping all decisions centralized with yourself.

#### Key Actions

1. **Recruit and appoint leaders** to formally establish the council.
2. **Define strategic roles** within the council to ensure each leader is responsible for a specific aspect of the company’s overall strategy.

### **Summary Of Leadership Council Initiation**

- **You begin as the sole leader**, acting as the Leadership Council yourself.
- Once you have a **small team**, you remain the central strategist but start laying the groundwork for future Leadership Council members.
- When you scale to **multiple AMUs**, you **formalize the Leadership Council** by bringing in leaders responsible for distinct strategic domains.

In short, the Leadership Council begins as you in the early days but evolves and formalizes as the company grows, particularly once multiple AMUs are operating simultaneously and you need a strategic oversight layer to maintain coherence and alignment.
