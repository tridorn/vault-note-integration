# Spot FX

--- 

## Definition

The Spot FX market is an over-the-counter (OTC) market, transactions are not done via an exchange but directly between different parties. 

---

## Description

It operates 24 hours a day.

The Spot FX market is primarily used by big institutions, even more specific by dealers (mostly banks, why it is know as interbank market) who trade between themselves. It is also only accessible to institutions who trade in large quantities and have a high net worth.

In the spot market you trade contracts (not the underlying asset), to buy a specific currency at a specific price. The delivery of this currency is (as opposed to what the name spot may imply) not "on the spot" but rather a few business days later (regularly 2 days after, or T+2).
