## Definition

The Margin Call Level[^1] is the specific level (%) where if your margin level is equal or below it, you won’t be able to open any new positions. Your trading platform determines the Margin Call Level.

For example, if the Margin Call Level is 100%, this means that if your Margin Level reaches 100%, you won’t be opening any new positions. At this point, your account is now under a Margin Call.

Even though most new traders assume this means that their trade(s) may be closed, that’s not true. A Margin Call Level is just a WARNING.[^2]

## General

### Also called

- Minimum Margin Requirement
- Minimum Required Margin

### How to calculate
