# Plan Categorisation

---

## Introduction

*Provide a brief description of the plan's purpose and how it aligns with your broader life management or organizational goals.*

The categorisation system is the first of the pillars in [[2023-12-30-17-57-04|Life Management Framework]]. It serves the purpose to have clear and logical locations for every file with a special focus on actionability of files, generally platform-independent.

The ground structure of the categorisation system is a mix of [[PARA System|PARA]] and [[Getting Things Done|GTD]]. The general structure is designed to not be dependent on the structure of one system and at the same time to be applied in a synchronised way on every system in use. As there is no technical (automatic) synchronisation, it is required to keep the components at the same stage manually.
