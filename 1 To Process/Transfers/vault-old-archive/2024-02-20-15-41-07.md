# Inbox (Plan Tasks)

--- 

## Introduction

An inbox can essentially be anything that is able to capture [[Stuff]] (see [[Getting Things Done|GTD]]). It is important to put everything that you want to act upon or might be unsure about. Every open loop has to be tossed into the inbox to await processing. At opportune times, in the context of the [[2023-12-30-17-57-04]] at predefined times, that is in accordance with [[Time Plan System]] every half an hour session, this inbox is then processed. Every item in the inbox (no matter what form the inbox might have) is looked at and then categorised based on predefined steps.
