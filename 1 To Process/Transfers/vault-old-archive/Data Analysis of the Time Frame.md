# Data Analysis of the Time Frame

--- 

## Exposition

Data analysis of the time frame is part of the [[Time Frame Documents]] and analyses the data of the given time frame. Data is mainly captured in the format of the [[Day Time Frame]], data would thus have to be put together to be analysed. The purpose of this concept is to take a look at the data and comment on changing trends, notable patterns or literally anything else of some importance.

## Structure

Just like [[Events of the Time Frame]] does this concept follow a lose approach to its formulation. There is no strict ruleset, guiding principle should always be usefulness as later reference tool and here specifically clearness of learned principles.

## Related Concepts

> [!note]  
> While this concept could be categorised under [[Data System]], I personally feel it is more fitting to be attributed to the [[Time Plan System]] or [[Time Frame Documents]] specifically. It is more of a casual, prose analysis, similar in spirit to [[Events of the Time Frame]], and the [[Data System]] mainly tracks, stores, and *provides* data.
