# Taking Notes of Books in Note-Taking System

## Introduction

Taking notes of books comes with the unique proposition or question to not only create summaries of the key concepts but also the book itself. The main body are the concepts of the book, taking notes on the book itself is more of a meta level but can prove useful for future references and especially to further the web that is the note system.

## Background

My question from the start was how much I should spend - in terms of time and resources - on taking notes of the book, how much metadata I should include, wether I should go chapter by chapter or only create one summary for everything etcetera. The current approach follows the general note taking structure and could be considered quite the central component or most applicable in the day to day note taking workflow. The process follows a chapter by chapter (book by book) approach, where you first skim the book, jot down central concepts (all in drafts at at the start) that already come to you attention and then start reading the book chapter by chapter (and marking and noting down things that come to mind). First summarizing the content of the chapter in a chapter note, then turning attention the concepts. You first simply write anything down that comes to your mind without worrying about structure, after the chapter finishes you start on forming the lose text into the flower structure, formalizing it bit by bit. After you did this you can should transfer the note into Obsidian for the finishing touches in the form of adding metadata, links and general markdown polish. When you should transfer the notes to Obsidian is a bit up to the context. Itmay be best to transfer notes to Obsidian with multiple chapters batched together, while the further refinement of the lose text should be done chapter by chapter.

## Process

1. **Pre-reading**: First, skim through the book's table of contents, introductions, summaries, and chapter headings. This gives you a general sense of the book's structure and the topics it covers.
2. **Identify key concepts and topics**: While you're skimming, note down the key concepts and topics that you come across. These will form the basis for your concept notes.
3. **Chapter-level note taking**:

	 - **During reading**: While reading a chapter, jot down your thoughts, important points, quotations, and summaries in Drafts. These should be concise and aim to capture the essence of the chapter.
	 - **After reading**: Once you finish a chapter, review your notes and structure them into a coherent summary of the chapter. This could be organized following the structure I provided earlier (Introduction, Definition, Concept, etc.). Also, jot down any questions or thoughts that come up for you about the material.
	 - **Chapter Note in Obsidian**: Once you have a well-structured draft, transfer these notes into Obsidian as a new note for that specific chapter. Add the appropriate metadata (including relation data). At this stage, you could also link to any related notes in your Zettelkasten.

4. **Concept-level note taking**:

	 - **During reading**: While reading, if you come across explanations or discussions of the key concepts you identified earlier, jot down notes about them in Drafts. These could include definitions, examples, implications, etc.
	 - **After reading**: After reading a chapter (or a few chapters), review your concept notes and refine them. Make sure each concept note is focused on one concept and follows the note structure.
	 - **Concept Note in Obsidian**: Transfer these concept notes into Obsidian as standalone notes. Add the appropriate metadata and make links to other relevant notes in your Zettelkasten, including the chapter note where you encountered the concept.

5. **Book-level note**: After finishing the book, you might find it helpful to create a final note that provides an overview of the book, summarizing its key arguments, findings, and insights. This note could link to all your chapter notes and key concept notes.
6. **Review and revise**: Finally, make sure to periodically review and update your notes. This can help consolidate your understanding and make your Zettelkasten a living, evolving knowledge system.
