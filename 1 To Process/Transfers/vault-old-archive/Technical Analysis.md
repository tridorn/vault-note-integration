## Definition

Technical Analysis is the theory that analyzing historical price movements can lead to clues about current trading conditions and future potential price movement.[^1]

## General

Theoretically, all market information should be reflected in the current price. If price reflects all the information out there, then price action is all one would need to make a trade.  
[[Technical Analyst]]s look for similar patterns that have formed in the past and form trade ideas believing that price could possibly act the same way it did before. The easiest way to visualize historical price action is to use charts, using Technical Analysis essentially means analyzing charts. The more [[Technical Trader]]s look out for historical patterns, the more does Technical Analysis become self-fulfilling. It also is highly subjective, one trader may look at the same chart and see something entirely different than another one.[^1]
