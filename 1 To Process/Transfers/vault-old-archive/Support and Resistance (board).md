[[Support]] and [[Resistance]] are no absolute levels, they heavily depend on interpretation of the [[Technical Analyst]]. They can even look different depending on the time frame. They should be **viewed more as zones** rather than exact numbers. One way to filter out noise is to use [[Line Chart]] rather than [[Candlestick Chart]] (because Line Charts only show the closing price, "irrational" movement of the market should be reduced).

- A broken-through resistance or support can in turn change into a support or resistance. A main reason for that is that liquidiation or selling of positions may occur when breaking either resistance or support. 
- The more often a resistance or support is tested, the stronger it is
- How strong a follow up to a broken resistance or support is depends on how strong it has held before
