## Definition

Balance[^1] is the total amount of cash you have in your trading account. If you have an open position, even if it has a floating profit (or loss), your Balance is still the same as before you opened the position. But once you close the position, the profit (or loss) will be added (or deducted) from the Balance and this will be your new Balance.

## General

Changed by e.g.

- Depositing money to your account
- Withdrawing money from your account
- Rollover/swap fees (either paid or deducted)

### Also called

- Account Balance
- Cash
