# Title in Note-Taking System

## Capture the Essence

Regardless of the content's nature, aim to capture its core essence in the title. This can be a defining keyword, emotion, event, or any central theme.

## Embrace Natural Language

For personal reflections, thoughts, or abstract ideas, it might be more useful to phrase titles as questions, statements, or even brief exclamations. 

- *e.g.,* "Why Rain Makes Me Reflect?" or "The Joy of Freshly Brewed Coffee"

## Descriptive Phrases for Fleeting Thoughts

For those one-liner thoughts, use them as the title, or a slightly refined version of them. This ensures that the note's primary idea is immediately visible.

- *e.g.,* "The paradox of choice in modern dating" 

## Use Temporal or Contextual References

If the note is reflective or situational, you might consider referencing the time or context. 

- *e.g.,* "Midnight Thoughts on Friendship" or "Musings during a Mountain Hike"

## Avoid Overthinking

For highly personal or abstract notes, the title doesn't need to fit into a neat box. It's more about capturing the note's spirit or prompting recall.

## Create Broad Categories for Recurring Themes

If you find you often pen down thoughts about certain themes like dreams, daily reflections, or even things like songs that struck a chord, you can start titles with a broad category reference.

- *e.g.,* "Dream: Chasing Shadows" or "Song Reflection: 'Imagine' by John Lennon"

## Combine with the Technical Approach When Needed

For notes that straddle personal reflections and more structured content, combine the above with the technical approach. This hybrid model allows flexibility.

- *e.g.,* "Biology: Personal Reflections on Genetic Determinism"

## Maintain a Titles Log or Index

Considering no two titles will be the same in your system, maintain an index or log of titles. Before finalizing a new one, a quick check ensures no unintentional repetitions.

## Workflow for Broad Topics

### Process

1. **Initial Draft:** Start with what feels natural. It could be a question, a statement, or a keyword.
2. **Revisit After Writing:** Once you pen down the thought or reflection, see if the title still aligns. Adjust if needed.
3. **Check Against Index:** Ensure uniqueness in your system.
4. **Iterative Refinement:** As with more technical notes, it's okay to revisit and refine titles as your perspective evolves or if you feel another title captures the essence better.
