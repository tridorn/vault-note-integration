# Related Concepts is for Hierarchy Only

---

## Exposition

Links in the [[Types in Note-Taking System#Type - Related Concepts|related concepts type]] are always based on [[Breadcrumbs in Note-Taking System]]. The primary use is to visualize hierarchies of directly related concepts (related in term of theme from broader to more specialised). 

Next to the classic components (up, down, same, next, prev) I installed a secondary hierarchy (related - based on same) to link to [[Concepts]] that are not directly inserted into a hierarchical structure, meaning they are neither broader topics to sub-concepts or vice versa, but still relevant (related) to the current concept. I always worried about the appearing "inelegance" of this solution, as there seamed to be a doubling factor with links in the main text and another mention in related concepts after.

The here proposed approach is to leave the type related concepts strictly to the hierarchical structure, every concept that might fall under the forementioned "related" is to be approached in the main text earlier. As Matushak mentions, these "fine-grained" mentions are better than "coarse-grained" (e.g. a "see also" section) ones.
