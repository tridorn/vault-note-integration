# Don't Manage From the Middle Lane, Set Guardrails and Let Lose Otherwise

## Concept

[[Andreas Jendyk]] told me while on a [[Vacation Italy 2023|vacation in Italy]] that his own style of managing and also in general handling people (or educating kids) is to set the boundaries and let them handle things freely besides that.

## Critique

This is exactly my line of thought as well, sparked by [[FÃ¼hren mit Auftrag]]. One of the most important aspects of such leading styles however is, that the people enabled to act on their own violation need to be trained and be able to act in such a manner. This is why in addition to giving the people free reigns, a first introduction and the right tools (or rather right tools and then first introduction, give the people the tools to succeed themselves, take the fear of the unknown by benevolently helping them on their first contact, then let them duke it out on their own, be always there for questions however) must be placed in their hands, only then is an approach of light touch feasible.
