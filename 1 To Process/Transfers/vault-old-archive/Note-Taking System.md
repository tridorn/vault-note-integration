# Note-Taking System

## Foundations

- **Concept:** Every piece of text is anchored in a singular, abstract concept. This concept represents the essence of what you wish to convey, whether it's in a formal note, a text message, an article, or any other piece of intentional writing.
- **Atomicity:** Each note or piece of text must stay true to the principle of atomicity, focusing purely on its core concept without veering into unrelated areas. This guarantees clarity and precision in communication.

## Note Structure

- **Title:** The only Header 1 in a note. It acts as a concise descriptor or abstract of the essence of the topic -- encapsulating the core concept.
- **Types (Header 2s):** These are predefined structures or schemes within a note. Every type directly and singularly pertains to the note's title (or the central concept). They are building blocks, aimed at providing a structured format to the note. Examples include:

	 - **Introduction:** A brief overview of the concept.
	 - **Definition:** An explicit detailing of the concept.
	 - **Related Concepts:** Connections to similar concepts.
	 - And other categories like tables, lists, procedures, etc.
- **Sub-Headings as Distinct Concepts:**
	 - **Nature:** Sub-headings, positioned similarly to types (as Header 2), are fundamentally unique in their essence. They introduce a wholly new concept, and in nature, differ in no way from the parent concept. Both the parent note and its sub-heading(s) are built on the foundation of singular, abstract concepts.
	 - **Purpose of Positioning:** The reason a sub-heading (or its own concept) is placed within a parent note is for cohesion, flow, or context. It might serve to complement or provide further depth to the overarching narrative. However, this does not diminish its individuality or the importance of its atomic nature.

## Scalability and Transformability

- **Extreme Range:** Your system is designed to encapsulate concepts as succinct as a brief line of text, scaling up to the magnitude of an extensive scientific treatise. The core lies in the atomicity of the concept, regardless of its length or depth.
- **Flexibility:** This extreme range emphasizes the flexibility and adaptability of the system. Almost everything within the system can be omitted or incorporated, depending on the nature and intent of the text. The only unwavering principle is that the central concept remains atomic, focused, and undiluted.

## Interconnectedness

- **Linking & Hierarchies:** Notes aren't isolated entities. They can reference other concepts, weaving a rich tapestry of interconnected thoughts. Through this, you can nest concepts within concepts, giving rise to parent-child relationships, much like chapters in an infinitely branching book.

## Practical Implementation

- **Flexibility & Granularity:** Though the system has its foundational structure, it's built for adaptability. Depending on the text's nature and objective, one may not need to employ all the types. A text might need just the primary concept, while a more detailed note might harness multiple types or sub-headings.
- **Tools & Editors:** The system is universal but is particularly advantageous when used with tools like Obsidian, which is designed for granular, interconnected note-taking.

## Decision Points

- **Sub-Headings vs. New Notes:** Contingent on the depth and standalone significance of a sub-topic:
	 - **Sub-Headings:** Ideal for smaller points or when aiming for an uninterrupted flow within a note.
	 - **New Notes:** Suited for concepts that deserve their own space, ensuring granularity and facilitating interlinking.

## Naming Conventions

- To ensure clarity and avoid repetition, some elements (like defined types) should not be incorporated into a title.

## Random Thoughts

- “The Concept of Concepts” would be an intriguing title for an introduction to this note-taking system for a wider audience (Two fold interpretation, one that it is the best of all concepts and the second simply an explanation on the topic of concepts). Optional with the addition “or how to prove the existence of god”. The indefinite layering of notes implies that there exists one note at the very top, reigning supreme over all the others.
