# Plan Time Planning

---

## Introduction

*Provide a brief description of the plan’s purpose and how it aligns with your broader life management or organizational goals.*

The time plan system essentially is a goal-setting mechanism. It sets certain things to be achieved in certain time frames. It is tightly integrated with the [[Task System]].

--- 

## Background

The time plan system, or rather, its origins, can be seen as the "original" productivity system. Right from around the start I envisioned a system that builds on hierarchical time frames (called Zeiträume, representing a time span between two Zeitpunkten) and defines Ziele (goals) that only exist in these time frames. Ziele where things to do and goals at the same time and consisted of parameters Zeitpunkt start, Zeitpunkt end, completed (there were many iterations, different parameters for example). In some variations Ziele could only "link up" in same type, a Ziel related to health in a higher Zeitraum could only be addressed by a Ziel health in a lower one. With time, the system changed to where Ziele would exist in only one Zeitraum as before, but the Ziele in the lower Zeiträume, who were created to concretise the upper ones didn't need to be of the same type. A Ziel "Become a lawyer" could spawn Ziele like "Do sports", "Finish course A", "Join student organisation x". These are not directly related but may influence the completion of the higher level Ziel.

## Situation Analysis

### Current Context (as of [2023-02-13])

*Summarize the current situation or status of the topic this plan addresses.* 

The time plan system theoretically exists in a completed and usable state already, I didn't really employ it up until now. I need to make the whole system more seethrough, and especially easier to use and more standardised. I furthermore have to generate some consistency and routine in its application, that means simply using it to get a feel for its intricacies.

### SWOT Analysis

- **Strengths**: 
	- *(List strengths related to the topic.)* 
	- Everything plannable, form very broad and high level to very specific
	- Quite the elegant solution as every time frame is incorporated and interconnected into a greater whole
	- Workflows quite standardised already
	- Good interplay with different systems, such as through the [[2024-02-12-18-13-10|Time Frame Document]], or the connection to the [[Task System]]
- **Weaknesses**: 
	- *(List weaknesses.)* 
	- Parts are time consuming to maintain
	- There exists an overhead in note creation and set up for the time frames
- **Opportunities**: 
	- *(List opportunities for improvement or growth.)* 
	- Make workflows more fluid
	- Standardise note templates for time frames
- **Threats**: 
	- *(List potential challenges or obstacles.)* 
	- Mental block "too time consuming to maintain/even start to use"

### Resources and Constraints

*Detail the available resources and any constraints impacting this plan.*

--- 

## Plan Goals

*List broad goals for the plan, focusing on the long-term development and refinement of this topic.* 

- **Make different levels of time plannable**: It is important to be able to plan the next day, as well as the next year
- **One should always know that the current action is the best one**: Uncertainty about the best path of action can be reduced when everything is accounted for

*Any elaboration or other text expanding on the plan comes here.*

## Structure

*Outline the key components or aspects of this plan.* 

### Component X: [Component Name]

- **Description**: 
	- *(Detail what this component is and its role within the system.)* 
- **Purpose**:
	- *(Explain why this component is crucial for the system.)* 

### Component 1: Time Frames

- **Description**: 
	- Time frames are areas of time between two points of time. 
- **Purpose**: 
	- They set the context (the frame) for what is viewed and operated on.

### Component 2: Time Frame Documents

- **Description**: 
	- Time Frame Documents are the physical place for everything related to the Time Frame it references.
- **Purpose**:
	- Everything that one might need to address or write down can be put in here. Not even restricted to the Plan Time Plan, it serves as the focal point for every piece of documentation or journaling for that time frame (the most relevant being of course the day)

### Component 3: Time Frame Objectives and Key Results

- **Description**: 
	- TFOKR are objectives with corresponding stats for tracking set in Time Frames to be achieved.
- **Purpose**:
	- They are goals, ambitions, and aims forged into trackable objectives. They serve as the main units of direction next to common tasks that represent the implementation of the objectives.

### Component 4: Categorise - Review - Adjust - Plan & Mindfulness

- **Description**: 
	- CRAPM is a process at the end of every time frame that serves administrative purposes such as reviewing how the time frame went, what can be optimised, or changed, as well as planned for future time frames.
- **Purpose**:
	- CRAPM serves the important meta purpose of keeping the map of everything to do up to date, as well as analysing performance, and especially planning the future.

	- [Date/Duration]: *[Action Step 1] - Details of what needs to be done.* 
	- [Date/Duration]: *[Action Step 2] - Further details.*  
	- … *Add more action steps as needed.* 
	
- **Resource Allocation**:  
	- *[Resource 1] - Description of its use.*  
	- *[Resource 2] - Description of its use.*  
	- … *List additional resources as required.* 

- **Timeline and Milestones**:  
	- *[Milestone 1 by Date] - Description of the milestone.*  
	- *[Milestone 2 by Date] - Description of the next milestone.*  
	- … *Include additional milestones as necessary.* 

*(Repeat the above structure for each component or aspect of the system.)*

## Monitoring and Evaluation

*Explain how the plan will be monitored, evaluated, and developed over time.*

### Progress Tracking

- **Method**: *Describe the method(s) you will use to track progress (e.g., digital tools, journaling, spreadsheets).* 
- **Frequency**: Monthly

### Review and Adaptation

- **Next Review Date**:: 2024-03-02
- **Criteria for Review**: 
	- Did I apply the Plan Time Plan?
	- How well or frequent?
	- Did I also implement higher time frames?
