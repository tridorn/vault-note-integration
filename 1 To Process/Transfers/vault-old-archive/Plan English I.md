# Plan English I

---

## Description

English is my second language and through the years and use especially online and at computers I have grown quite good at it. Just as German this is not good in a formalized way where I am aware of the various grammatical rules governing the language, it is more based on instinct, I write and talk what feels right. To extend this knowledge and give it a more formalized appearance I need to learn the concepts, as I do the same with with [[Plan German I|German]] I can use the knowledge I gather there and vice versa.

Even tho I am quite fluent and sufficiently good, I still need to better myself, especially in grammar, vocabulary and speaking. This is why the midday time during lunch is assigned to be an English learning session. The main focus lies on learning new things, repetition of the e.g. vocabulary is through the general [[Learning]] concept.
