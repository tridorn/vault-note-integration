## Definition

A marubozu (meaning "bald" or "shaved head" in Japanese) is a [[Candlestick Patterns (board)|Candlestick Pattern]] that has a large box and no shadows.[^1]

---

## Description

The large box represents the dominance of one side, either buyers or sellers. It shows a significant price movement between opening and closing basically without opposition (signified through the absence of shadows).[^1]

White marubozu:[^1]

- A white marubozu at the end of an uptrend means a continuation is likely
- A white marubozu at the end of a downtrend means a reverseal is likely

Black marubozu:[^1]

- A black marubozu at the end of an uptrend means a reverseal is likely
- A black marubozu at the end of a downtrend means a continuation is likely
