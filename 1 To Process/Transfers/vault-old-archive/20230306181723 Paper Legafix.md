We are at a breaking point. Somewhere where intellect, thinking, the very core of human advantage is under more attack than for example trash retrieval is. LLMs have proven to be capable to artfully imitate the human, not only in tone, but also also in capability of answers given.  
Chatbots are an old technology, familiar at that.  
Search engines are and old technology, familiar at that.  
The legal market is an especially old one.  
Even tho the legal market is as old as it is, hurdles remain, or rather, are at the forefront. Searching for a lawyer, the right lawyer, the right lawyer for you, scheduling an appointment, paying the mental fee, the cost of advice, a significant slope is in front of "everything legal". While the human contact, a person directly working on your specific case is probably the best and most classic plus, why are there not more steps automated, streamlined? Not from the lawyer perspective, but from the customer side. Well, an easy answer can be, because there is no legal base for it, legal advice can only be delivered by qualified individuals. Furthermore, from a purely technical perspective is it hard to create anything of such a precision and fine-tunement to capture legal processes en pair to a normal lawyer.  
Yet, we think that law should be accessible for everyone, even more, we think it should be easily accessible for everyone. Law firms face no competition and no competition inherently means less innovation. Booking your hourly pay, delivering your service, we think we can do better.  
Our aim is to lower the hurdles we addressed:  
We want to be accessible, online 24/7 and easily locatable, we will not only provide service for specific fields or locations, but for as wide of an array as possible.  
We want to be affordable, rather than relying on strict hourly payments, alternative cost structure for the benefit of everyone can be drawn.  
Our aim is not necessarily to be a replacement for lawyers, we want to integrate with them! Our position can be understood as a "man-in-the-middle", on one hand we provide customers with legal services that are differently structured than the classic way of law is, on the other hand do we want to give lawyers the possibility to market themselves, solve matters more easily, in general, be more productive and capture more markets.  
To jump into the details now:  
Our product is the new Google in the cape of Chat-GPT and the colors of [insert some marketplace for companies here].  
We push the ratio of human-to-robot into the direction of the future, of automation.  
People may google for legal questions they have, they may find answers, written on a 3rd party site by some other person and not necessarily directly linked to their case.  
We have a capable model, trained on huge data sets, equipped with the newest legislature and decision, giving very catered (zugeschnitten) answers to the very specific case the user faces. This model, of course, is only a better search engine, it does not provide true legal advice, it rather provides information, it informs the user. Our model builds on top of that, information is free and available to everyone, what not available to everyone is certainty. When customers go to lawyers they also do not buy information. They buy certainty. They could inform themselves in the internet, read lecture themselves, study law, but they decide to go to a lawyer. They do this to be informed, but even more to get certainty, they connect the result (they could get themselves if they would inform themselves) to the name of the lawyers.
