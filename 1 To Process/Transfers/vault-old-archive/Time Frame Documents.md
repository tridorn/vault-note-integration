# Time Frame Documents

--- 

## Introduction

The time frame document holds everything related to a [[Time Frames|Time Frame]], most commonly its [[Time Frame Objectives and Key Results|TFOKR]], any reference or guidance needed for during the time frame ([[Ongoing Time Frame Document]]) and serves as a later reference tool for that time frame ([[Completed Time Frame Document]]).

--- 

## Exposition

The time frame document does not need to log things like "problems encountered", "productivity", or other such data driven information (this approach is pursued by [[Data System]]). It is to stress that the completed time frame document is a [[Time Frame Documents Are the Container for Every Reference Tool in That Time Frame|reference tool]], if anything particulary noteworthy happened, it is to preserve. 

*The document should be designed in a way that requires the least effort while adhering to its goal of being a useful reference tool*.

## Structure

The time frame document - as opposed to what the name suggests - is not necessarily or always one coherent and formalised document and can be anything from a collection of notes (only in the [[Ongoing Time Frame Document]] phase) to one, fully formatted document.
