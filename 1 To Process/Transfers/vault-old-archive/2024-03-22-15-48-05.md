--- 

## Definition

This note serves as a central point and overview of the philosophic aspect of [[2024-03-19-21-33-38|Artificial Intelligence]] and how humans will grapple with the emergence of a competing intelligence that possibly eclipses their own.  
It is distinct from the [[2024-03-12-16-39-50|main category on philosophy]] as it isn't really a whole established field in itself, but closely linked to its parent topic.
