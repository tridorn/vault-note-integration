# Metadata in Note-Taking System

## Introduction

Metadata does not only refer to YAML metadata, but rather systems that are not content of the file itself and rather ways to describe its content in different ways or to systematically organize aspects of it.

## Frontmatter

YAML metadata. Sektion 0 in the context of Flower. 

### ID

An UUID to make the current note distinguashable.

### Author

The author(-s) of the current file.

### Created

The [[Date Time in Categorisation System]] the current [[File]] was created.

### Last_modified

The date time the current file was last modified.

### Aliases

The aliases of the current file.

### Tags

The tags of the current file. Primarily [[Topic Tags in Categorisation System]]

## Inline

Metadata that is not in the frontmatter but inline in plain text to foster readability.

### Tags

In guidance of [[Tags in Note-Taking System]] there are a few [[Administrative Tags in Categorisation System]] that are inline. TODOs are thus not placed in the frontmatter to indicate a todo for the file, but rather at the location something needs to be changed. This further serves the purpose to distinguish them from topic tags.

### Breadcrumbs

Technically also Metadata, the referencing to other concepts also has a hierarchical perspective thanks to [[Breadcrumbs in Note-Taking System]].
