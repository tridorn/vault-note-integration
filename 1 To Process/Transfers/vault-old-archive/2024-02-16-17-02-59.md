# Events of the Time Frame

--- 

## Introduction

The content of the time frame is a summary of what happened during its [[Time Frames|Time Frame]]. It is a fundamental part of the [[Time Frame Documents]].

--- 

## Structure

There currently is no predefined structure one should strictly adhere. A style has to develop through time and usage. Generally speaking and in the spirit of the [[Time Frame Documents]], the content should be formatted in a way that eases its later use as a reference tool.

One could for example use sub headers for the different sub time frames, one could not reference any time frames at all and tell a story in prose etcetera.
