# Don't Just Copy Text',' Use Your Own Words to Formulate the Concept

--- 

## Elaboration

The purpose of note-taking is to get in your brain or for later reference and not to have the most on paper. Writing helps the creative process and using your own words to decribe something means you have to interact with the material and possibly even understand it (to describe its meaning).  
This is why it is better to read and formulate in your own words thereafter than copying large swathes of text. **Even if that means your notes are inferior to when you would have copy pasted everything.**
