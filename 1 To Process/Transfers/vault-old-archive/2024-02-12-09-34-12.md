# Plan Personal Religion

---

## Introduction

*Provide a brief description of the plan’s purpose and how it aligns with your broader life management or organizational goals.*

The plan personal religion aims at naming morals, virtues, and in general how to act and elevates them by giving them a spiritual layer, going beyond the earthly regions of pursuit.  
[[Path of Imperius]] is the main document for the personal religion and designed like a constitution, to provide more formality.  
The personal religion is designed to incorporate my fundamental base of being, which morals strive to follow, etc., all in the coat of a more institutionalised and formal manner.

## Situation Analysis

### Current Context (as of [2024-02-12])

*Summarize the current situation or status of the topic this plan addresses.*

	- Place to write morals down
	- Might be easier to adapt because of religious component
- **Weaknesses**:

### Resources and Constraints

*Detail the available resources and any constraints impacting this plan.*

I have the Obsidian rock and the rock crystal, two designated symbols. As this is fundamental plan, I will put much effort into it.

Don't exactly know which constraints would impact the plan, but I imagine things like not enough time or motivation.
