# Architecture and Design

--- 

## Definition

Architecture and Design is a category in [[2024-03-20-04-24-55|Arts & Culture]] and in turn [[2024-03-10-16-58-22|Resources]].  
It contains all of my notes from architectural history, over urban planning, over interior (in a general context, not to be confused with interior design in home and lifestyle #a/aL ), to garden design (see garden in home and lifestyle #a/aL ).
