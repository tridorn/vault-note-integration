# Forex Brokers

---

## Description

There is no such thing as a retail forex "broker".[^1] 

You are not trading the underlying currency but make bets with a counterparty (the "broker") about which direction the price is going to move. It is important to make sure that your broker is able to pay out if you made a winning trade. You also have to make sure the quoted prices are fair and [[Slippage]] is as low as possible.[^2]

Historically, the [[Forex]] industry has suffered from a lack of regulation and oversight. It is important to verify the integrity of the company you chose, as you will be sending them money to be able to open trades.[^3]  
Questions that are relevant:

- Is it a real company?
- Where is it located?
- Who runs the company?
- Can you contact the company?
- Is your money handled safely?
