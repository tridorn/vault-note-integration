## Introduction

Tasks in the context of [[2024-02-20-15-15-10|Plan Tasks]] refer to [[2024-02-20-15-43-49|Actions]] (chosen from [[Next Actions in Task System]]) that are planned purposefully. That means here that they were chosen factoring in various variables in [[2024-02-13-18-24-13|CRAPM]] to be worked on in a specific half an hour time frame. Tasks are thus the same as the actions they are based on (in fact, nothing is changed on their "conversion" to tasks), the only thing changing is that they are planned for a specific half an hour time frame.
