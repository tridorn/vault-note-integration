## Definition 

Orders that are different to a [[Market Order]] or [[Pending Order]].

## General

### Good Till Cancelled (GTC)

A GTC order remains active in the market until you decide to cancel it.

### Good for the Day (GFD)

A GFD order remains active in the market until the end of the trading day. 

### One-Cancels-the-Other (OCO)

An OCO order is a combination of two entry and/or stop loss orders. Two orders are placed above and below the current price. When one of the orders is executed the other order is canceled.

### One-Triggers-the-Other (OTO)

An OTO only puts on orders when the parent order is triggered.
