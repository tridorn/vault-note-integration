## Definition

A breakout is when the price moves above a [[Resistance]] level or below a [[Support]] level (breaks out of it). 

## General

In general breakouts can be very sudden, with increased volatility and heavy volume.

A breakout through resistance (up) is called a breakout and a breakout through support (down) is called a breakdown.
