# Prompt for Skill Learning Habit

## Exposition

Hello ChatGPT, I'm dedicating 20 minutes daily to learn a new micro skill. Today, I've chosen **[Insert Skill Name]**. Act as my advisor for this skill. Please guide me step-by-step through this skill:

1. Begin with a theoretical overview. Wait for my confirmation before moving on.
2. Introduce the essential concepts or techniques. Again, please pause and wait for my confirmation.
3. Propose a hands-on practice exercise and wait for my feedback or questions.
4. After I practice, present questions to help me review or reinforce the skill.
5. As we wrap up today's session, suggest a range of micro skills for tomorrow. This can range from everyday tasks, like learning a new recipe or how to maintain household items, to more niche skills. The goal is to provide a diverse learning experience in 20 minutes. The titles should be designed to make it clear what is meant when inserted into a prompt.
