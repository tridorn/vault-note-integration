# How to Plan a TFOKR

## Exposition

Setting a session objective involves understanding what you need to achieve in a specific time frame and aligning it with your broader goals and current circumstances. In terms of deriving "inspiration" for your session objectives, there are several places you can look:

1. **Higher-Level Objectives:** These include your daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly objectives. They guide your long-term goals and aspirations, and your half-hour session objectives should ideally be contributing towards achieving these higher-level objectives.

2. **APAS System (Projects and Areas):** This system holds all your concrete tasks (next actions) and also your ongoing commitments and larger goals (projects). If you have a project deadline coming up, for example, it would make sense for your session objectives to be related to that project.

3. **Context:** Your current situation, the tools you have available, and the people around you could also influence your session objective. If you're in a noisy environment, for example, choosing tasks that require deep concentration might not be ideal.

4. **Time available:** Some tasks may take longer than others. When you plan your session objective, consider the time you have available and match it to the tasks that fit into this time slot.

5. **Energy Levels:** Different tasks require different levels of energy. You might schedule tasks that require more focus and energy when your energy levels are typically high, and less demanding tasks when your energy levels are lower.

6. **Priority:** Some tasks are more urgent or important than others. Prioritize these tasks when setting your session objective.

7. **Data Gathered:** The data you gather from each session can provide valuable insights into your working habits, strengths, and weaknesses. You could use this information to adjust your session objectives and make your work sessions more productive.

Remember that you're not expected to create new projects or next actions every time you set a session objective. The idea is to choose objectives that align with your current projects and next actions. These objectives should not only align with your broader goals, but also consider your current context, time availability, energy levels, and priorities. As you practice this planning process, you'll become more adept at setting session objectives quickly and effectively.
