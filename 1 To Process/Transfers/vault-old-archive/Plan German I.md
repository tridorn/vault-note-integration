# Plan German I

---

## Description

As my native tongue and while I am in Germany and surrounded by German I do not see the necessity to maintain a constant training regime. This means that I will not be assigning daily times to learning German but not that I will not advance my knowledge at all. Every now and then I should assign focus times to further my knowledge of the German language, especially grammar. This can be done on my own accord and does not need a further and more detailed planning beforehand.
