# Interaction with chat bot 20230206175349

1. Focus on specific scenarios: Provide the user with specific legal scenarios or problems and ask them to interact with the chatbot to find a solution. This will help keep the conversation focused on legal topics and give you valuable data on how the chatbot is functioning.
2. Ask open-ended questions: Encourage the user to ask open-ended questions and explore different solutions to their legal problems. This will give you a good understanding of the user's thought process and what they are looking for in a legal solution.
3. Limit choices: Limit the choices that the user has to interact with the chatbot. For example, you could provide a list of common legal questions and ask the user to choose one to ask the chatbot. This will help steer the conversation in a specific direction and provide you with more structured data.
4. Offer prompts: Provide prompts to the user to help keep the conversation flowing and prevent decision paralysis. For example, you could ask the user to ask the chatbot about a specific aspect of the law or to follow up on a previous question.
5. Provide feedback: Offer the user feedback on their interactions with the chatbot, both positive and negative. This will help them understand what is working well and what needs improvement, and also provide you with valuable insights into the user experience.

# Input prompts

Start:  
As part of a user test, we would like you to focus on legal matters and guide the user through common legal scenarios. The goal of this test is to gather insights into how users interact with your legal advice capabilities, and to identify areas for improvement.

Please keep the conversation focused on legal topics, and try to assist the user in finding the information they are seeking. If the user asks a question that is not related to legal matters, gently steer them back towards the legal topic at hand.
