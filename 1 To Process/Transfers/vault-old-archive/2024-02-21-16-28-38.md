# Components Do Not Have to Be Part of Only One Plan

--- 

## Exposition

Plans are only texts addressing a certain aspect after all, they aren't strictly systems any more. Things like projects thus can be part of both plan categorisation and plan tasks. Even beyond that, the files of the plans do not have to stay (consider if *should* not) stay in the LMF folders, instead be distributed throughout Falen.
