# NFTs aus rechtlicher Sicht (transcript)

## Summary

## Key concepts

- NFTs based on blockchain
- Blockchain based on blocks, one linked to the another one
- Race against each other to close one block
- Proof of work (calculation of a mathematical problem), proof of stake (verification based on how much one holds)
- NFT = Non-Fungible Token
- Cryptographic unique Token that represent a certain other thing
- Web 3

By buying a NFT you do not buy the Urheberrecht, but the Nutzungsrecht of the asset.
