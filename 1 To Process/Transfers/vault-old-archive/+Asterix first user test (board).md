# +Asterix first user test (board)

Everything related to the first user test on 2023-02-06 at the event of "Karriereweg Legal Tech" at Lutz|Abel with Viran.

## Problems

- How do we limit the chatbot to legal related questions? If our base product is free, what would stop the user from just using it as a platform to ask any questions on our cost?
