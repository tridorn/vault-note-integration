## Major banks

Since the market is decentralized, the biggest banks determine the exchange rates. Also known as the *interbank market*.

## Large Commercial Companies

Companies must first change their local currencies to the foreign one if doing international business. They typically deal with commercial banks for their transactions. International M&As can also create currency exchange rate fluctuations.

## Governments and Central Banks

Governments are also involved in the Forex market on a regular basis in a variety of tasks. Such as international trade payments and handling their foreign exchange reserves.

Central banks may influence the forex market through interest rates or by directly intervening.

## Speculators

Speculators make up about 90% of the Forex market. They do not trade to simply exchange one currency to the other but rather speculate on prices changes in order to make money.
