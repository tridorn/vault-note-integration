## Definition

A spinning top is a [[Candlestick Patterns (board)|Candlestick Pattern]] that has a small box and a long upper and lower shadow.[^1]

## General

The color of the box is not relevant, what matters is the small box indicating little price movement between opening and closing and the long shadows on *both* ends symbolizing great price movement during the time (but before close). It essentially colors a battle between buyers and sellers with no side emerging victorious.[^1]

In a downtrend a spinning top can mean that there are not many sellers left and a reversal could happen and vice versa (in an uptrend with buyers).[^1]
