# Current List for Tasks

Using a separate "Current" list with tasks tagged as "In-Progress" is an excellent strategy for managing your tasks dynamically throughout the day. Deciding when to remove incomplete tasks from the "Current" list depends on your workflow and personal preferences. Here are two approaches you could consider:

### Approach 1: End of Each Timeframe

#### Pros

- **Immediate Clarity**: Ensures that your "Current" list reflects only the tasks you are actively working on during the present half-hour.
- **Better Focus**: Helps maintain a sharp focus on the current timeframe's objective without the distraction of incomplete tasks from previous slots.
- **Real-Time Adjustment**: Allows for real-time reassessment and reprioritization of tasks, keeping your task list highly relevant.

#### Cons

- **Frequent Updates**: Requires more frequent updating of your task list, which can be time-consuming.

### Workflow

1. **Start of Timeframe**: At the beginning of each half-hour slot, review and add tasks to the "Current" list.
2. **End of Timeframe**: Remove or update the status of tasks in the "Current" list:
	- **Completed**: Mark as done and remove from the "Current" list.
	- **Incomplete**: Move back to their original lists or re-prioritize based on the Eisenhower Matrix.

### Approach 2: End of Day Cleansing

#### Pros

- **Less Frequent Updates**: Reduces the need for constant updating, saving time.
- **Daily Reflection**: Provides a structured time at the end of the day to reflect on what was accomplished and what needs to be carried forward.
- **Flexibility**: Allows you to keep working on a task if it extends slightly beyond the planned timeframe without immediate need to re-categorize it.

#### Cons

- **Potential Clutter**: The "Current" list might become cluttered with incomplete tasks, which can reduce focus and clarity.

### Workflow

1. **Start of Timeframe**: Add tasks scheduled for the next half-hour to the "Current" list.
2. **Throughout the Day**: Work on tasks as planned without removing incomplete tasks immediately at the end of each timeframe.
3. **End of Day**: Review the "Current" list:
	- **Completed**: Mark as done and remove from the "Current" list.
	- **Incomplete**: Reassign to the appropriate smart lists (e.g., "Important and Urgent", "Important but Not Urgent") for future scheduling.

### Best Practice Recommendation

Consider a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of both methods:

1. **During the Day**: 
	- At the start of each timeframe, review and update the "Current" list with tasks planned for that half-hour.
	- At the end of each timeframe, quickly review the status of tasks:
	  - If a task is nearly complete, consider extending focus to finish it if your schedule allows.
	  - If not, decide whether to keep it in the "Current" list or move it back to its original list.

2. **End of Day Cleansing**: 
	- Conduct a thorough review at the end of the day to ensure all tasks in the "Current" list are appropriately updated.
	- Reflect on your progress, adjust priorities, and prepare for the next day by moving incomplete tasks back to their respective lists or rescheduling them.

By integrating these approaches, you maintain flexibility and ensure that your "Current" list remains relevant and manageable throughout the day, while also having a dedicated time for a more detailed review and adjustment.
