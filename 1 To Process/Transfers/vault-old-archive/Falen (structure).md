# Falen (structure)

This structure is designed to be universally applicable (and to be universally applied) in every system that is used. It is not necessary to have the whole structure in every system, Ziel is designed with modularity in mind, the main focus is actionability.

## 0 Administration

Is made up of folders that are meta to the current system

### Structure

- Inbox
- Templates
- Script
- Attachments
- Documentation of Ziel

## 1 Actionable

A system of folder where projects are categorized under the presumption of actionability. 

A project 
- has a dedicated folder 
- has a board (type) file (links to all the files used and created through)
- has a Reference folder
and represents a task to be done, something to be worked on.  

#todo integrate the actionability component (under what folder projects get categorized, when this categorization changes) in the overarching plan, possibly Struktur 

#todo define exact parameters to when projects fall under each category (e.g. what it means that a project "is currently being worked on").

### Structure

- Current
- Upcoming
- Someday maybe
- Delegated
- Waiting for

### Current

Projects that are currently being worked on.

### Upcoming

Projects that scheduled to be worked on in the near future.

### Someday maybe

Projects where the factor of time is unclear.

### Delegated

Projects that are being worked on by other people.

### Waiting for

Projects that need components other people are responsible for.


## 2 Collection

### Structure

- Fields
- Reference
- Books
- Transcripts

###  Fields

Objective knowledge organized after the [[Universal Decimal Classification]]. No media or any type of note other than wiki-like entries are stored in here. These notes are in a mature stage of development.

[[Fields (structure)#Structure]]

### Reference

Reference is reference material of projects hat still may be relevant to other projects.

### Books

Books are put into


## 3 Archive

### Structure

- [YEAR]
	- [MONTH]
		- [KEYWORD]
- ...


The archive has a date based structure. Things that land in the archive are expected to not be used frequently or at all, the categorization structure is thus not designed around accessibility and ease of retrieval but long term storage. To make finding things again somewhat easier, files are not just "thrown into" the month category but put under keywords folders to group them.
