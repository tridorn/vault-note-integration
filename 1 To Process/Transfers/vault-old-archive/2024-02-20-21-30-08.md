# Waiting For (Plan Tasks)

--- 

## Introduction

Waiting for in task system is a list for reminders of delegated actions to other people.

When a task was handed over to a third party an item is added to waiting for to remind of the delegated task. It is best to also include the date the task was handed over to have at hand when getting back to the person.
