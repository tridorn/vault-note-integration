# Forex Rollover

## Description

You have to pay interest on all open positions after your providers "cut-off time", called "rollover fee" or "swap fee".

Interest is paid on the currency that is borrowed (quote currency if I understood correctly) and earned on the one that is bought (base currency if I understood correctly). If the interest rate of the currency you are buying is higher than the one you are borrowing you will earn money.
