# Versioned Vs. Obsolete Stage

The choice between using **lifecycle-versioned** and **lifecycle-obsolete** depends on the context and intent behind keeping or referencing a particular piece of content. Here's a detailed explanation of when to use each tag:

### **lifecycle-versioned**

Use this tag when:

1. **Multiple Versions are Active**: There are several versions of a note or document that are all still relevant and in use. Each version represents a stage in the evolution of the content, but none are considered outdated or irrelevant.
2. **Version Tracking**: You want to keep track of changes over time, and each version might have specific use cases or contexts where it's applicable.
3. **Reference Purposes**: Previous versions may still hold valuable information or methods that could be referenced or re-used. This is common in software documentation, research papers, or iterative project documentation.
4. **Continuous Updates**: The content is regularly updated, and you maintain old versions for record-keeping, compliance, or historical insight.

**Example**: 
- **A research note**: You may have different versions as your research progresses, with each version reflecting new findings or adjustments based on feedback.

### **lifecycle-obsolete**

Use this tag when:

1. **Content is Outdated**: The note or document is no longer relevant, useful, or accurate. It has been superseded by a newer version or more current information.
2. **Replacement**: There is a clear successor to the content, which means the old version should no longer be used for current purposes.
3. **Archival Only**: The content is kept purely for archival purposes, historical interest, or regulatory reasons, but not intended for active use or reference.

**Example**:
- **An old project plan**: An obsolete tag would be appropriate if the project has significantly changed direction and the old plan is no longer applicable but retained for historical documentation.

### Practical Examples in Note-Taking

#### Scenario 1: Note-Taking Methodology Variants

- **Current Best Practice**: The most up-to-date note-taking method is tagged as **lifecycle-final**.
- **Previous Method**: A previous method that is still relevant in certain contexts is tagged as **lifecycle-versioned**.
- **Outdated Method**: An old method that you no longer recommend or use could be tagged as **lifecycle-obsolete**.

#### Scenario 2: Study Notes

- **Study Notes for Ongoing Courses**: Versions of your notes as you progress through the course might be tagged as **lifecycle-versioned**.
- **Notes from Completed Courses**: Once the course is completed and the notes are no longer updated, but still relevant for future reference, they remain **lifecycle-final** or **lifecycle-versioned**.
- **Outdated Notes**: Notes from a course that is now outdated or has been replaced by more current material can be tagged as **lifecycle-obsolete**.

### Summary

- **lifecycle-versioned**: For content with multiple useful iterations where each version has its own relevance.
- **lifecycle-obsolete**: For content that is outdated and has been replaced, kept only for archival purposes.

By applying these tags appropriately, you maintain a clear and organized system that indicates not just the status but also the relevance and usability of each piece of content.
