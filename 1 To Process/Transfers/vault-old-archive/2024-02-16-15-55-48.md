# CRPAM is for Administrative Work Only

--- 

## Exposition

With the cadence of the half an hour time frames it is important to ensure the system does take as little time as possible from “real working hours”.  
The half an hour RAP is designated to do only work “on” (meta level) things instead of “work” on things.  
The same can be said for every other time frame.
