# Use at Least 3 Well Fit Topic Tags per Note

--- 

## Elaboration

For every new note assign at least 3 [[2024-02-19-17-29-15|Topic Tags]]. Instead of always reusing and recycling tags based on similar notes already created, try to think of unique ones that can be seen as an abstract of the note in at least 3 tags. Remember that they exist to categorise notes and increase findability.
