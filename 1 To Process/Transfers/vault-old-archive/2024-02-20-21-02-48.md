# Directives

--- 

## Definition

Directives are singular enactments that regulate possibly whatever in my personal life.

---

## What it Means in Practice

When I want to change or address anything I simply create a new directive, or in other words, write a simple sentence depicting the change I want, and store it at the appropriate location.

--- 

## Where Directives Are Stored

Directives referring to everyday application are created and stored in Drafts in their own workspace. Those focussed on changes to the note-taking system or things related to Obsidian in general are stored in Obsidian accordingly in a folder located in [[2024-02-19-16-33-27|Administration (Plan Categorisation)]].

## Examples

 - I want to make better use of my walking-time and enact a directive to "Always listen to podcasts during walking".
 - Showering warm has a negative effect on my skin so I "Only shower cold" from now on
