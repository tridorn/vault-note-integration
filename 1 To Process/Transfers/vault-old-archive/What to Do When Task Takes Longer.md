# What to Do When Task Takes Longer

## Exposition

When a task takes longer than expected, there are a few approaches you can consider, each with its own trade-offs. The right one depends on the specifics of your situation, the nature of the tasks, and your personal productivity style.

1. **Continue Until Completion:** If the cleaning task is close to completion, it might make sense to simply continue until it's done, especially if it would be difficult to restart it later. You would then start your eating task later than originally planned. This approach may be less disruptive but can lead to time overruns.

2. **Pause and Return:** If the cleaning task isn't urgent and can easily be resumed later, you might pause it to start your eating task as planned, and then return to the cleaning task afterward. This keeps you on schedule but can incur a "context switching" cost.

3. **Reschedule:** If the cleaning task is taking much longer than anticipated, you might need to reschedule the remaining cleaning to a later time slot in your plan, and start your eating task as scheduled. This can prevent one task from causing a cascading delay, but requires you to have flexibility in your schedule.

4. **Adjust Future Expectations:** If tasks frequently take longer than expected, it might be a sign that you're underestimating how long tasks take. Try to learn from these situations to make your future planning more accurate. 

In all cases, be sure to take note of this overrun in your planning/review sessions. It's important data that can help you understand your work patterns better and improve your time estimates in the future. Don't be hard on yourself if tasks take longer than anticipated - it's an opportunity for learning and adjusting. The goal isn't perfection but improvement and better self-understanding.
