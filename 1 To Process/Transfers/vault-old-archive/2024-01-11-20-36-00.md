# Problems

## List

- Should I use call-out boxes for quotes or use the simpler method
- How should I structure Anki hierarchies
- How should I structure Anki cards
- In related concepts, how to refer to current and related concept
- In related concepts, visually unclear what the descriptions refer to (which referenced concepts the elaborating paragraphs refer to)
- Check where and how to set half an hour objectives. Maybe the current google forms list is not enough any more
- The archived and project tags would be administrative tags, but administrative tags are currently part of the note-taking system and as such centered around Obsidian.
- There currently exists no equivalent to the [[End of the Day]] for higher time frames. But the end of the day process includes some vital steps like the creation and maintaining of the [[Time Frame Documents]].
- When I follow the practice of archiving old versions of notes I somehow have to change all the linkings to the new note. Probably have to do it on archiving and check the backlinks and update all of them to the new note. This just reiterates that the archiving only has to be done on fundamental changes to the content of the note
