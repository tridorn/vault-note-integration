# Footnotes in Note-Taking System

## Exposition

#a/fM

Your own reflections, comments, or additional information. 

- **Inline Notes**: For short notes, you can use parentheses or brackets.
	 - AI is on the rise (see my note on the AI summit last month).

- **Footnotes**: For longer reflections or tangential information. In Obsidian, you can use `[^n]` for inline footnotes and then at the bottom of your note define the footnote with `[^n]: Your footnote content`.
	 - It's been debated whether AI will truly surpass human intelligence.[^2]

	 ```
    [^2]: Many believe that while AI can outperform in specific tasks, general intelligence is a long way off.
    ```

- **Transclusions** (specific to Obsidian): If you have an entire note that can be linked to or is relevant, instead of just referencing it, you can bring its content within another note using `![[NoteName]]`.
