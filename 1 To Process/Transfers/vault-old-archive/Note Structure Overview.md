# Note Structure Overview

1. **Title (Concept)**
	- The essence of the note's content, encapsulating the primary concept.
	- Should be concise, clear, and reflective of the content.

2. **Metadata**
	- Contains information like the author, creation date, last modified date, tags, and links to parent/sub-concepts (if applicable).
	- Helps in organizing, searching, and contextualizing the note within the broader knowledge system.

3. **Main Content (Flexible Type)**
	- The core of the note, which can vary in type depending on the nature and requirements of the concept.
	- Types could include 'Exposition', 'Analysis', 'Reflection', 'Argumentation', etc., chosen based on what best suits the concept's exploration.

4. **Supportive Types**
	- These are additional structured elements that complement the main content. They can include:
	  - **Introduction**: Briefly introduces and sets the context for the main content.
	  - **Definition**: Clarifies terms or concepts crucial for understanding the main content.
	  - **Related Concepts**: Links to other notes or concepts that provide additional insight or contrasting viewpoints.
	  - **Further Exploration**: Any types that encourage deeper understanding or provide supplementary information.
	  - **Conclusion**: Summarizes the main points, encapsulating the takeaways from the note.

5. **Sub-Concepts (Nested Concepts)**
	- Where a new, yet directly relevant concept emerges within the note, it can be identified as a sub-concept.
	- Each sub-concept can theoretically follow the same structure (Title, Metadata, Main Content, etc.), and be linked back to the parent note for cohesive navigation.

## Practical Application

- When creating a note, start by defining the **Title**.
- Add **Metadata** for organizational purposes.
- Identify the type of **Main Content** based on the concept's complexity and nature. This is where the bulk of your information or discussion will reside.
- Use **Supportive Types** to provide context, background, and additional layers of understanding.
- Recognize and delineate **Sub-Concepts** as they arise. Treat them as independent notes nested within the primary note, following the same structural principles.

## Tips for Implementation

- **Flexibility in Main Content**: The type of main content should be fluid, adapting to the needs of each specific note.
- **Consistency**: While the types used can vary, maintaining a consistent approach to how each type is applied across your notes is crucial.
- **Linking for Depth**: Use linking strategically to connect related concepts, especially when dealing with sub-concepts, to create a rich, interconnected knowledge network.

This structured yet flexible approach allows you to accommodate a wide range of note types and lengths, from simple statements to complex, multi-layered discussions, while maintaining clarity and coherence throughout your note-taking system.
