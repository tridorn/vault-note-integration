# Plan Tasks

---
**

## Introduction

*Provide a brief description of the plan's purpose and how it aligns with your broader life management or organizational goals.*

The task system represents the physical landscape of "what is to do". It aims for capturing everything, every "open loop" no matter how small (to a certain degree) and transforming it into actionable items. Here I want to give a general overview of the genesis, the main features and especially components of the whole system.

The main aspects of this system are of theoretical nature. It mainly defines concepts and workflows and creates a general philosophy of how to [[Inbox in Task System|capture stuff]]. How these practices are actually applied, i.e. the physical or digital locations, is described in [[2024-02-19-14-53-26|Plan Categorisation]].

## Background

This system largely builds upon [[Getting Things Done|GTD]]. It can be seen as a direct copy as I understand it with some minor alterations here and there.

## Situation Analysis

### Current Context (as of 2024-02-20)

*Summarize the current situation or status of the topic this plan addresses.* 

The tasks system is more or less formalised, however not applied in practice. It developed from my readings of GTD and interpretations based on the digital tools used. I captured everything (in Apple Reminders, the primary tool) once, but since have been acting besides this structure and over time it has grown out of date. Theoretically, I would check and update my system every half an hour, this is never done however.

### SWOT Analysis

- **Strengths**: 
	- *(List strengths related to the topic.)* 
	- Elegant solution
	- Has full implementation mapped out
	- Easy and quick to use
- **Weaknesses**: 
	- *(List weaknesses.)* 
	- Has to be constantly maintained
	- Workflows appear complicated at first, steep getting-used to curve
- **Opportunities**: 
	- *(List opportunities for improvement or growth.)*
	- Context lists in use
- **Threats**: 
	- *(List potential challenges or obstacles.)* 
	- Time consuming to maintain

### Resources and Constraints

*Detail the available resources and any constraints impacting this plan.*

I use Apple Reminders, a free program as the main tool.

Additionally I use the pro version of Drafts, which requires an annual payment of 20 euros.

## Plan Goals

*List broad goals for the plan, focusing on the long-term development and refinement of this topic.* 

- **Capture every action**: Every mental loop, every lose end has to be tied together and put on paper in this system. 
- **Use this system to plan and work on tasks**: Instead of doing whatever one feels like or working on whatever is in front of one, the actions of this system should be actually applied

*Any elaboration or other text expanding on the plan comes here.*

## Structure

*Outline the key components or aspects of this plan.* 

### Component X: [Component Name]

- **Description**: 
	- *(Detail what this component is and its role within the system.)* 
- **Purpose**:
	- *(Explain why this component is crucial for the system.)* 

### Component 2: [Component Name]

- **Description**: 
	- *(Detail what this component is and how it functions.)* 
- **Purpose**: 
	- *(Purpose of this component.)* 

… *(Add more components as necessary.)*

--- 

## Implementation Strategy

*Describe how you will operationalize or apply this plan in practice.*

### [Component/Aspect]

- **Action Steps**:  
	- [Date/Duration]: *[Action Step 1] - Details of what needs to be done.* 
	- [Date/Duration]: *[Action Step 2] - Further details.*  
	- … *Add more action steps as needed.* 
	
- **Resource Allocation**:  
	- *[Resource 1] - Description of its use.*  
	- *[Resource 2] - Description of its use.*  
	- … *List additional resources as required.* 
- **Timeline and Milestones**:  
	- *[Milestone 1 by Date] - Description of the milestone.*  
	- *[Milestone 2 by Date] - Description of the next milestone.*  
	- … *Include additional milestones as necessary.* 

*(Repeat the above structure for each component or aspect of the system.)*

## Monitoring and Evaluation

*Explain how the plan will be monitored, evaluated, and developed over time.*

### Progress Tracking

- **Method**: *Describe the method(s) you will use to track progress (e.g., digital tools, journaling, spreadsheets).* 
- **Frequency**: Monthly

### Review and Adaptation

- **Next Review Date**:: 2024-03-02 
- **Criteria for Review**: 
	- Did I maintain the system?
	- How often did I check and update the system?
	- Did I develop routine in use?

## Reflections and Adjustments

- **[Date]**: 
	- **Reflections**: *(Summary of insights from recent reviews or experiences.)* 
	- **Adjustments Made**: *(Detail any changes or updates to the system.)*
