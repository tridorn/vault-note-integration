# Formlessness of Atomicity in Note-Taking System

## Description

Atomicity can also be preserved without a title. An enumeration is also sufficient for example. The most important part is once again that the concept is conveyed atomically, the separation can be in any way, it must be clear however that a separation exists. 

A simple separation by paragraph is **not** sufficient as it does not make it clear enough that this new paragraph holds an entirely separate concept. Types (without their descriptive headers) can be simply separated by paragraph inside of a concept. Best practice is to include the headers to make it unambiguously clear what this section is about.
