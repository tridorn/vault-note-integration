# Calendar in Task System

## Exposition

The calendar serves as the tool to schedule things that can only be done on certain days or certain times.

## Comparison

While [[Actions in Task System|actions]] are to be done at the next time available (see also [[Three Models for Decision Making]] for how to decide that), things entered into the calendar can truly only be done where specified.
