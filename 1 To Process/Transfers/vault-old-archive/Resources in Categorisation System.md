# Resources in Categorisation System

--- 

## Introduction

Ressources in categorisation system refers to a folder located at the top level and its function in the greater [[Categorisation System]].

--- 

## Background

Resources, now just an area next to [[Projects in Categorisation System]], [[Areas in Categorisation System]], and [[Archive in Categorisation System]], it was originally conceptualised to be the overall structure. Taking inspiration from [[Universal Decimal Classification]] I tried to capture every relevant field of my life in two layers (or more), trying to marry actionability with long term storage. Over time I reverted to the [[PARA System]], because while the 10 field layout is a good design to categorise different fields, it lacks in the actionability part.

## Exposition

#a/uP  
#a/eX 

The organization takes heavy inspiration from the [[Universal Decimal Classification]] and tries to categorize everything relevant in a hierarchical system with base 10, ranging from 0 to 9 in every layer. The numbers form an eindeutigen (unanominous?) path to the location.
