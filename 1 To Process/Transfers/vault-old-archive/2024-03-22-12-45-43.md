## The Issue

Under the current setup (unique file names, first H1 as title, inserted in alias section) it is not possible to use commas in the title as this would segment the title in the alias array.

## What To Do Instead

[[2024-03-15-15-46-53|Instead of trying to fix it by encasing the commas in '']], try a whole new approach:

1. Formulate the titles in a way that doesn't require commas (use . if no other way).
2. For listings, replace the practice of separating every element by a comma and the last by a & with separating every entry with a -.
3. An exemption to 2. is when the items aren't strictly separate but have the same reference word (as in "Leadership and Management Styles")

## Relationship to Naming the Title in the Body

As guideline 1. portrays, should titles optimally be named in a way that doesn't require commas.  
Before, when there was a & in the title I replaced it with an and in the body. I have come to the conclusion that it would be best to not change anything when naming the title in the body.
