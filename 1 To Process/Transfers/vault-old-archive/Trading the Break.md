- Buy when the price breaks the [[Resistance]]
- Sell when the price breaks the [[Support]]

Breaking essentially means that the price does not rebound from the resistance or support level but rather cuts through.

There are two ways to trade the break.

Aggressive way:

You enter every time the price convincingly breaks the resistance or support level.

Conservative way:  

After the price breaks through the resistance or support, wait for a pullback or retest of the resistance or support level and if the old resistance or support now proves to be the reverse - a new support or resistance level - you enter.
