Margin trading means borrowing money in order to open bigger positions. [[+Margin (board)]] is the amount of money that you yourself have and leverage means how much bigger of a position you are able to open. With a leverage of 50:1 and a margin requirement of 2% you could open a position of 100.000 Euro with just 2.000 Euro margin.
