# Strategy Framework

## Vision

10+ years  
Why do we exist?  
What's the dream?

## Mission

5-10 years  
What do we want to achieve in the long run?

## Key Strategies

2-3 years  
What do we need to do to be successful?  
How can we create enduring and defensible value?

The layer between the more abstract long-term goals and the concrete deliverables for the immediate future.  
Concrete and tangible but harder to achieve than the annual goals

## OKRs (annual)

1 year  
What do we need to do in the next 12 months to move this plan forward?  
Which specific results do we want to create?
