## Definition

A hammer is a [[Candlestick Patterns (board)|Candlestick Pattern]] that forms during a *downtrend* and has little or no upper shadow and a long lower shadow.

## General

It is a bullish reversal pattern that shows an end to the downtrend might be near. Do not take a hammer as sole confirmation for this but wait for other bullish signals if you want to enter a long position.

Recognition criteria for a hammer:

- long shadow is about two or three times the size of the box
- little or no upper shadow 
- the box is at the upper end of the trading range
- color of the box is not important
