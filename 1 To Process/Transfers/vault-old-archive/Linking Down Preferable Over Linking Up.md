# Linking Down Preferable Over Linking Up

## Exposition

Every note linking up leads to a more general note on-topic. These (upper) serve as overviews for all the ones below them, this is why the parent-child relationship should be expressed in the parent note. Linking up can of course also be applied in the child note (to explain something, give relational context, etcetera), but as in the general principles on linking should only occur when there is a need for it.
