# Forex Contract for Difference

---

## Definition

A contract for difference is a derivative. Similarly to a [[Forex Spread Bet]] the money you lose or win is the difference between buying and selling price.  

---

## Description

In the U.K. and EU, rolling spot FX contracts are regulated as CFDs rather than regular spot FX contracts, as the buyer has no intention of taking delivery of the underlying asset but rather wants to be exposed to the price fluctuations of the market.
