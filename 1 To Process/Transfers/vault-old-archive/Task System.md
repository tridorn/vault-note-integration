# Task System

## Introduction

The task system represents the physical landscape of “what is to do”. It aims for capturing everything, every “open loop” no matter how small (to a certain degree) and transforming it into actionable items. Here I want to give a general overview of the genesis, the main features and especially components of the whole system.

## Background

This system largely builds upon [[Getting Things Done|GTD]]. It can be seen as a direct copy as I understand it with some minor alterations here and there.

## Exposition

The main aspects of this system are of theoretical nature. It mainly defines concepts and workflows and creates a general philosophy of how to [[Inbox in Task System|capture stuff]]. The implementation based on this philosophy is based in the [[Categorisation System]].
