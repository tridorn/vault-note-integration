# Summary of a Half-Hour Timeframe Workflow

#### Before the Timeframe

1. **Review Tasks**:
	- **Check Eisenhower Matrix**: Look at tasks categorized in your four smart lists.
	- **Prioritize**: Focus first on "Important and Urgent" tasks, then "Important but Not Urgent" if no urgent tasks are pressing.

2. **Select Tasks**:
	- **Primary Task**: Choose one main task that fits within the half-hour and aligns with your priorities.
	- **Secondary Tasks**: Identify a couple of small, quick tasks as backups (if time allows).

3. **Set Objective and Expected Outcome**:
	- **Objective**: Define a clear, specific goal for the half-hour.
	- **Expected Outcome**: Describe the tangible result you aim to achieve.

4. **Update "Current" List**:
	- Add the primary task and any selected secondary tasks to the "Current" list in Apple Reminders.

#### During the Timeframe

1. **Focus on the Primary Task**:
	- Dedicate the majority of the half-hour to completing or making significant progress on the primary task.
	- Use any remaining time for secondary tasks if the primary task is finished early or if there's downtime.

2. **Track Progress**:
	- Monitor your progress towards the objective. Stay focused on the expected outcome.

#### After the Timeframe

1. **Review Achievements**:
	- **Compare Results**: Check what you accomplished against the expected outcome.
	- **Update Status**: Mark the primary task as complete if finished, or note progress if not fully completed.

2. **Reflect and Adjust**:
	- **Reflections**: Briefly note any insights, challenges, or deviations from the plan.
	- **Adjust Next Steps**: Decide whether incomplete tasks should stay in the "Current" list for the next timeframe or be moved back to their respective categories.

3. **Prepare for Next Timeframe**:
	- Repeat the process by selecting new tasks and setting a fresh objective and expected outcome.

#### End of Day Review

1. **Cleanse "Current" List**:
	- Ensure all tasks in the "Current" list are updated, completed, or moved to appropriate lists.

2. **Reflect on the Day**:
	- Summarize achievements and insights from all half-hour timeframes.
	- Adjust priorities and prepare for the next day's tasks.

### Example Timeframe

#### Before

- **Objective**: Draft key points of the client presentation.
- **Expected Outcome**: Have a detailed outline of the presentation ready.
- **Primary Task**: Prepare client presentation outline (Important and Urgent).
- **Secondary Tasks**:
  - Respond to an important email (Important and Urgent).
  - Plan the agenda for the afternoon meeting (Important but Not Urgent).
- **Update "Current" List**: Add the primary and secondary tasks.

#### During

- **Focus**: Work on drafting the presentation outline.
- **Track**: Monitor progress and switch to secondary tasks if the main task is completed early.

#### After

- **Review**:
  - Achievement: Drafted 75% of the presentation outline.
  - Update Status: Mark progress and decide to continue the task in the next timeframe if necessary.
- **Reflect and Adjust**:
  - Note challenges or insights.
  - Adjust the "Current" list accordingly.

By following this structured approach, you ensure that each half-hour is productive and aligned with your broader goals, while also maintaining flexibility to adapt to changes and new priorities.
