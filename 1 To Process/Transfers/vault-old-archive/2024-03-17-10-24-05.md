# Not Everything Captured Should Be Stored Long-term

--- 

## What it Means

While it is [[2024-03-17-09-49-56|important to capture everything one has to return to later]], this doesn't translate to that everything captured has to be stored permanently or turned into a longer lasting medium [[2024-03-17-10-01-58|when coming from drafts]]. Those thoughts of value can be stored long term, however those not useful any more, can just as easily be discarded.
