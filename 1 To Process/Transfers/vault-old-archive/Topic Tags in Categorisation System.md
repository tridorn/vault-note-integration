# Topic Tags in Categorisation System

## Definition

Topic tags are keywords assigned to content of any form to categorise it and foster searchability based on its topic

## Creating Topic Tags

Creating descriptive keywords or tags can be challenging at first, but with practice, it becomes easier. Here are some tips for generating useful tags for your notes:

1. **Think in terms of concepts**: Consider the main ideas, themes, or concepts in your note. What are the central topics or points that the note covers? Use these as tags.
	 
2. **Use keywords from the content**: Skim through the note and identify specific terms or phrases that stand out or are frequently mentioned. These can often be good candidates for tags.
	 
3. **Consider synonyms**: Think about alternative words or phrases that describe the same concept as your original tags. This can help capture a wider range of related content when searching or filtering.
	 
4. **Use broader and narrower terms**: When appropriate, use both broader and narrower terms as tags. This can help capture notes that are related at different levels of granularity.
	 
5. **Limit the number of tags**: Try to keep the number of tags per note manageable. Aim for 3 to 7 tags, but this can vary depending on the complexity of the note. Too many tags can make it difficult to organize and search your notes effectively.
	 
6. **Keep tags consistent**: Use consistent terminology and spelling across your notes. This makes it easier to find related content when searching or filtering by tags.
