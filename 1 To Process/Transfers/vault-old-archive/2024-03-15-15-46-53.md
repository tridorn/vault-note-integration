# Enclose Commas with '' in Titles

--- 

## What It Means

The reason for this is not really by choice. I use a linter to automatically format my text, on lint the title (the only H1, the note file name follows the naming scheme of date and time of creation to the second) is inserted into the property "linter-yaml-title-alias" to keep track of file naming changes and into the alias section. As the alias section follows a single line array approach that means that entries are surrounded by [] and separated by commas, effectively splitting any title with commas in it into multiple entries in the array. On file lint the linter sees "Oh, title not in alias array" and inserts another one and this ad infinitum.

## Update: Why This Approach Doesn't Work

Using this approach is impossible as when linking via Breadcrumbs in the YAML, there need to be added additional "" or it will throw an error, this however segment the link.
