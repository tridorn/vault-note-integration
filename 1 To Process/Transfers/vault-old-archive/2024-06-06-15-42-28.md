# First Definition LMS Elements

Creating a comprehensive and holistic personal productivity system involves organizing these elements into a clear structure that allows for easy navigation and practical application. Here's a suggested structure and leveling for your elements:

1. **Areas**
	- **Definition**: Broad categories representing general areas that need to be solved or generally treated.
	- **Role**: Foundation layer that identifies the key domains of your life or work.

2. **Plans**
	- **Definition**: Detailed content related to specific topics within each area, essentially brainstorming and capturing all related information.
	- **Role**: Idea generation and initial exploration phase for each area.

3. **Systems**
	- **Definition**: Formalized structures based on plans, providing a theoretical framework and foundation for addressing the areas.
	- **Role**: Development of organized methods and approaches derived from plans.

4. **Scopes**
	- **Definition**: Practical applications of systems, implementing the theoretical frameworks in real-world scenarios.
	- **Role**: Execution layer where systems are put into practice.

5. **Time Rooms**
	- **Definition**: Specific timeframes (e.g., half-hour, day, week, month) that encapsulate everything happening within that period.
	- **Role**: Temporal organization of activities and tracking of what happens within each timeframe.

6. **Situations**
	- **Definition**: Questions related to a plan or system that check if they address specific issues or scenarios.
	- **Role**: Validation and evaluation layer to ensure the plans and systems are comprehensive and effective.

7. **Schemas**
	- **Definition**: Visual representations of contexts that belong together.
	- **Role**: Visualization tool to help understand and organize the relationships between different elements.

### Proposed Structure

1. **Areas** (Top Level)
	- **Plans** (Second Level under each Area)
	  - **Systems** (Third Level under each Plan)
		 - **Scopes** (Fourth Level under each System)
		 - **Situations** (Evaluation layer parallel to Scopes)
	- **Time Rooms** (Second Level, organizing activities temporally across all areas)
	- **Schemas** (Visual representations to support all levels)

### Workflow Example

1. **Define Areas**: Identify broad categories like Work, Personal Development, Health, etc.
2. **Create Plans**: For each Area, brainstorm and document all related ideas and topics.
3. **Develop Systems**: Formulate structured approaches based on the Plans.
4. **Implement Scopes**: Apply the Systems in practical scenarios.
5. **Organize Time Rooms**: Track activities and plans within specific timeframes.
6. **Validate with Situations**: Use Situations to test and ensure Systems and Plans address all relevant issues.
7. **Use Schemas**: Create visual aids to see the connections and contexts between different elements.

By following this structure, you can ensure that each element of your productivity system is clearly defined, systematically organized, and practically applicable. This hierarchical and interconnected approach will help you maintain a comprehensive and holistic system that adapts and evolves with your needs.
