## Definition

Required Margin[^1] is the money that is set aside and “locked up” when you open a trade.

## General

### How to Calculate (per position)

If the base currency is the SAME as your account’s currency:

Required Margin = Notional Value x Margin Requirement

If the base currency is DIFFERENT from your account’s currency:

Required Margin = Notional Value x Margin Requirement x Exchange Rate Between Base Currency and Account Current  

### Also Called
