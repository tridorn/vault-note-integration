## Definition

The Stop Out Level[^1] is the specific level (%) where if your Margin Level is equal or below it, your broker will automatically start closing your positions until the Margin Level is greater than the Stop Out Level.[^2]

## General

For example, let’s say the Stop Out Level is 50%.

This means that if the Margin Level falls below 50% a Stop Out will automatically occur and the position floating the largest loss will be liquidated automatically.

This process will be repeated until the Margin Level increases to a level above 50%.

### Also called

- Liquidation Margin
- Margin Closeout
- Margin Close Out (MCO)
- Minimum Required Margin

### How to calculate

Stop Out Level = Margin Level at X%
