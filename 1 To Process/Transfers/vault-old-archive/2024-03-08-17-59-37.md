This framework is designed to be both comprehensive and adaptable, allowing for the incorporation of new categories or subcategories as needed. Each main category encompasses a broad area of life, knowledge, or activity, with subcategories providing the necessary specificity to organize information, interests, and activities effectively. The system can be further tailored to individual preferences, adding, removing, or modifying categories to suit personal or professional requirements.
