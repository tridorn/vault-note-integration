You are on the right track with naming your strategies, frameworks, and implementations. The goal is to make these names clear and descriptive so that their purpose and scope are immediately apparent. Here's some guidance on naming:

### Naming Strategies, Frameworks, and Implementations

**Strategies**:
- **Goal**: Clearly state the broader objective or purpose.
- **Example**:
  - Instead of "News Strategy," use "Staying Up-to-Date Strategy."
  - Instead of "Health Strategy," use "Improving Physical Fitness Strategy."

**Frameworks**:
- **Goal**: Describe the structured approach or methodology to achieve the strategy.
- **Example**:
  - Instead of "Exercise Framework," use "Weekly Workout Framework."
  - Instead of "Budget Framework," use "Monthly Budget Planning Framework."

**Implementations**:
- **Goal**: Specify the actionable steps or tools used to execute the framework.
- **Example**:
  - Instead of "Workout Implementation," use "Daily Exercise Routine Implementation."
  - Instead of "Savings Implementation," use "Automated Savings Plan Implementation."

### Examples for Better Understanding
