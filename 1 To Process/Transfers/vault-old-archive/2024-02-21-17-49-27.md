## Definition

Personal is a top level categorisation group in [[2024-02-19-17-25-31|Resources]]. It holds - as the name suggests - other categories related to personal issues, that is, of more private nature. In this context it can be directly contrasted to Professional #a/aL, which is also related to personal issues, but in a professional, that is, work context.
