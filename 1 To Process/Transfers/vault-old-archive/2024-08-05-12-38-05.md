Implementing the framework you described in Obsidian, a markdown-based note-taking app, involves setting up a structured and organized system that allows you to effectively plan, track, and adjust your objectives. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement this framework in Obsidian:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Vault

1. **Create a New Vault**
	- Open Obsidian and create a new vault for your personal planning framework.
	- Name the vault appropriately, e.g., "Personal Planning Framework."

2. **Folder Structure**
	- Create a folder structure to organize your notes based on the core components of your framework.

### Step 2: Create the Folder Structure

Here's a suggested folder structure to organize your framework:

```
/Personal Planning Framework
    /Objective Setting
    /Topic Categorization
    /Sub-topic Identification
    /Research and Information
    /Goal Setting
    /Action Planning
    /Resource Allocation
    /Implementation
    /Monitoring and Evaluation
    /Review and Adjustment
```

### Step 3: Set Up Templates

Using templates in Obsidian can save time and ensure consistency in your notes. You can use the Obsidian "Templates" plugin to achieve this.

1. **Enable the Templates Plugin**
	- Go to Settings > Core Plugins and enable the "Templates" plugin.

2. **Create a Templates Folder**
	- Create a folder named `/Templates` within your vault to store template files.

3. **Create Templates for Each Component**

	**Objective Setting Template**

	```markdown
   # Objective Setting

   **Objective**: 

   **Description**: 

   **Why is this important?**:

   **Expected Outcomes**: 

   **Timeframe**: 

   **Notes**: 
   ```

	**Topic Categorization Template**

	```markdown
   # Topic Categorization

   **Main Topic**: 

   **Sub-topics**: 

   **Description**: 

   **Notes**: 
   ```

	**Sub-topic Identification Template**

	```markdown
   # Sub-topic Identification

   **Sub-topic**: 

   **Details**: 

   **Related Goals**: 

   **Notes**: 
   ```

	**Research and Information Template**

	```markdown
   # Research and Information

   **Sub-topic**: 

   **Sources and Resources**: 

   **Key Insights**: 

   **Questions**: 

   **Next Steps**: 
   ```

	**Goal Setting Template**

	```markdown
   # Goal Setting

   **Sub-topic**: 

   **Goal**: 

   **Short-term Milestones**: 

   **Long-term Milestones**: 

   **Criteria for Success**: 

   **Notes**: 
   ```

	**Action Planning Template**

	```markdown
   # Action Planning

   **Sub-topic**: 

   **Goal**: 

   **Action Steps**: 

   **Timeline**: 

   **Resources Required**: 

   **Potential Challenges**: 

   **Notes**: 
   ```

	**Resource Allocation Template**

	```markdown
   # Resource Allocation

   **Sub-topic**: 

   **Goal**: 

   **Resources Needed**: 

   **Budget**: 

   **Tools and Technologies**: 

   **Notes**: 
   ```

	**Implementation Template**

	```markdown
   # Implementation

   **Sub-topic**: 

   **Goal**: 

   **Actions Taken**: 

   **Progress**: 

   **Adjustments Made**: 

   **Notes**: 
   ```

	**Monitoring and Evaluation Template**

	```markdown
   # Monitoring and Evaluation

   **Sub-topic**: 

   **Goal**: 

   **Metrics**: 

   **Progress**: 

   **Challenges**: 

   **Achievements**: 

   **Notes**: 
   ```

	**Review and Adjustment Template**

	```markdown
   # Review and Adjustment

   **Sub-topic**: 

   **Goal**: 

   **Review Date**: 

   **Progress**: 

   **Areas for Improvement**: 

   **Adjustments Needed**: 

   **Next Steps**: 

   **Notes**: 
   ```

### Step 4: Creating Notes Using Templates

1. **Create a New Note**
	- Navigate to the appropriate folder for the component you're working on.
	- Create a new note using the template for that component. Use the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`) to insert a template.

2. **Fill in the Details**
	- Use the templates to guide your thinking and planning for each component.
	- Make sure to update and maintain notes as you progress through your objectives.

### Step 5: Use Linking and Tags for Organization

1. **Linking Notes**
	- Use Obsidian's note-linking feature to connect related notes and sub-topics.
	- For example, link goals to related research and information notes.

	```markdown
   [[Sub-topic Identification/Exercise]]
   ```

2. **Tagging**
	- Use tags to categorize notes by status or priority (e.g., `#ongoing`, `#completed`, `#high-priority`).

	```markdown
   #ongoing #high-priority
   ```

### Step 6: Utilize Obsidian Features for Visualization

1. **Graph View**
	- Use Obsidian's Graph View to visualize the connections between notes and identify relationships between topics.

2. **Backlinks**
	- Take advantage of backlinks to track references and see how different components are interconnected.

### Step 7: Review and Maintain the System

1. **Regular Updates**
	- Schedule regular reviews to update your notes, track progress, and make necessary adjustments.

2. **Continuous Improvement**
	- Continuously refine your templates and note-taking processes based on your evolving needs and goals.

### Example Workflow in Obsidian

#### 1. **Objective Setting**

- **Objective**: Improve overall health.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive framework within Obsidian that helps you plan, track, and adjust your objectives systematically. This approach leverages Obsidian's powerful features, such as templates, note linking, and graph visualization, to ensure that your personal planning is organized and efficient.
