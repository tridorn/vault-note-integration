# About New System

## Exposition

I have to start to look at the time frames (especially half an hour) less as unmovable units in which time is segmented and focus more on the real time.

The half an hour time frames are less of a task by themselves and more spaces in which somethings happens with the review and planning at the end, interrupting the "nothingness".

Plan and review are the anchor points and as opposed to being "inflated up", the space in between is "deflated down" or rather, level.
