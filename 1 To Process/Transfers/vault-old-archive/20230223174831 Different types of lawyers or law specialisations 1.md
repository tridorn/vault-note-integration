We can advise on many different fields.  
In my head we will be some sort of a search/advice engine for legal related tasks.  
To visualize: The product site does not look like a common chatbot, not even necessarily like Google. In my vision there is the text input field somewhere at the bottom but the rest of the site is designed in such a way (at least on computer) that there is no scrolling needed when result are presented. Maybe the text output is at the top and different boxes are placed below. These boxes are the alternative "findings" or services.  
At first I only thought of presenting our own services (document generation etc.) but something very exciting is to go full on "search engine" and allow companies to place legal


Every service is to be handled with precaution as you may need a notar to draft certain documents.
