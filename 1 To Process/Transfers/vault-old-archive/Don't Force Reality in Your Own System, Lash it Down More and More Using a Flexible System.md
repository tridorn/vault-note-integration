# Don't Force Reality in Your Own System, Lash it Down More and More Using a Flexible System

#a/eX

- I like order
- structure system generalising and based on perceived reality
- better flexible system to reduce volatility of world to minimum without having to go back and change everything if either system proves bad or other change
- don't try to force reality in the steucture of your own system based on your own perceived reality but rather put restrictions on chaos and tame or fixate it more and more (zusammenziehen)
