# Portfolio Allocation

To implement a portfolio allocation of 60% equities, 20% bonds, 10% alternative investments, and 10% cash, you would ideally aim to maintain these ratios across your entire financial portfolio rather than in each individual account. This holistic approach allows you to optimize each account for its specific purpose while still achieving your overall asset allocation goals. Here's how you can manage this:

### 1. **Overall Portfolio Allocation**

The overall target allocation of 60% equities, 20% bonds, 10% alternative investments, and 10% cash should be viewed at the aggregate level. Each account doesn't need to mirror this allocation but should contribute to achieving it on the whole.

### 2. **Implementing Allocation Across Accounts**

#### **Primary Checking and Savings Accounts (N26 & ING)**

- **Cash Allocation:** These accounts will primarily manage your liquidity and cash holdings, which make up 10% of your overall portfolio. This includes your emergency fund and other liquid reserves.
- **Purpose:** Daily expenses, savings for short-term goals, and an emergency fund.

#### **Investment Accounts (Trade Republic and Flatex)**

- **Trade Republic (Long-term, Stable Investments):**
  - **Equities:** Focus on broad market ETFs that cover large-cap, global indices.
  - **Bonds:** Include government and corporate bond ETFs.
  - **Allocation Strategy:** This account could hold a larger portion of the bonds and stable, blue-chip equities to maintain stability.
  
- **Flatex (Active, Tactical Investments):**
  - **Equities:** Could be more focused on sector-specific or high-growth equities.
  - **Alternative Investments:** This account can be used for investing in commodities, REITs, or potentially cryptocurrencies if that fits your risk profile.
  - **Allocation Strategy:** This account is more dynamic and can hold the more speculative parts of your equity allocation and your entire alternative investments allocation.

### 3. **Maintaining And Adjusting the Portfolio Balance**

- **Regular Reviews:** Conduct at least quarterly reviews of your portfolio to check how the actual allocations compare with your target allocations. This is especially important if you actively trade in one of your accounts, as it can quickly skew your intended asset distribution.
  
- **Rebalancing:** If any category deviates significantly from your targets (a common rule of thumb is a deviation of 5% or more), rebalance by either transferring funds between accounts, buying or selling assets, or adjusting your future contributions.
- **Contributions and Withdrawals:** Direct new savings and investment contributions into categories that are underrepresented according to your strategic allocation. For instance, if your bond allocation is low, your next investment could go into bond ETFs in your Trade Republic account.
- **Using Dividends and Gains:** Reinvest dividends and capital gains to help maintain your desired allocation. For example, reinvesting dividends from equities into bonds if your equity allocation becomes too high.

### 4. **Integrating Active Trading**

- **Risk Management:** Since active trading can lead to rapid changes in asset allocation, it's essential to use risk management techniques like stop-loss orders or limit orders to protect from significant losses.
  
- **Separate Budgeting:** Consider setting aside a specific portion of your equity allocation for active trading, which can help contain the impact of trading on your overall portfolio structure.

By viewing your allocation strategy across the entire spectrum of your finances rather than compartmentalizing each account, you allow for more flexibility in how you manage each investment or bank account. This holistic view also helps in managing risks and taking advantage of opportunities without deviating from your overall financial goals.
