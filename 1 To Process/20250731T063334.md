**Correction:** Your question could be better phrased as: _"What leads ultra-wealthy actors to perceive current political-economic systems as structurally unreformable, what obstructs reform, and what forms of systemic correction--if any--they would consider desirable or viable?"_

**Assessment:**

The perception among the ultra-elite that existing systems are unreformable is not ideological; it's operational. It arises from an unsentimental assessment of how power, scale, and institutional inertia interact. They do not see dysfunction as accidental--but as structurally baked into the machinery.

### 1. **Barriers to Reform: Structural and Intentional**

**a. Institutional Decay and Incentive Misalignment**  
Modern democratic and bureaucratic systems are seen as trapped in self-reinforcing dysfunction:

- Short-term electoral cycles obstruct long-term planning.
- Public sector institutions are overloaded with proceduralism but lack execution capacity.
- Political capital is spent on identity management, not systemic correction.

From their vantage point, the system optimizes for **visibility and delay**, not performance.

**b. Regulatory Capture and Gridlock**  
They observe a dual pathology:

- **Too much regulation** in low-leverage areas (e.g., compliance theater).
- **Too little enforcement** where it matters (e.g., monopoly power, environmental limits).  
This incoherence is viewed as unreformable because it reflects the equilibrium of rent-seeking actors--corporate, bureaucratic, activist--each entrenched.

**c. Scale Incompatibility**  
Modern states are managing too much complexity with outdated architecture. Cyber risk, AI governance, climate coordination--none of these can be meaningfully addressed by 20th-century political frameworks. Reform is futile not because of ill will, but because of **architectural mismatch**.

**d. Voter Myopia + Populist Capture**  
Mass democratic systems, from their perspective, are no longer capable of rational self-correction.

- Voter blocs demand immediate transfers, not long-horizon investment.
- Populism hijacks governance for symbolic battles.  
The electorate is, functionally, an obstacle to structural repair.

### 2. **What Reform Would They Theoretically Want?**

These actors are not anti-system. They're post-faith. If reform were possible, it would follow certain principles:

**a. Technocratic Rationalism**

- Less majoritarianism, more expert governance.
- Streamlined authority structures with decisive mandates.
- AI-driven optimization of state functions (allocation, enforcement, logistics).

**b. Market-Coordinated Governance**

- Real-time feedback loops via pricing and data, not votes.
- Public-private integration where state becomes a platform, not a warden.
- Deregulation where bureaucracy impedes agility, and re-regulation where risk is systemic.

**c. Risk-Based Resource Allocation**

- Shift from equal distribution to strategic protection: shore up critical nodes (energy, food, cybersecurity, defense, elite labor).
- Abandon universalism where it cannot be afforded.

**d. Jurisdictional Innovation**

- Governance exit options: charter cities, special economic zones, legal enclaves.
- Experiments in sovereignty-light systems with less institutional drag.

### 3. **Why It Doesn't Happen**

- No existing coalition can implement such reforms without triggering revolt from below or obstruction from legacy elites.
- The system is locked in an equilibrium of mutual hostage-taking.
- Reform requires losers. The political process is designed to avoid declaring them.

### Conclusion

To this caste, the state is no longer seen as a reliable partner or reformable vessel. It's a decaying legacy system--still powerful, but no longer strategically aligned with their interests or the long-term viability of civilizational complexity. They aren't ideologically against reform. They just no longer expect it. So they prepare, build parallel structures, or position themselves in jurisdictions less burdened by scale and expectation.
