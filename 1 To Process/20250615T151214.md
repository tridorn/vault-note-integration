### VII. **Meta-System Design**

_Outlines the self-regulatory layer of the architecture. This is the machinery responsible for adapting, scaling, auditing, and evolving the system. It governs how the structure itself is modified, replicated, or retired. Without a meta-system, all evolution becomes discretionary and reactive._

* * *

#### 7.1 **System Entry & Exit Protocols**

| Process | Trigger | Governance | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Mission Launch** | Issuance of Mission Order by SO | Must include FO assignment, resource envelope, scope boundaries, sprint count | 
| **Mission Termination** | End-of-cycle or premature termination (via FO/SO) | Requires closeout review; outputs delivered to IH and SO | 
| **Program Formation** | 2+ Missions require thematic continuity | Approved by SO; resource logic reviewed with SD | 
| **Program Retirement** | No active missions remaining; review complete | SO formally archives program and absorbs learning | 
| **Campaign Launch** | Council ratifies strategic objective with capital envelope | SO constructs Campaign Plan; declared in public doctrine | 
| **Campaign Termination** | Objectives achieved, or invalidated by market or doctrine | Reviewed in Quarterly Campaign Review; terminated only via Council vote | 
| **SD Lifecycle** | Created/merged/sunset by functional demand or redundancy | Strategic Council authorisation required | 
* * *

#### 7.2 **Scaling Logic**

System must scale both horizontally (more Missions, Programs) and vertically (more complexity, higher ambition). Scaling is not linear--it must follow thresholds.

| Trigger | Scaling Action | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **>5 Parallel Missions in a Theme** | Form Program to coordinate dependencies | 
| **>2 Active Campaigns in Same Domain** | Council must appoint Domain Lead and approve resource segmentation logic | 
| **Repeated Doctrine Deviations in Missions** | Doctrine Cell investigates; triggers doctrine fork or evolution | 
| **Persistent SD Bottlenecks** | Capacity threshold triggers SD split, staff augmentation, or rechartering | 
| **New Geography or Market** | Requires new Campaign charter; FO pool must be reviewed for domain coverage | 

Scaling must always come _after_ the structure to support it is provisioned. Premature scaling introduces silent failure.

* * *

#### 7.3 **Audit & Self-Diagnosis Mechanisms**

The structure cannot rely on external consultants or informal perception for performance checks. It must audit itself.

| Mechanism | Frequency | Owner | Scope | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Governance Audit** | Annual (Season-end) | Independent Audit Unit (or designated SO cell) | Review all roles, mandates, rituals, escalations | 
| **Mission Hygiene Review** | Every second Sprint | FO | Are roles adhered to? Is sprint logic respected? Are reviews happening? | 
| **Cross-Mission Pattern Scan** | Monthly | IH + SO Ops | Identify repeating coordination failures, escalation patterns | 
| **Support Division SLA Review** | Quarterly | SD Lead + SO + FOs | Review delivery lags, complaint volume, risk exposure | 
| **Doctrine Coherence Scan** | Season Reset | Doctrine Cell | Is doctrine causing more harm than benefit? Are rules outdated? | 

If a unit or function fails its audit two cycles in a row, Council intervention is mandated.

* * *

#### 7.4 **Doctrine Governance Process**

Doctrine is the binding contract of your system. Its governance must be formal, versioned, and resilient against ad hoc edits.

| Rule | Logic | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Doctrine can only change at Season boundaries** | Prevents mid-mission instability | 
| **All proposed changes require structured Doctrine Change Requests (DCRs)** | Template includes: observed friction, origin, recurrence, affected units | 
| **Doctrine has semantic versioning (`v3.1.2`)** | Major (structure), minor (rules), patch (language) | 
| **DCR Review Board includes Doctrine Cell + rotating FOs and Mission Leads** | Ensures grounded revisions, not academic edits | 
| **Council ratifies only major and structural changes** | Minor and patch releases are managed within SO unless explicitly escalated | 
* * *

#### 7.5 **Digital Infrastructure Binding**

The system must be _enforced_ through tooling, not merely described in documents. Every key unit, artefact, and flow must map to a platform.

| System Component | Digital Binding Requirement | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Missions** | Managed in project system with ID, timeframe, FO linkage, scorecard field | 
| **Doctrine** | Version-controlled public repository, with diffs and changelog | 
| **Sprint Logs / FO Reports** | Filed in structured dashboards with search + analytics layer | 
| **Escalations** | Logged in ticketing system; tagged by type, urgency, resolution time | 
| **Reviews & Rituals** | Calendarized in shared system; absence = policy breach | 
| **IH Dashboards** | Pull from data lake of mission metrics, escalations, external signals | 
| **Role Directory** | Each seat in the structure has a visible, scoped role file + current assignee | 

No "shadow work" or ghost units. The map is the territory. If it's not in the system, it doesn't exist.

### Final Summary of Part VII

The meta-system is the _self-awareness layer_ of your organization. It is what allows doctrine to evolve without chaos, structure to grow without entropy, and failures to be diagnosed without scapegoating. Without it, no matter how brilliant the structure, the system will become obsolete under its own weight.

This concludes the documentation schema.

You now possess a **complete top-layer operating doctrine**--not of how people work, but of how the system governs itself. All artefact design, project tooling, and onboarding now flows from this architecture.
