# ProofGreen – Foundational Brand Guide (v0.1)

---
## 1. Brand Name  
**ProofGreen**  
*Why this name?*  
• "Proof" underlines our core moat: indisputable evidence.  
• "Green" signals sustainability without niche‑tech jargon.  
• Eight letters, two syllables – easy to pronounce in English and German.  
• proofgreen.io + proofgreen.de are unregistered (checked 28 Apr 2025).  

**Alternative short‑list (keep in reserve)**  
1. Verdify  
2. GreenLedger  
3. ClearCarbon  

---
## 2. One‑Line Promise (external headline)  
> *“We make green loans for small businesses fast, cheap, and safe.”*

---
## 3. Tagline Options  
1. *Evidence that unlocks green capital.*  
2. *Green finance, proven.*  
3. *Compliance you can bank on.*  

---
## 4. Core Values (internal compass)  
| Value | One‑word cue | Behaviour in practise |
|-------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Clarity | "Show" | Strip jargon; visual proofs over prose. |
| Proof | "Substantiate" | Every claim links to data or regulation. |
| Speed | "Now" | Ship features in weekly increments. |
| Integrity | "Trust" | Zero grey‑area marketing; no greenwash. |

---
## 5. Visual Identity  
### Logo Concept  
*Lock‑up:* stylised tick‑mark inside a rounded square → symbolises "verified" document; square corner subtly clipped to form a leaf.  
Use with wordmark **ProofGreen** set in SemiBold.

### Colour Palette  
| Role | HEX | RGB | Usage |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| Primary Deep Green | **#14532D** | 20 83 45 | Buttons, headings, icon fills |
| Accent Mint | **#34D399** | 52 211 153 | Links, active states, graphs |
| Neutral Dark | #1F2937 | 31 41 55 | Body text |
| Neutral Light | #F9FAFB | 249 250 251 | Backgrounds |
| Warning | #FBBF24 | 251 191 36 | Alerts (performance drift) |

### Typography  
| Use | Font | Source |
|-----|------|--------|
| Headlines | **Inter** SemiBold | Google Fonts – open licence |
| Body | **Inter** Regular | Same family for design simplicity |

---
## 6. Voice & Tone  
*Voice:* Direct, authoritative, measured optimism.  
*Tone rules:*  
• Short sentences.  
• Active verbs.  
• Avoid buzzwords; explain if unavoidable.  
• Never over‑promise; show *how* not *hype*.

**Example before/after**  
> *Before:* "Our groundbreaking platform delivers unprecedented sustainability insights."  
> *After:* "ProofGreen gives banks the evidence regulators ask for, in one click."  

---
## 7. Boilerplate (100‑word press bio)  
**ProofGreen** is a Berlin‑based fintech that makes it effortless for small and mid‑sized businesses to fund green upgrades. Our platform collects financial and energy data, matches projects with public guarantees, and produces regulator‑grade loan files that banks can approve in days. Continuous smart‑meter telemetry keeps every stakeholder – from borrower to regulator – confident the savings are real. ProofGreen turns compliance from paperwork into proof.
