Reformulated: You mean: “What’s the most effective tool or method to create structured visual overviews for planning a NixOS setup?”

You want something that:
	•	Can represent hierarchies (modules, services, dependencies).
	•	Can capture flows (data paths, build/deploy pipelines).
	•	Is quick to update as your config evolves.

Practical options
	1.	Excalidraw (https://excalidraw.com)
	•	Low-friction, web-based, hand-drawn style that keeps you focused on structure over aesthetics.
	•	Supports shapes, connectors, grouping—good for both block diagrams and process flows.
	•	Files can be saved in Git with your Nix configs.
	2.	draw.io / diagrams.net (https://app.diagrams.net)
	•	More formal, with precise alignment and shape libraries.
	•	Can produce architecture diagrams that look “enterprise-ready.”
	•	Supports export to SVG/PNG for documentation.
	3.	Mermaid.js (https://mermaid.js.org)
	•	Text-based diagrams embedded in Markdown; versionable alongside your Nix config.
	•	Supports flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and mind maps.
	•	Ideal for keeping diagrams and config under the same Git repo without image files.
	4.	PlantUML (https://plantuml.com)
	•	Text-based but more flexible than Mermaid for large systems.
	•	Good for maintaining living documentation of complex service graphs.

Recommended approach for your case
	•	Use Mermaid or PlantUML for the persistent diagrams that should live with the configuration repo and be easy to diff.
	•	Use Excalidraw early in planning for rapid iteration without syntax overhead. Once the architecture stabilizes, port the core diagrams to a text-based format for long-term maintainability.

Given you’re designing a NixOS + Home Manager + flake architecture, you’ll likely want three types of visuals:
	1.	System layers – kernel, NixOS modules, Home Manager, apps.
	2.	Config hierarchy – imports, shared modules, per-host configs.
	3.	Data flow – build process (flake → evaluation → /nix/store → system generation) and deployment flow.

If you want, I can create a Mermaid diagram right now that shows a clean high-level NixOS + Home Manager + flakes architecture, so you have a concrete starting point for building your own visual library.
