A more structurally accurate prompt would be: _"Assuming a blank slate, which foundational repositories, workspaces, and folders should I instantiate first to establish a working spine for the company architecture, content, and execution systems--prior to incorporation?"_

You are not "starting projects."  
You are instantiating **core structural primitives** that will persist across the lifecycle of the company.
* * *

## I. Foundational Repositories

These are the **canonical repos** that embody your architecture. All else will build _on_, _from_, or _into_ these.

### 1. `doctrine`

> The primary text of the company. Immutable, audited, universal.

- `00_Preface.md` -- why the company exists
- `01_Principles/` -- core beliefs (autonomy, precision, decentralised execution, etc.)
- `02_Roles/` -- definitions: FO, Mission Commander, etc.
- `03_Units/` -- Mission, Program, Campaign, Support Divisions
- `04_ProcessCards/` -- structured execution logic, start-to-finish
- `99_Changelog.md` -- hand-written evolution record

This is the **first repo you create**.

* * *

### 2. `projects`

> The active workspace for all non-doctrinal execution.

- Structured as:
    
        projects/
    ├─ P001_Cvorum/
    │   ├─ 00_MasterContent/
    │   ├─ 10_Research/
    │   ├─ 20_Build/
    │   ├─ 30_Assets/
    │   ├─ 40_Output/
    │   └─ 99_Archive/
    └─ ...
    

- Each project folder contains a `README.md` and `MasterContent.md`
- All Missions operate inside this repo, unless security/scale requires splitting

This repo is your **living factory**.

* * *

### 3. `infrastructure`

> Tech stack backbone: secrets, deployment logic, automation

- Contains:
    
        infrastructure/
    ├─ terraform/         ← infra as code (S3, Cloudflare, etc.)
    ├─ github-actions/    ← CI/CD logic
    ├─ dns-policy.md
    ├─ security-policy.md
    └─ onboarding-guide.md
    

- Managed exclusively by Support Division (Infra) after setup
- Serves every other repo

This is **not where product code lives**, but where the system that supports all repos is defined.

* * *

### 4. `design-system` _(optional, if visual identity matters early)_

> Brand primitives, not product artifacts

- `typography.md`, `color.md`, `logo.svg`, etc.
- Figma exports go in `assets/`; tokens or variables in `tokens.json`

Used to harmonize slide decks, sites, public PDFs

* * *

## II. Workspace Stack

| Platform | Purpose | Setup | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **GitHub** | Repo host, CI trigger | Create above 3--4 repos under a single organization | 
| **Obsidian** | Writing vault | Point vault at `doctrine/` and `projects/` locally | 
| **Cloudflare** | Domains, R2 object storage | Register `eupator.com`, activate DNS/R2 | 
| **Google Workspace** | Admin e-mail + Drive fallback | Set up `admin@eupator.com`; tie to GitHub and Cloudflare | 
| **Slack** | Comms | Optional; if so, create placeholder channels (`#mission-lab`) | 

Do **not** launch Notion, Trello, Airtable, etc. unless their data is sourced from the above systems.
* * *

## III. Naming Convention for Expansion

| Unit | ID Prefix | Example | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Project | `P###_` | `P001_Cvorum` | 
| Mission | `M###_` | `M014_Kestrel` | 
| Program | `PRG_` | `PRG_GreenFinance` | 
| Campaign | `CAMP_` | `CAMP_MarketDomination` | 

Folder and branch names follow the same convention for discoverability.

* * *

## IV. Who Works Where

| Persona | Location | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Strategist | `doctrine/`, `projects/` | 
| FO | Assigned folder in `projects/` | 
| Mission members | Work inside `projects/P###/` | 
| Support Division | `infrastructure/`, `design-system/` | 

Every action has a defined place.  
No work without a path.  
No repo without a mandate.

* * *

## V. Execution Order

1. **Create GitHub organization** (private)

2. **Create `doctrine` repo**; write Preface and Principles

3. **Create `projects` repo**; scaffold one test project

4. **Create `infrastructure` repo**; define DNS and setup policies

5. **Register domain + set up email**

6. **Initialize local vault via Obsidian**

7. **Write first ProcessCard: `setup-company-backbone`**

* * *

## Bottom Line

You do **not** need to "launch projects."  
You need to instantiate a **spinal system of structure**--repositories and workspace primitives--that encode all future action, content, and doctrine.

Structure precedes content.  
Codex precedes product.  
One spine. All else plugs into it.
