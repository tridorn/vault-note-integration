love this—here’s a full “micro-product lab” plan that turns your weekend builds into a repeatable, money-making cadence without killing the fun.

Micro-product lab: 12-week calendar (Europe/Zurich)

Ground rules
	•	Hybrid domain strategy (recommended): buy one umbrella domain (e.g., yourname.dev or yourstudio.co). Launch new experiments on subdomains (locker.yourname.dev). If one hits, graduate it to its own domain later.
	•	Personal brand first: everything links back to yourname.dev/projects. You’re the through-line across experiments.
	•	Keep cost trivial: Vercel (Hobby), Supabase/Neon (free tier), Plausible/Umami (analytics), Stripe. Domains: 10–30 CHF/yr.

Key metrics (simple and enough)
	•	Activation: % of signups who complete the 1 core action within 24h.
	•	Conversion: % of activated users who pay in the first 7 days.
	•	Retention: % returning on day 7 (or repeating the core action).
	•	Traffic: unique visitors/week.

Graduation gates (decide every 2–4 weeks)
	•	Graduate (buy its own domain & double down) if ANY:
① ≥ 5 paying customers, or ② ≥ 50 weekly active + ≥ 25% activation, or ③ ≥ 5% free→paid conversion.
	•	Park (minimal upkeep) if some traffic/usage but no pay yet.
	•	Kill (archive & redirect) if < 100 uniques and < 10% activation after 3 weeks of honest promotion.

Week-by-week cadence (4 launches, measured & sane)

Week 1 — Launch #1 (ship in 2 days)
	•	Pick a tiny, buyer-shaped problem (e.g., Paid Link Locker for creators).
	•	Build on locker.yourname.dev. Wire Stripe Checkout (one price). Add PostHog + Sentry.
	•	Landing page copy: pain → benefit → CTA.
	•	Announce once (your X/LinkedIn) + 1 niche community + 10 targeted DMs.
	•	Define the core action (e.g., “created a paid link”).

Week 2 — Observe & iterate #1
	•	Improve onboarding friction (one small change/day).
	•	Ship 1 retention loop (e.g., email “your link got 3 clicks”).
	•	Re-post a progress update + 5 new DMs.
	•	Record metrics Fri–Sun; snapshot on Sunday night.

Week 3 — Decision gate #1
	•	If graduate: buy domain, set up redirect, add one “pro” feature.
	•	If park: freeze feature work, keep bugfixes only.
	•	If kill: export data, email users, redirect subdomain to your projects page.

Week 4 — Launch #2
	•	New idea, same stack. Example: AI FAQ Search for small sites.
	•	Launch on faqs.yourname.dev. Repeat launch playbook (1 channel + 10 DMs).
	•	Add simple usage cap so a handful of users can pay immediately.

Week 5 — Observe & iterate #2
	•	Tighten copy, add one small “aha” animation or empty-state.
	•	Publish a <90s Loom demo; post once.

Week 6 — Decision gate #2
	•	Apply the same Graduate/Park/Kill rules. If one product already looks best, start thinking “own domain + nicer logo”.

Week 7 — Launch #3
	•	Example: Feedback Widget (embeddable button + dashboard).
	•	feedback.yourname.dev, same instrumentation, same launch rhythm.

Week 8 — Observe & iterate #3
	•	Add 1 integration that your first users asked for (e.g., Slack or email).

Week 9 — Decision gate #3
	•	If none are winners yet, pick one to push for two more weeks. Pause the rest.

Week 10 — Launch #4 or Double-Down
	•	If you’ve got momentum: double-down on the leader (pricing test + polish).
	•	If not: one more compact launch (e.g., Personal Data Journal at journal.yourname.dev).

Week 11 — Consolidate for revenue
	•	For the leader: improve pricing page, add yearly plan, tighten onboarding.
	•	Migrate to own domain if graduated; add favicon/logo; clean 404/Terms/Privacy.

Week 12 — Sunset & Storytelling
	•	Shut down losers gracefully (export/delete, redirect).
	•	Write a public recap: what you launched, numbers, learnings.
	•	Ask for intros: “Who else has this problem? Reply/DM.”

⸻

Domain & branding playbook
	•	Buy one umbrella domain now. Create /projects listing with badges: “Active / Parked / Archived”.
	•	New build: subdomain first (newtool.yourname.dev).
	•	Graduates: buy a clean .com/.app (or niche TLD), migrate DNS, set 301 from subdomain.
	•	Kills: 301 subdomain → /projects. Let the dedicated domain expire (or park) unless you plan a resale.

⸻

Launch playbook (repeatable, <2 hours each time)
	1.	Pricing: one plan only (e.g., 10 CHF/mo or 20 CHF one-time).
	2.	Landing copy (pasteable structure):
	•	Headline: “Stop [pain] in [n] minutes.”
	•	Sub: “For [who] who [context], get [result] without [annoyance].”
	•	CTA: “Try free” or “Start for 10 CHF”.
	•	Proof: 3 bullets or a 60–90s Loom.
	3.	Channels: your X/LinkedIn + 1 community where the pain exists.
	4.	DM script (short):
“Hey [Name]—you mentioned struggling with [pain]. I built a tiny tool that [benefit]. 2-min demo: [link]. Want early access? Happy to comp if you’ll give blunt feedback.”

⸻

Minimal compliance/ops (don’t overthink)
	•	Terms/Privacy: generate, then edit for accuracy. Link from footer.
	•	Support: one real inbox (e.g., hello@yourname.dev).
	•	Data export/delete: a simple button or “email me to delete”; actually honor it.
	•	Status/uptime: optional; at minimum set Sentry alerts to your email.

⸻

Sunset checklist (copy/paste)
	•	Email users 7 days ahead: plain, honest note + export link + refund if needed.
	•	Disable signups; leave read-only for a week.
	•	Take a backup; then delete data.
	•	301 subdomain → /projects.
	•	Post a short public learnings thread. Done.

⸻

Your 3 levers each week
	•	Friction down: 1 change that gets new users to the core action faster.
	•	Trust up: 1 change that makes paying feel safer (clarity, refund note, testimonials).
	•	Visibility up: 1 post/DM/demo that puts it in front of the right people.

If you want, tell me the umbrella domain you’re leaning toward and which idea you want for Launch #1. I’ll hand you a tailored checklist for this Monday–Sunday (Aug 11–17) with exact commands, copy you can paste, and the “go/no-go” numbers for Sunday night.
