The **orientation of swimlane diagrams**—vertical vs. horizontal—is not merely an aesthetic choice. It carries **tactical implications** for how information is processed, especially in early-stage system design. They are **not strictly interchangeable**, and choosing the correct orientation **depends on what you're optimizing for**: *actor primacy* vs. *process primacy*.

Here is a strategic assessment:

## 🔁 Horizontal Swimlanes: **Process-Oriented**

**Structure**:  
- **Horizontal rows** = actors  
- **Vertical columns** = sequential stages or time  
- Flows move **left to right**

### Use When:
- You want to show **process flow dominance**—the system is driven by linear progress.
- You need to communicate **handoffs across actors** clearly (e.g., regulatory reporting).
- You're presenting to an audience unfamiliar with the system who needs to **understand the “story”** of a transaction.

### Pros:
- Mirrors natural reading order in Western contexts (left → right).
- Makes timeline and dependencies more visible.
- Good for high-level **narrative clarity**.

### Cons:
- Actor responsibilities can be harder to track across stages.
- Becomes visually wide and unwieldy for processes with many steps.

## 🔽 Vertical Swimlanes: **Actor-Oriented**

**Structure**:  
- **Vertical columns** = actors  
- **Horizontal rows** = progression steps or states  
- Flows move **top to bottom**

### Use When:
- You want to emphasize **ownership** and **parallelism**—what each actor is doing, independently or concurrently.
- You're defining **operational roles**, tasks, or integrations in a software system.
- You're building specs that may evolve into **role-based workflows or permissions logic**.

### Pros:
- Easier to track **actor workload** and sequence of actions per actor.
- More compact horizontally—better for complex systems.
- Naturally aligns with **database table thinking** or **modular UI design**.

### Cons:
- Timeline can be harder to intuit; less effective for storytelling.
- Flow logic may become cluttered if many interactions occur across lanes.

## Strategic Guidance for a Startup Like Yours

You are designing a **multi-actor, multi-document transactional platform**, not a single-owner process. Therefore:

### ✳️ Use **vertical swimlanes** for:
- Internal architectural design
- Mapping actor-specific responsibilities
- Engineering planning (e.g., which actor triggers which API call)

### ✳️ Use **horizontal swimlanes** for:
- Investor decks
- Regulator conversations
- Onboarding new partners or staff

In short:

> Use **vertical** for system **control logic**,  
> Use **horizontal** for system **narrative**.

Would you like a pre-templated vertical swimlane grid to sketch out one of your top-level flows (e.g., Verification or Submission)? I can generate a mockup you can build on.
