*Correction → A more perspicuous request could have been:*  
> “Forge a **unified role-and-assignment architecture** that (i) integrates the Officer Corps, Specialist & Innovation tracks, and the attachment taxonomies; (ii) institutionalises a meritocratic, up-or-out talent engine; and (iii) embeds a ‘shadow-board’ of young officers as a perpetual leadership crucible.”

## Ⅰ Principia: four axioms for the talent machine  

| Axiom | Dictum |
|-------|--------|
| **Clarity** | Every billet has a grade, remit, term-length, and exit criterion. |
| **Contestability** | Advancement is earned through visible scorecards, not tenure. |
| **Osmosis** | Officers, specialists, and innovators cross-pollinate by design. |
| **Succession Loop** | A “shadow-board” continuously rehearses tomorrow’s governors. |

## Ⅱ Unified Talent Lattice (grades & tracks)

```
GRADE  │  OFFICER TRACK                │ SPECIALIST TRACK             │ INNOVATOR TRACK
───────┼───────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────
O-0    │ Probe Officer  (Rot. AMU Lead)│—                             │— 
O-1    │ Field Officer  (LFO)          │Senior Practitioner           │Experiment Conductor
O-2    │ Senior Field / TF Commander   │Principal SME / Guild Chair   │Innovation Producer
O-3    │ Staff Officer  (AGS Cell Lead)│Distinguished Expert          │Venture Architect
O-4    │ Senior Staff / Strat-Cmd XO   │Fellow                        │Startup GM
O-5    │ Command Officer               │Domain Fellow-Emeritus        │Portfolio Director
O-6    │ Councillor (Leadership Council)│— (can be co-opted)          │— (can be co-opted)
```

*Horizontal oscillations* (↔) permitted at grades **O-2 to O-4**; each jump resets the **time-in-grade clock**.

## Ⅲ Assignment Grammar (who belongs where, how long)

| Token | Semantic | Max Term | Typical Host Nodes |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------------|
| **[C]** Core Membership | full voting rights | mission horizon (AMU) or indeterminate (staff) | all nodes |
| **[R]** Rotational   | growth immersion     | 1–3 sprints        | AMUs, AGS cells |
| **[F]** Flash        | crisis intervention  | ≤ 72 h             | AMU / OCD |
| **[E]** Embedded Contractor | paid gap-fill | sprint bundle      | AMU |
| **[FS]** Fractional Specialist | part-time exec / auditor | 6-mo renewable | LC, OCD, AGS |
| **[P]** Partner-AMU  | external pod         | contract SOW       | Task-Forces |

Every billet expresses its attachments in a postfix string:  
`AMU-23 = {Leader[C], UX-Designer[C], Data-Sci[R], DevOps[E]}`

---

## Ⅳ Scorecard Trident (promotion gate)

| Vector | Instrument | Weight |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Outcome** | Mission-Outcome Index (KRs vs baseline, cost delta) | 50 % |
| **Craft**   | Doctrine Contribution & peer review (AAR citations, playbook merges) | 30 % |
| **Culture** | Crew climate (team NPS, attrition, psychological safety audit) | 20 % |

*Minimum composite ≥ 85/100 to clear gate; < 60 twice = ejection (“up-or-out”).*

---

## Ⅴ Shadow-Board of Young Officers (“Cadet Collegium”)

| Parameter | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| **Eligibility** | Top-decile O-0 / O-1 after ≥ 2 missions |
| **Cadence** | Six-month term, renewable once |
| **Mandate** | • Attend Leadership-Council meetings (no vote)  <br>• Produce quarterly *“Red-Team Memoranda”* challenging core strategy  <br>• Sponsor one experimental AMU per term |
| **Mentorship** | Each cadet paired with an O-4+ sponsor |
| **Graduation Perk** | Fast-track eligibility for O-2 board & equity kicker |

*The tacit contract:* cadets supply dissent, Council supplies tutelage; both ensure generational resilience.

## Ⅶ Cultural & ritual scaffolding

1. **Officer Academy** – eight-week evening program (command theory, finance, negotiation).  
2. **Guild Circles** – specialists curate craft talks; officers must attend quarterly.  
3. **Innovation Games** – quarterly 48-h hackathon; winning pod becomes funded AMU.  
4. **Cull Week** – annual candid feedback; under-performers placed on 90-day remediation.  

---

## Ⅷ Governance safeguards  

| Risk | Guardrail |
|------|-----------|
| Title inflation | Hard caps: officers ≤ 15 % of headcount; council ≤ 9 seats |
| Clique formation | Mandatory oscillation every 18 months; dissolution of static power blocs |
| Burn-out | Sabbatical entitlement after 5 consecutive tours; monitored by People-OCD |
| Stagnant shadow-board | Automatic 100 % turnover each July |

### Concluding synthesis  

You now possess a **single, interlocking schema** where:

* **Assignments** define *where* a human sits and *for how long*;  
* **Tracks & grades** define *what* authority and *how one ascends*;  
* **Scorecards** enforce *meritocratic survival*;  
* **Shadow-board** guarantees a perpetual, dissent-capable feeder line;  
* **Rituals & governance** keep the machine lubricated and entropy-resistant.

Executed rigorously, Eupator becomes **“a company of commanders”**—each tour a crucible, each exit a cull, each promotion a hard-won laurel—ensuring the strategic metabolism never slows and the organisation forever orbits the frontier of competence.
