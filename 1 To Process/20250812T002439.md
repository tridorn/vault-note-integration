Below are a handful of practical avenues you can mix-and-match until you find a rhythm that feels as “liberating” as your current free-form pages—but much faster.

⸻

1. Stop writing sentences—switch to keyword chains + arrows

Think of each thought as a molecule: jot only the atoms that carry meaning.

🡒 meet w/ Alex  → clarify dataset cols  → adjust script  ✓

	•	drop all articles (“the”, “a”), most verbs, and obvious context 
	•	use arrows, bullets, emoji, or dashes to show sequence / causality
	•	reserve the left margin for quick symbols ( ☐ task, ✧ idea, ★ insight, ☄ obstacle, etc. )

With a week of practice you’ll instinctively compress full lines into 4-5 symbols and fragments.

2. Borrow just 10–15 strokes from a full shorthand system

You don’t need to learn 100 wpm court stenography.  A micro-shorthand—only the letters & blends you actually use—gives 80 % of the speed for 20 % of the work.

System	What makes it easy	Typical real-world speed
Teeline	strips vowels, keeps a Latin alphabet feel	80–120 wpm with practice  ￼ ￼
Gregg	fully phonetic curves—flows without lifting pen	100 wpm+ once fluent  ￼ ￼
“Speedwriting”	letters + a few dashes; learn in an afternoon	60 wpm beginner  ￼

How to try it fast
	1.	Grab a Teeline alphabet chart (print or screenshot).
	2.	Pick the 15 most common English words you write (the, and, meeting, idea…), and learn their Teeline outline.
	3.	Every session, force-use those outlines only—ignore the rest of the system.
	4.	Add 2–3 new outlines each weekend.

That tiny kit already lets you write most sentences as squiggles 40-60 % faster.

3. Adopt Rapid Logging from the Bullet Journal method

Rapid Logging is purpose-built for “I need to capture everything but don’t want structure overhead.”
• Bullet  = note
○ Circle  = event
☐ Box   = task (→ migrate | ✕ done)

The symbols act as visual metadata, so you never have to write “(TASK)” or “(DONE)” again.  ￼ ￼

Combine it with shorthand:

☐ wrk out → 30′ sets
○ Fri 14:00   client call
• idea: ↗ AI note-parser?

4. Try sketchnotes for big, conceptual thoughts

A quick icon + one keyword often captures more nuance (and sticks in memory better) than a full sentence.
	•	boxes for main ideas
	•	tiny stick-figures for stakeholders
	•	arrows for flows
	•	speech bubbles for quotes

You don’t need to “draw”—just shapes and arrows.  ￼

5. Gear & ergonomics hack
	•	Fast ink: a smooth gel, roller-ball, or fountain pen with wet ink reduces micro-friction → less hand fatigue, faster strokes.
	•	Angle: keep the page at 30–45° so curves flow naturally (especially for Gregg-style strokes).
	•	Line spacing: use blank or dot-grid paper; freedom to sprawl means less cognitive load fitting words between ruled lines.

⸻

6. Ten-minute daily drill
	1.	Pick a random podcast/news clip (≈120 wpm).
	2.	Try to jot only keywords & symbols in real time.
	3.	Immediately after, expand any gaps in a different color.

You’ll notice the number of “missing pieces” shrinks every day—objective proof you’re speeding up.

⸻

7. When handwriting still isn’t fast enough…
	•	Voice memo + later summary: hit record for raw ideas, then distill to shorthand during your 30-minute review.
	•	Hybrid digital: a re-markable / iPad with a fast stylus lets you lasso-move, tag, and search ink without losing the pen-on-paper feel.

⸻

Quick resource list
	•	“Gregg Shorthand Simplified Manual” (free PDFs online) – skim Chapters 1-3 only.
	•	“Teeline Gold Word List” – 1-page cheat sheet of common outlines.
	•	Official BulletJournal.com FAQ on Rapid Logging – visual examples you can copy today.  ￼

Bottom line:
Stop aiming for sentences. Layer a handful of shorthand strokes on top of Rapid-Logging-style symbols, and you’ll find your pen finally keeps pace with your brain—without giving up the free-flow vibe that works for you.
