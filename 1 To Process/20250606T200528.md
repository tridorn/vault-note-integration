**Clarification:** Your request could have been phrased more precisely as: _"Given an unincorporated business intending to offer digital audit services to German SMEs with future expansion into creative and growth solutions, what is the minimum viable digital infrastructure and operational workflow that enables credibility, execution, and scale?"_

### Strategic Assessment

Your priority is not to build an image but to construct operational legitimacy, executional bandwidth, and revenue momentum with minimal friction. You are selling precision, clarity, and ROI to local SMEs--most of whom are digitally under-optimized and suspicious of fluff. Therefore, your digital and operational setup must reflect **competence over aesthetics**, **execution over narrative**, and **adaptability over scale illusion**.

### Digital Presence: Initial Setup

Your presence must suggest:

- Credibility (not polish)
- Specificity (not breadth)
- Solvency (not potential)

#### 1. **Name + Domain**
- **eupator.de** or **geteupator.de** -- German TLD is critical for local trust.
- Secure alternate versions for brand protection, but don't waste time on global vanity plays.

#### 2. **Landing Page (Single Scroll)**

- Built on **Framer** or **Carrd** (speed, responsiveness, simple hosting)
- Content focuses on:

    - What you do: "Digital Audit für lokale Unternehmen"

    - Who it's for: "Optimierung für kleine und mittlere Betriebe in [Region/Industry]"

    - What they get: ROI-focused, quantifiable outputs

    - CTA: One clear call--**"Kostenloser Schnell-Check anfordern"**

Don't explain your future services. Sell what you do now, clearly.

#### 3. **Email Infrastructure**

- **Google Workspace** or **Zoho Mail** under eupator.de
- Use aliases (audit@, hello@, etc.) sparingly, keep client-facing identity clear and singular.

#### 4. **LinkedIn Page**

- No Instagram, no Twitter. LinkedIn only.
- Focus on posting real insights from audits (anonymized), benchmarking, before/after cases. Build business trust, not follower count.

#### 5. **Local SEO**

- **Google Business Profile**: set up address (virtual or office), opening hours, categories
- Acquire 3--5 initial reviews from friendly SMEs or collaborators

### Core Operational Workflow

**Think "high-margin minimum viable agency."** Do not overbuild. Time, not tech, is the constraint.

#### 1. **Lead Capture**

- Typeform + Notion automation for intake questionnaire
- Route leads via email → Notion CRM board (or Pipedrive if deal volume > 10/month)

#### 2. **Project Execution Stack**

- **Audit Execution**: Google Docs for templated reports

    - Build reusable audit template: Website, SEO, Performance, UX

    - Checklist structure with scoring and recommendations
- **File Management**: Google Drive structured per client
- **Client Delivery**: PDF reports + optional Loom video overview

#### 3. **Communication**

- **Email + Loom + Signal/WhatsApp (if clients insist)**
- No Slack. Don't simulate internal culture prematurely.

#### 4. **Task + Project Tracking**
- **Notion**: Use it for everything--CRM, project tracking, SOPs, content calendar
- Optional: Integrate with Zapier for lead > project board automation

#### 5. **Outsourcing / Fulfillment**

- Recruit per-project via vetted freelancers on Malt, Upwork (EU focus), or direct networks
- Use Notion template-based briefs
- Pay via Wise or Revolut Business

### Core Toolset (Initial Stack)

| Function | Tool | Rationale | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Website | Framer or Carrd | Fast, no dev overhead | 
| Domain + Email | Google Workspace | Professional + scalable | 
| CRM / PM | Notion | Flexible + single brain | 
| Intake | Typeform | Clean, embeddable | 
| Delivery | Google Docs + Loom | Report + async client comms | 
| File Storage | Google Drive | Unified w/ email and Docs | 
| Freelancer Mgmt | Notion + Wise | Structured briefs, fast payout | 
| Communication | Gmail + Loom | Email + async saves time | 
* * *

### Workflow Priorities

1. **Standardize the Audit Offering**

    - One deliverable type

    - Fixed price, 2--3 tiers

    - Templated execution to enable outsourcing

2. **Systematize Lead Handling**

    - Qualify fast or drop

    - Build backlog of leads, not clients

3. **Create 3 Case Studies**

    - Fastest route to building trust

    - Use anonymized before/after examples, emphasize business impact
* * *

### Summary

Your leverage is in asymmetric operational efficiency--minimum team, maximum structure. Build only what increases execution speed or client trust. Everything else is distraction. Expansion into other services should follow demonstrated pull, not assumption. Use this first phase to test pricing elasticity, vertical demand patterns, and client sophistication levels.

Confirm if you'd like a pre-built Notion template or SOP set for any of the workflows.
