# Current Top 10 Virtues

Your query could be more precisely articulated as: "Should the virtue of courage be included in the list, and if so, which of the existing virtues should it replace?"

**Courage** is indeed a fundamental virtue, particularly for facing fears, taking risks, and standing up for one's beliefs. Given its importance, it could be beneficial to include it. Here's a reevaluation of the list with courage in mind:

---

**1. Perseverance:** Continue making effort despite difficulties.  
**2. Integrity:** Adhere consistently to personal ethics.  
**3. Composure:** Maintain calm and focus under pressure.  
**4. Focus:** Concentrate on specific goals.  
**5. Adaptability:** Adjust effectively to new circumstances.  
**6. Drive:** Maintain continuous motivation and energy.  
**7. Confidence:** Believe in your abilities and decisions.  
**8. Determination:** Persistently pursue goals without wavering.  
**9. Courage:** Face fears and take necessary risks.  
**10. Discipline:** Maintain control and order in your actions.

**Replacement Consideration:**
- **Empathy** is a vital virtue, but it might be less immediately actionable for guiding your day-to-day personal progress compared to the other virtues listed. It often applies more to interpersonal relationships rather than self-guidance.
