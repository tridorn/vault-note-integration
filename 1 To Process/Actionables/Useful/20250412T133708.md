# Meta-Clusters

---

## Overview

**Meta-Clusters** are the top-level **logical** structures that all notes in some way or the other link back to. While the folder structure is designed to foster finding and retrieving notes in a natural way (without havoing to use search tools, a caveat as notes are [[20250407T165456#Titling|titled using IDs]]), Meta-Clusters exist to bring form into the entire body of notes.

I built earlier versions of my system based on library categorisation system such as the Universal Decimal Classification system, meta-clusters are entirely based on my own preference and how useful the structure will be for me in practice.

## Thinking Tools

This is your *operating system*, not your content. How you process, not what you process.

- **Note-Taking**  
- **Writing**  
- **Reading**  
- **Thinking**  
- **Memory**  
- **Learning**  
- **Creativity**  
- **Communication**  
- **Problem-Solving**  
- **Decision-Making**

---

## Knowledge Domains

This is where your content goes—concepts, theories, models.  
Each of these can become a dense internal wiki over time.

- **Philosophy**  
- **Psychology**  
- **Sociology**  
- **History**  
- **Politics**  
- **Economics**  
- **Science**

- **Systems**  
- **Language**  
- **Art**  
- **Design**  
- **Culture**

## Humans

The self, the body, the inner world. Your subjectivity is not noise—it’s signal.

- **Mind**  
- **Body**  
- **Emotion**  
- **Purpose**  
- **Identity**  
- **Values**  
- **Habits**  
- **Virtues**  
- **Limits**  
- **Spirituality**  

---

## Social

How humans organize, interact, build, and collapse.

- **Organizations**  
- **Power**  
- **Leadership**  
- **Strategy**  
- **Negotiation**  
- **Institutions**  
- **Narratives**  
- **Conflict**  
- **Cooperation**  
- **Civilization**  

---

## Making & Building

Applied knowledge. Where insight turns into form.

- **Architecture**  
- **Engineering**  
- **Craft**  
- **Product Design**  
- **Software**  
- **Writing (as output)**  
- **Publishing**  
- **Prototyping**  
- **Marketing**  
- **Finance**  
- **Operations**  

---

## Time & Change

This is the temporal axis: cycles, history, transformation.

- **History** (can be repeated if you want it both as domain and temporal lens)  
- **Trends**  
- **Innovation**  
- **Evolution**  
- **Futures**  
- **Past Civilizations**  
- **Cycles**  
- **Timelines**  
- **Entropy**  
- **Progress**

## Language

You've already discovered this one, correctly so—it transcends and intersects all others.

- **Languages** (natural)  
- **Programming Languages**  
- **Grammar**  
- **Syntax**  
- **Rhetoric**  
- **Translation**  
- **Semantics**  
- **Writing Systems**  
- **Typography**  
- **Linguistics**

## Myth & Meaning

For symbolic systems, archetypes, fiction, philosophy with soul.

- **Mythology**  
- **Symbolism**  
- **Fictional Worlds**  
- **Religion**  
- **Ritual**  
- **Metaphor**  
- **Meaning**  
- **Dreams**  
- **Legends**  
- **Cultural Memory**

## Meta-Structures

For the frameworks you’re building, like the Company Architecture Protocol.

- **Frameworks**  
- **Systems**  
- **Models**  
- **Maps**  
- **Scales**  
- **Taxonomies**  
- **Ontologies**  
- **Structures**  
- **Theories**  
- **Protocols**

---

## Caveats

- Don’t implement this as folders. Let them be note-clusters or MOCs (Maps of Content) that *self-organize* over time.
- These are not “right.” They are *provisional lenses*. Replace, merge, split, or delete as reality dictates.
- Avoid hard boundaries. Notes can belong to more than one cluster. Don’t try to force exclusivity.

You are not building a **library**. You are building a **neural web**. Let it pulse, overlap, sprawl—but give it clear points to gravitate around.

## Reference

- [[20250412T133014]] (Drafts): Laid the groundwork for the structure, meta-clusters, and sub-categories. The system rests almost entirely on it.
