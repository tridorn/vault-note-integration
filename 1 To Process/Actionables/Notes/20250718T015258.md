This is why it's important to always follow the IMSAFE checklist before taking control of an aircraft:

Illness, medication, stress, alcohol, fatigue, emotion. 

If you're not a pilot this checklist can still be very useful for anything that carries inherent risks - eg, going on a big drive, operating heavy equipment or going scuba diving etc etc.
