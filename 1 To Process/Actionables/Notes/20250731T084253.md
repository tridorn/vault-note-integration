Serial dater/possible whore here.

Make it FUN!

Literally it's hard coming off the bench to feel comfortable taking swings, but if you already got a hit.... CHILL

girls have options!! (you do too; but 95% of the girls that want you, won't make it obvious enough that your dumbass notices [me too]â€¦ honestly so many girls are so subtle because our weird societal dynamics reward the girls who tell guys what they want with horrible labels, so until people stop being shitty- the ball is generally still in your court).

So when you're on a date, please please please don't "try" to do anything, just fucking enjoy the fact you get to have dinner with a beautiful girl on a Friday.

Moments present THEMSELVES, you can't really plan/chase them

Romance is the naturally formed path between strangers to inseparable between people who walk the same path in life on enough dimensions to feel complimented but still challenged.

Don't read guides online- go out and tell your favorite jokes and be goofy the way you are with the boys- girls love to see that you aren't full of absolute shit

Spit your game

Talk your shit

Either they'll like you or they won't- but keep being YOU.. loud enough that even though 90% of girls won't want to date you that still leaves something like 350-450 million women willing to give you a shot left on the planet that hear your energy and can read it enough to take you up on the offer.

(most likely) Man-Whore OUT
