# Lessons Learned

---

## Introduction

This can be any kind of things derived from personal experience. No discrimination in terms of source, anything can yield good lessons and even be applied removed from the original context.

## General Lessons

- When wanting to address something big never ever do it in a moment of anger, always chose the right moment carefully
- Trust in others to do their task. Supervise and guide them but never incriminate them for doing the wrong thing or overrule their decisions even if you think its wrong. Especially don't act negatively when you think theyre wrong. Create an atmosphere that allows room for failure and don't create a competitive atmosphere of hostility
