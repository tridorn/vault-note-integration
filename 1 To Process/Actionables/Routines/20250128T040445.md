Carrying a physical reminder like a piece of paper with your goal written on it is a simple yet powerful practice. To make the most of these moments "in between doors," when you pull it out to refocus, here's how you can approach it:

* * *

### **1. Pause and Anchor Yourself**

- **Take a Breath**: Before looking at the paper, take a deep breath. This helps you calm any distractions and prepare to focus.
- **Ground Yourself**: Notice where you are--your physical surroundings, the sounds, and sensations--then bring your attention inward to align your mindset with your goal.
* * *

### **2. Read the Goal with Intention**

- **Read Slowly**: Don't rush through the words. Let each word sink in as if you're affirming the goal to yourself.
- **Feel the Emotion**: As you read it, summon the excitement, pride, and confidence you associate with achieving it. Let these feelings inspire and energize you.
* * *

### **3. Visualize Briefly**

- **Imagine Success in That Moment**: Close your eyes for a few seconds (if the setting allows) and picture yourself living that reality:
	 - See yourself confidently acting in the role of a billionaire.
	 - Feel the gratitude and abundance of already having achieved it.
	 - Hear the conversations or applause as people acknowledge your success.
	 - Remember, it doesn't have to be a detailed visualization; a quick, vivid snapshot of your future self is enough.
* * *

### **4. Affirm Your Progress**

- **Internal Dialogue**: Silently affirm:
	 - *"I am progressively realizing my goal."*
	 - *"I am taking the right steps every day."*
- Remind yourself that success is a journey, and by thinking and acting in alignment with your goal, you're always moving closer to it.
* * *

### **5. Set a Micro-Action**

- **Use the Moment to Refocus**: Think of one small, actionable step you can take in the immediate future to align with your goal.
	 - If you're heading to a meeting, how can you embody confidence and leadership?
	 - If you're in transit, use the time to listen to a podcast, read, or reflect on a billionaire trait you want to develop.
* * *

### **6. Reinforce Gratitude**

- **Appreciate Where You Are Now**: As you put the paper away, take a moment to feel grateful for the progress you've already made, the lessons you've learned, and the opportunities you have ahead.
- This reinforces a positive mindset and keeps you motivated.
* * *

### Example Routine: 60-Second Practice

1. Pull out the paper and take a deep breath.
2. Read your goal slowly, savoring each word.
3. Picture one scene of yourself as a billionaire.
4. Say to yourself, *"I am on my way. Every action brings me closer."*
5. Put the paper away with a renewed sense of focus and purpose.

* * *

By consistently engaging with your goal in this way, even for just a minute, you're training your mind to see it as a reality. Over time, these moments of focus accumulate, reinforcing the mindset and actions needed to achieve it.
