# Morning Routine

---

## Overview

---

## 03:00 To 03:30

This marks the first part of the morning routine. Here, I do things related to the necessary upkeep of the body and initial preparation for the day.

1. Turn alarms off
2. Sit on bed and invoke intention for the day
3. Drink 500ml of water
4. Visit the toilet
5. Shave
6. Eat morning meal
7. Brush teeth
8. Do stretching
9. Get dressed
10. Do Headspace meditation (in chair with window angled)

This routine is ambitious (as it requires at least 10 if not more minutes for the Headspace meditation and a cut-off at 03:25) and can only work if there has been work done in preparation the day before.
