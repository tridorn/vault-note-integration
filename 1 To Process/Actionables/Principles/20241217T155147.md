Thoughts/thinking on demand

– The more you think about aspects (like projects or tasks) not in your control (yet), the more it is going to drain your mental energy and reduce your ability to make the right choices
– Thinking on demand means not random associations but associations related to the topic at hand -> train associations
– or through inspiration
