# Don't Write Down Notes Until You Have a Picture of the Concept in Your Mind

--- 

## Elaboration

Anywhere, let it be reading a book, listening to a lecture, to a podcast. Don't take notes ([[2024-03-15-16-10-27|in your own words]]) until you have grasped some of the concept in your mind. The point isn't to write down words that are spoken to not see them flying away, the true purpose is to capture the underlying idea and then write it down.
