# Internal Good Feelings

## Exposition

When [memories that aren't yours] arise, don't block but embrace them. Every feeling can be traced back to your body rewarding or punishing you, from what action this reward/punishment derives from doesn't matter, the result is the same. Thus every positive feeling solely created by your mind is worth pursuing as it doesn't cost anything but yields results. This indulgence must be restricted to feelings created only based on your mind. Something like a craving for sweets must not be followed.

Part of how to live a happy life with optimal time allocation. Continuous reward, or rather, when it arises, instead of waiting for the end of the day, the end of the week, for holidays. These feelings cannot be created on the spot but arise at random times, this is why they are always worth embracing
