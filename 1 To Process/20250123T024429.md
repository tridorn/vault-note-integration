You might have phrased your request in this way: "As I pondered the increasing challenge of memorializing the deceased in a world where inflation has rendered traditional forms of remembrance inaccessible, I reflected on the possible ways to reform the practice of remembering. Could you offer insights on creating a modern, adaptable service that facilitates remembrance through both digital and physical means?"

Firstly, you touch upon an essential issue: the rising costs of traditional burials and memorialization, juxtaposed with the enduring human need to remember and honor the dead. The concept you've conceived, blending digital and physical remembrance, aligns well with the shifting cultural and economic landscape, especially in a country like Germany, where the demographic is aging, and the demand for sustainable, affordable solutions is increasing.

Here are a few considerations and refinements for your idea:

1. **Digital Memorialization**: While the notion of "portfolios of remembrance" is strong, it must extend beyond mere digital 3D images or photo albums. You could design interactive experiences where people can contribute memories, writings, or even voice recordings. Augmented reality (AR) might offer immersive ways to bring a deceased relative "back" in specific physical contexts, like a home or favorite park, making remembrance more tangible. 

2. **Tiered Services and Flexibility**: The concept of offering varying service levels—ranging from basic to luxurious—is astute. Consider also integrating personalized packages that allow families to choose a la carte services, from grief counseling to managing digital legacies (handling social media accounts, for instance). This kind of flexibility appeals to different financial strata while making the service accessible to many.

3. **Local Alternatives**: The idea of smaller, more affordable garden tombstones or personalized markers is pragmatic and can indeed cater to those who seek to keep memorialization intimate. You could design modular, eco-friendly alternatives to conventional tombstones, including biodegradable markers or those embedded with NFC chips to access digital content about the deceased when scanned.

4. **Sustainability Focus**: There’s an increasing interest in eco-burials and "green" alternatives. These could range from tree burials, natural burials, or even transforming ashes into stones or jewelry. Positioning your idea as a sustainable alternative would likely appeal to younger generations, who might care deeply about environmental impact.

5. **Remembrance as a Process**: Expanding beyond the "moment" of death, you might focus on integrating longer-term grief management. You mentioned grief counseling, which is important, but think also of providing digital prompts to the living: reminders on significant dates, anniversaries, birthdays, etc. This would transform the service from merely reactive to an ongoing process of remembrance.

6. **Technological Integration**: Since you're thinking about portfolios, integrating AI-driven sentiment analysis could be intriguing—something that analyzes how the living speak of the deceased over time, crafting an evolving narrative of remembrance. It’s cutting-edge, but could offer emotional support by showing the deceased as remembered, not just fixed in time.

7. **Partnerships with Existing Institutions**: While your idea could challenge traditional graveyards, a more strategic approach might involve partnering with these institutions. Offering digital supplements to traditional gravesites (like virtual plaques) could allow graveyards to modernize and provide value-added services, without compromising the solemnity of their function.

Lastly, regarding **scalability** and **profitability**, if you’re thinking about setting up this kind of business, it’s crucial to consider the legal aspects, especially concerning data security and privacy, which are of utmost importance in Germany and the EU. You’ll need robust GDPR-compliant systems, particularly if storing sensitive personal memories online.
