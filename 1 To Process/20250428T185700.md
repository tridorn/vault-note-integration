Below is the **minimum-viable “company dossier”**—the set of concrete artifacts you should assemble over the next 4-6 weeks to turn a slide-deck idea into an investable, execution-ready venture.  Sequence them roughly in the order shown; each later piece relies on the prior one.

| # | Artifact | Purpose | 5-second Litmus Test |
|---|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **A1** | **Problem & Customer Evidence Memo** (≤ 5 pp) | Summarise real interviews with ≥ 10 target SMEs, 3 vendors, 2 credit heads.  Capture exact quotes, pains, and willingness-to-pay. | Can a new hire understand *who* hurts, *why*, and *what they pay today* without speaking to you? |
| **A2** | **Regulatory Requirements Matrix** (spreadsheet) | Row = rule/obligation (EU Taxonomy, EBA ESG file, SME-Sustainable-Finance draft, KfW-295 forms). Column = “Data field”, “Who supplies”, “When captured”, “Audit trail”. | If a banker points at any rule, you can show where that data will live.  |
| **A3** | **Guarantee Playbook** (one-pager per scheme) | Cheat-sheet of eligibility, coverage %, fee, process time for KfW, Bürgschaftsbank, InvestEU.  Include contact names. | A junior can stack the best guarantee in < 15 min.  |
| **A4** | **End-to-End User Journey Storyboard** (10–12 slides or one A3 poster) | Visually map SME → Vendor → Platform → Bank → Post-funding telemetry.  Annotate data hand-offs. | Any outsider “gets” the flow in 90 seconds. |
| **A5** | **Functional Product Spec v0.1** (Notion doc) | Field-by-field description of the five platform layers you and I defined (ingestion, project builder, guarantee engine, risk-file compiler, telemetry loop).  Mark *v1* vs *later*. | Engineers can start backlog grooming without another meeting. |
| **A6** | **Technical Architecture Diagram** | Boxes & arrows: APIs used (open-banking, IoT), data lake, rules engine, PDF/JSON exporter, bank API.  Include security boundary and GDPR controls. | Your future CTO can explain it on a whiteboard in < 3 min. |
| **A7** | **Data-Protection & InfoSec Outline** (2 pp) | Identify personal data, retention policy, encryption at rest/in transit, DPO contact.  Align to GDPR & BaFin cloud circular. | Passes a seed-round diligence checklist without rewrite. |
| **A8** | **Initial Credit & Performance Model** (Excel) | Very simple: input default rate, guarantee coverage, interest spread, sensor-verified savings.  Outputs IRR for bank & SME. | Shows bank partner that unit economics beat their hurdle. |
| **A9** | **12-Quarter Financial Model** (Excel) | Revenue lines: origination fee, subscription, data resale.  Cost lines: headcount, cloud, onboarding incentives.  Scenario tab (base/-30 % volume). | Investor can test dilution & cash runway assumptions in minutes. |
| **A10** | **Vendor Partnership Term Sheet Template** (3 pp) | Scope of exclusivity, data-feed requirement, payment timing, performance claw-back. | First installer can sign with minimal legal edits. |
| **A11** | **Bank Pilot Proposal Deck** (6–8 slides) | Pain → solution → guarantee economics → compliance fit → pilot KPIs → timeline. | Credit-head can walk into ExCo and ask for sandbox approval. |
| **A12** | **Seed Data-Room Index** (one index.md) | Lists every artifact above + cap-table, founders’ CVs.  Hyperlinks to G-Drive/Notion. | New investor never emails “do you have…?” |

### Execution Cadence

| Week | Deliverables Finished | Gate Passed |
|------|----------------------|-------------|
| 0 | A1 | Real customer pain validated |
| 1 | A2, A3 | Regulatory & guarantee feasibility clear |
| 2 | A4, A5 | Flow locked, engineers can estimate |
| 3 | A6, A7 | Tech & compliance risk de-risked |
| 4 | A8, A9 | Unit economics provable |
| 5 | A10, A11 | Ready to solicit first vendor + bank pilots |
| 6 | A12 | Seed data room live—fund-raising ready |

### Practical Tips

* **Start with A2 + A3 in the same spreadsheet**—they anchor every later decision.  
* Use **loom screencasts** to walk investors through A4; pictures > docs.  
* Keep every artifact in **version-controlled cloud folders**; revision history is your friend when regulators ask.  
* Review artifacts fortnightly; treat them as code: alive, not static.

Nail these twelve, and you transform a slide deck into a fundable, partner-ready company skeleton.  Everything else—UI polish, branding, hiring deck—can follow once this backbone is in place.
