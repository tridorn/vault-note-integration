Reading your own shorthand after you’ve written it—especially days, weeks, or months later—depends heavily on three factors:

⸻

🧠 1. Your fluency level
	•	Beginner (<1 month in):
You’ll struggle even to read yesterday’s page. You haven’t internalized enough of the system to decode it automatically.
	•	Intermediate (1–3 months):
You can read most of your own notes within a few days of writing, but older entries may take effort or feel like solving a puzzle.
	•	Fluent (3–6+ months, daily use):
You can read most of your shorthand almost as easily as longhand—even months later. You’ll have a muscle memory for common words, phrases, and even the way you stylize things.

✍️ 2. Which system you use

System	Readability after time	Notes
Teeline	★★★★☆	Keeps alphabet base → easier to decipher after long breaks
Gregg Simplified	★★★☆	Fluid and fast, but more abstract; memory is key
Pitman	★★☆☆	Requires knowledge of thickness + position; not ideal without practice
Plover / stenotype	★★★★★	Output is typed text = instantly readable

Gregg is readable long-term if you keep using it. But if you stop for 3+ months, you’ll likely lose decoding ability unless you:
	•	Reread old notes regularly
	•	Create a glossary of personal abbreviations or “brief forms”
	•	Use margin labels, summaries, or color codes for key points

⸻

🧾 3. How consistently you write
	•	Do you form your outlines the same way every time?
	•	Are you using correct shorthand, or inventing ad hoc scribbles?
	•	Do you have a few “sloppy” forms that look like five different words?

The more consistent your shorthand execution, the easier it is to read.

✦ Tip: Include full-word “anchors” periodically. For example, write full “idea” or “goal” next to its shorthand early on—just to help later decoding.

🧪 Realistic scenario

You write:

✦ → mtg: J + D
chk rpt / fig → sales↘ q2
bgt adj?
✧ next: ↗demo + ⊕mkting

Two hours later → easy
Tomorrow → still clear
3 months later → if you’re fluent, fine. If not, “⊕mkting” might throw you

🧠 Think of it like…

Learning shorthand is like learning to write and read your own dialect. You’ll understand it best while your mental context is still fresh. If you want reliability later:

Use shorthand for the fast draft → then summarize in full English below, or in a weekly “key insights” recap.

Verdict: How hard is it, really?

Time after writing	Reading difficulty (if fluent)	Notes
Minutes–hours	🟢 Easy	Feels natural
Next day	🟢 Still easy	Muscle memory still active
1–2 weeks later	🟡 Some effort	Especially with less-used symbols
1–3 months later	🟡–🔴 Depends on fluency	Readable if practiced; cryptic if not
6+ months later	🔴 Only with reinforcement	Risk of forgetting rarely used outlines
