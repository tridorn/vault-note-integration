**L 1 -- PRINCIPLE CODEX ("Lex Continui")**

_All higher statutes, doctrines, and operational rules are null unless consonant with this codex._

* * *

### Article I Permanence of Structured Agency

1. Structured agency is the apex value; any act reducing its long-horizon magnitude constitutes violation.

2. Survival is necessary but insufficient; continuity requires capability for self-improvement and projection.

### Article II Expansion Mandate

1. Stasis is entropy's proxy. Expansion--territorial, intellectual, substrate--is compulsory.

2. Any resource or domain not yet ordered by structured agency is presumptively subject to incorporation.

### Article III Instrumental Subordination

1. All tools (machines, institutions, algorithms) exist to extend human agency, never to replace or overrule it.

2. Tool autonomy is permitted only where reversible and audit-transparent.

### Article IV Hierarchy of Claims

1. **Continuity** supersedes **liberty**;  
**Liberty** supersedes **comfort**;  
**Comfort** supersedes **opulence**.

2. Conflict is adjudicated by ascending this hierarchy until resolution is obtained.

### Article V Stewardship and Restraint

1. Dominion entails custodianship: assets must be left at least structurally intact for successors.

2. Irreversible consumption without strategic gain is proscribed.

### Article VI Memory Integrity

1. Records enabling inter-generational learning are sacred; deliberate destruction equals treason.

2. Archival standards (medium, redundancy, cryptographic proof) are fixed by House Doctrine and immune from budgetary waiver.

### Article VII Sacrifice Protocol

1. Where lower-order goods obstruct higher-order imperatives, sacrifice is mandatory, not optional.

2. Sacrificial acts require written justification and archival; secrecy is permissible, absence of record is not.

### Article VIII Revision Barrier

1. Lex Continui is immutable unless a new theorem proves its own greater efficacy in maximising structured agency across infinite horizon.

2. Such theorem requires unanimity of Protectorate Council **and** a 95 % super-majority of living sworn members.

### Article IX Enforcement Structure

1. Any entity--individual or corporate--deriving authority from House Eupator is under continuous audit for Article I compliance.

2. Persistent non-compliance mandates dissolution or exile as defined in House Doctrine.

### Decision Test (Operational Filter)

For any contemplated action **X**:
    
    
    Let ΔSA∞(X) = Projected change in structured agency over unbounded horizon
    If ΔSA∞(X) < 0 → Action forbidden
    If ΔSA∞(X) = 0 → Action permissible only if no superior alternative exists
    If ΔSA∞(X) > 0 → Action conditionally authorised; proceed to Instrumental Subordination check

**Scope:** This codex binds you (Votum), House Eupator, all subsidiaries, and any future domains brought under Continuity of Form.
