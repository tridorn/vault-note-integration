Measuring **individual success** within the broader **company structure**, beyond the scope of **AMUs**, requires a more holistic and **long-term approach** that ties into **strategic objectives**, **personal development**, and **overall company culture**. The challenge is to ensure that individual performance is not just assessed by **short-term achievements** or **project-based work** (like in AMUs) but also considers **continuous contribution**, **leadership growth**, and **alignment with the company’s mission** and **values**.

Here's a framework to evaluate individual success across the broader company structure:

---

### **1. Role-Specific Objectives and Key Results (RSOKRs)**

In the broader company context, every individual should have **Role-Specific OKRs (RSOKRs)** that align with the company’s **overall strategy** and **functional needs**. These RSOKRs should be reviewed on a **quarterly or annual basis** to ensure long-term success and continuous alignment.

#### **A. Tying RSOKRs to Company Objectives**

- **Individual Objectives**: These should reflect **ongoing responsibilities** outside of AMU-based work, such as day-to-day tasks, leadership responsibilities, or operational roles.
- **Key Results**: These Key Results can reflect **quantifiable achievements**, like increasing sales by a specific percentage, improving process efficiency, or expanding market reach.
  
- **Example**:
  - A **sales manager** might have RSOKRs like:
	 - Increase revenue from **existing clients** by 20% within Q4.
	 - **Onboard and mentor** two new sales team members by the end of the year.
  
- **Focus**: RSOKRs ensure that individuals contribute meaningfully to the company’s **long-term vision** while managing ongoing responsibilities. These metrics should also evolve as the company grows, ensuring **alignment** between individual progress and strategic direction.

#### **B. Cross-Departmental Impact**

- For **senior roles**, success should be measured by their **impact across departments** or the wider organization. For instance, how a **department head** facilitates **collaboration**, aligns the department’s goals with the company’s vision, or mentors others in leadership.

---

### **2. Personal Development and Leadership Growth**

Beyond project outcomes or Key Results, **individual growth and leadership development** are critical for long-term success within the company. This goes beyond metrics and involves tracking personal milestones in **skills development**, **mentorship**, and **decision-making responsibilities**.

#### **A. Leadership Development Framework**

- **Leadership Potential**: Assess employees on their ability to **take initiative**, **make strategic decisions**, and **mentor or influence others**. Success here isn’t about task completion but how individuals evolve into **leaders** within the company.
- **Promotion Readiness**: Track individual readiness for **higher responsibility** or **leadership positions** by assessing their **soft skills**, ability to navigate **complex challenges**, and **collaborative spirit**.

#### **B. Skills Development Tracking**

- Create a **skills development framework** that tracks individual growth over time. This could include:
  - **Training programs** or **certifications** completed.
  - **New skills** learned (e.g., technical skills, leadership training).
  - **Mentorship experience** (both as a mentor and mentee).
  
- Regularly evaluate whether individuals are expanding their skillsets in line with company needs and future roles.

#### **C. Personal Growth Reviews**

- **Annual Development Reviews**: Hold formal reviews that focus on an employee’s **personal growth trajectory**, not just performance. Discuss:
  - How the individual has grown over the past year.
  - New skills learned and how they were applied.
  - Areas where they could develop further, both professionally and personally.

### **3. Cultural and Values Alignment**

Evaluating how well an employee embodies the company’s **core values** is critical, especially in a company structure that emphasizes **cultural cohesion**. This goes beyond performance and focuses on **how** an individual approaches their work and **interacts with others**.

#### **A. Cultural Values as Performance Metrics**

- Align **cultural values** with individual performance assessments by embedding them into the evaluation process. For example:
  - **Innovation**: Does the employee demonstrate **creative thinking** and **problem-solving**? Have they initiated new ideas that contributed to the company’s success?
  - **Collaboration**: How well does the individual work across teams? Do they **support colleagues**, and are they receptive to feedback?
  - **Ownership**: Does the employee take responsibility for their work and the outcome, even in challenging situations?

#### **B. Peer and Team Feedback on Cultural Fit**

- Incorporate **peer reviews** and **team feedback** on how well individuals embody the company’s values. Employees could provide feedback on how well their colleagues demonstrate **collaborative spirit**, **problem-solving**, and **leadership potential**. This feedback can be integrated into broader performance evaluations.

#### **C. Recognition for Value-Driven Behavior**

- Establish recognition systems that highlight **value-driven behavior**. Individuals who consistently reflect the company’s core values in their work—whether through **collaboration, leadership, or innovation**—can be recognized through **awards, promotions**, or even **public acknowledgment** during company events.

### **4. Long-Term Contributions and Impact**

While **RSOKRs** and **performance metrics** reflect shortto medium-term success, it’s important to evaluate an individual’s **long-term contributions** to the company. This focuses on an employee's **sustained impact** over time, not just during a single project or quarter.

#### **A. Track Impact Over Time**

- Track the **cumulative contributions** an individual has made to the company, such as:
  - **Major initiatives** they’ve led or contributed to.
  - **Innovations** or **process improvements** they’ve introduced.
  - **Long-term relationships** they’ve developed (with clients, partners, or other departments).
  
- Ensure that these contributions are factored into **promotion decisions**, **raises**, and **long-term career growth**.

#### **B. Cumulative 360-Degree Feedback**

- Use **360-degree feedback** over time to assess how an employee’s impact is perceived across multiple stakeholders—leadership, peers, clients, and team members. If an individual consistently receives positive feedback across various projects or roles, this demonstrates a **long-term alignment** with the company’s vision.

#### **C. Legacy and Knowledge Transfer**

- Evaluate how well individuals contribute to the **long-term success** of the company through **knowledge transfer**. This might involve:
  - **Mentorship**: Individuals who consistently mentor younger employees, ensuring the **transfer of knowledge and company culture**.
  - **Documentation and Legacy Projects**: Employees who help develop **guidelines, training materials**, or contribute to **organizational memory**.

---

### **5. Behavioral and Soft Skills Metrics**

In addition to hard performance metrics, individual success should be assessed through **behavioral and soft skills** that contribute to team dynamics and overall organizational health.

#### **A. Emotional Intelligence and Interpersonal Skills**

- Measure an individual’s ability to:
  - **Communicate effectively**: How well do they articulate their ideas and collaborate with others?
  - **Adapt to changing circumstances**: Do they show resilience and flexibility under pressure?
  - **Empathy and leadership**: Are they attuned to the needs of others and able to lead with empathy?
  
- Use **360-degree feedback** and **leadership reviews** to assess these qualities and offer **developmental feedback** where needed.

#### **B. Conflict Resolution and Problem-Solving**

- Evaluate how well an individual handles **conflict** or **challenging situations**. Employees who demonstrate **effective conflict resolution skills** and an ability to navigate **difficult problems** are invaluable to maintaining a healthy work environment.

#### **C. Collaboration and Influence**

- Track how employees contribute to **cross-functional teams** or **cross-departmental projects**. Success here is not just about completing tasks but about **facilitating collaboration**, **influencing others positively**, and working towards **common goals**.

---

### **6. Continuous Learning and Self-Improvement**

For success within a company structure, individuals should be evaluated on their **commitment to learning** and **continuous self-improvement**.

#### **A. Commitment to Growth**

- Track each employee’s **investment in their own development** through training, certifications, and skill-building. This could include participation in:
  - **Internal training programs**.
  - **External certifications** aligned with their role.
  - **Workshops, conferences**, or **leadership development programs**.

#### **B. Learning and Adaptability**

- Evaluate how well employees **apply new knowledge** or adapt to new processes and technologies. Employees who are **open to learning** and **willing to evolve** with the company are crucial for long-term success.

#### **C. Mentorship and Teaching Others**

- Success in a company structure should also be measured by how well individuals **teach and mentor others**. Employees who help bring up **junior team members** or contribute to a **culture of learning** are invaluable to long-term growth.

### **Conclusion: A Balanced Approach for Individual Success**

Evaluating individual success within the broader company structure goes beyond **project-specific outcomes** (as in AMUs) and requires a focus on **long-term contributions, personal development, cultural alignment**, and **behavioral skills**. By combining **Role-Specific OKRs (RSOKRs)**, **peer feedback**, and a focus on **leadership potential**, **personal growth**, and **long-term impact**, you create a comprehensive and integrated approach that recognizes both **tangible achievements** and **softer contributions** to the company’s mission, vision, and culture.
