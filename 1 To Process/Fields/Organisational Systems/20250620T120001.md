A clearer formulation: _"Provide a step-by-step, doctrine-aligned method for scoping execution structures (Missions, Projects, Programs, Campaigns), usable even in complex, evolving scenarios where the full problem space isn't yet visible."_

The nuclear weapon analogy is apt--not for its content, but for its structural clarity. You're dealing with **ambition under uncertainty** with **multi-phase execution**, **tight secrecy**, and **non-negotiable outcomes**.

Here is a precise, rational scoping framework.

* * *

## I. Starting Principle

> **You don't need to know the entire picture. You need to see where ambiguity exceeds available attention.**  
You build structure where attention fails and coordination costs spike--not where a Gantt chart looks neat.

* * *

## II. 5-Step Scoping Method

This can be run solo or as a council session. Takes 30--90 min.

* * *

### **Step 1 -- Surface the Strategic Mandate**

Write down _exactly one_ sentence in the following format:

> "We must make [X] true by [T], such that [Y] becomes achievable or unavoidable."

This gives you the **Campaign-level lens**. If you can't state this, **you're not scoping**, you're still ideating.

**Example**:

> "We must achieve self-sufficiency in weapons-grade uranium refinement by Q4 2028, such that regional deterrence becomes credible and irreversible."

* * *

### **Step 2 -- Decompose Strategic Prerequisites (Program-Level)**

Ask:

> "What must be true, in parallel or in sequence, for the mandate to be realisable?"

Force 3--5 answers only. Each becomes a candidate **Program**.

**Example**:

- PRG_UraniumProcurement
- PRG_RefinementTechnology
- PRG_DeliveryMechanism
- PRG_CounterIntelligence
- PRG_CrisisSimulation

Each Program is still abstract. The point is to frame _the terrain_, not specify all the work.

* * *

### **Step 3 -- Articulate Key Artefacts or Deliverables (Project-Level)**

For each Program, ask:

> "What artefacts must physically or digitally exist for this Program to be complete?"

List ~2--5 per Program. Each becomes a **Project**.

**Example for PRG_RefinementTechnology**:

- PRJ_CentrifugeDesign
- PRJ_TestFacilitySetup
- PRJ_TritiumHandlingUnit

> Projects produce. Programs orchestrate. Campaigns justify.

* * *

### **Step 4 -- Identify Scope Breakpoints (Mission-Level)**

Within each Project, ask:

> "Where would one Commander with a clear team, objective, and 6--12 weeks of effort be sufficient to move the system forward?"

Each answer is a **Mission**.

Use these indicators:

- The work could be _unblocked_ by a team with no dependencies
- The result would clearly either exist or not exist at the end
- Failure would teach something _bounded_, not global

**Example for PRJ_CentrifugeDesign**:

- M001-ModelingRotorDynamics
- M002-PrototypeMagneticControl
- M003-ValidationAgainstVibrationTestData

Each one is independently Commandable, sprintable, and failure-tolerant.

* * *

### **Step 5 -- Flag Tactical Decomposition (Cell-Level)**

For any Mission, ask:

> "Where would 2--4 people working synchronously benefit from having discipline-local focus and tight iteration?"

These are **Cells**. Not structural. No naming, no repo.  
Used to **increase local momentum**, not to structure accountability.

**Example**: M002-PrototypeMagneticControl may form:

- Cell_Electromagnetics
- Cell_AssemblyJigDesign

These never persist beyond the Mission.

* * *

## III. Structural Output

| Layer | Output | Quantity | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Campaign | 1 sentence (strategic intent) | 1 | 
| Program | 3--5 strategy-prerequisites | 3--5 | 
| Project | 2--5 artefact deliverables | 10--20 total | 
| Mission | Sprint-sized execution scopes | 20--50 | 
| Cell | Tactical decomposition inside Missions | as needed | 

All scoped outcomes fit inside 1--2 pages.  
Anything longer is **delaying execution under the guise of planning**.

* * *

## IV. Key Heuristics

### 1. **Do not wait for full visibility.**

Structure exists to uncover visibility through action, not to wait for it.

### 2. **Start with the most time-critical or ambiguity-dense Program.**

Scoping is iterative. You don't need a full map to take the next 3 steps.

### 3. **Never assign structure where high trust + low complexity suffice.**

Structure should only exist to absorb coordination cost and systemic risk.

### 4. **Structure is revealed through friction.**

If a Mission fails to advance, that's a sign of either under-scoping (too big) or false autonomy (needs dependency resolution).

## V. Optional: "Scoping Stack" Template (reusable for any Campaign)
    
    
    # Campaign: [MANDATE]
    
    ## Programs:
    - PRG_Alpha -- [description]
    - PRG_Beta -- [description]
    
    ## Projects inside PRG_Alpha:
    - PRJ_1 -- [artefact]
    - PRJ_2 -- [artefact]
    
    ## Missions inside PRJ_1:
    - M001 -- [objective]
    - M002 -- [objective]
    
    ## (Optional) Cells inside M001:
    - Cell_UI
    - Cell_Modeling

## Bottom Line

- You don't need the whole picture. You need a small clear surface and a doctrine to push into the fog.
- Scoping is the act of _converting complexity into commandable action._
- The company doesn't scale by knowing more--it scales by giving **structure to not-knowing.**
