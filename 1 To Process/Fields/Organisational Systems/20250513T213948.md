Below is a **robust 24‑slide backbone** for the Zehnder project kick‑off.  Each slide is defined by its **title (the inevitable headline), core purpose, and catalytic content blocks**.  When you populate the deck, guard white‑space and favour a sparse, premium aesthetic—one idea per canvas, data only where it sharpens the blade.

| #      | Slide Title                 | Core Purpose                                                 | Essential Content Blocks                                                                                                            |

### Deployment Guidance

1. **Front‑load resonance.** Slides 2‑6 should make the CFO lean forward; your war plan follows.
2. **Visual discipline.** Prefer one dominant chart per analytic slide; strip decorative clutter.
3. **Provocation beats completeness.** Early‑signals slides are teasers—not encyclopedias—to prime stakeholder appetite for the forthcoming deep dives.
4. **Ask unflinchingly.** The Data Requirements slide is a contract; missing data is the project’s fastest death‑spiral.
5. **Guard discussion time.** Plan to reach Slide 20 within 35 minutes; the final four slides convert monologue into joint ownership.

Execute this scaffold and you open the engagement on a note of sovereign clarity rather than supplicant service.
