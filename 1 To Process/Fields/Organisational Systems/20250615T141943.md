**Misstatement rectified:** You should have demanded a _"comprehensive, first-principles re-architecture that fuses cadence, command, support, and intelligence into a single, internally consistent operating system."_  
Below is that system--synthetic, minimal, and scale-proof.

* * *

## 1. Constitutional Premises

1. _Unity of Command, Separation of Concerns_ -- one locus issues strategic intent; execution remains atomised.

2. _Clock Governance_ -- timeboxes are inviolable; all work is trace-stamped.

3. _Contractual Interfaces_ -- every layer is bound by service charters; no informal dependencies.

4. _Feedback Before Control_ -- intelligence loops close faster than decision loops.
* * *

## 2. Structural Spine

| Tier | Mandate | Size | Authority Token | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Sovereign Board** | Ratify doctrine, allocate capital, appoint Portfolio Custodians | 5--7 | Charter | 
| **Portfolio Custodian** | Own a Strategy Portfolio (12-36 m) | 1 per portfolio | Annual Capital Warrant | 
| **Campaign Bureau** | Design Campaigns (9-12 m) that realise portfolio KPIs | ≤3 Custodian deputies | Campaign Writ | 
| **Program Staff** | Slice a Campaign into Programs (6 m) and assign **Project Warrants** | ≤5 | Program Order | 
| **Mission Command** | Execute a Project via Missions (6--12 w) | 1 Mission Commander + 2--4 Cells | Mission Order | 
| **Cell** | Deliver sprint-bound increments (10 d) | 3--5 | Sprint Backlog | 

_Observation:_ "Project" is now a budgeting shell; "Mission" is the kinetic unit.

* * *

## 3. Support & Intelligence Mesh

| Node | Contract | Cadence | Primacy Rule | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Support Guilds** (HR, Legal, Finance, IT) | SLA: response ≤ 48 h; cost-per-unit visible | Monthly guild retro | Cannot overrule Mission priority, only flag risk | 
| **Intelligence Bureau** | Intel Dossier to Program Staff; red-team assumptions | Weekly SITREP | May escalate directly to Custodian if threat > T-3 | 
| **Logistics Core** | Capacity and supply horizon ≥ 8 w | Bi-weekly | Pre-empts Support Guild scheduling | 
* * *

## 4. Temporal Cadence Grid

| Cadence | Owner | Governance Ritual | Output | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Pulse (1 d)** | Cell Lead | Stand-up / wrap | Sprint Log entry | 
| **Sprint (10 d)** | Cell Lead | Review + Retro | Increment + Metrics | 
| **Mission (6--12 w)** | Mission Cmdr. | Mid-Mission audit | Mission Report | 
| **Program (6 m)** | Program Staff | Program Board | Go/kill/scale decision | 
| **Campaign (9-12 m)** | Campaign Bureau | Quarterly War-Room | Portfolio KPI delta | 
| **Season (FY)** | Custodian | Annual Strategic Reset | Capital re-allocation | 

_Governance principle:_ A unit reviews the next lower cadence and reports to the next higher authority.

* * *

## 5. Field Operations Layer

- **Field Officer (FO)** is an _overlay role_--one FO per Mission, drawn from Program Staff.
- FO holds **process immunity**: can requisition Support Guild capacity up to a fixed credit.
- FO files a _Morale & Friction Index_ each Pulse; aggregated by Intelligence Bureau.
* * *

## 6. Doctrine Lifecycle

1. Drafted by **Campaign Bureau**.

2. Stress-tested by **Intelligence Bureau** (red team).

3. Ratified by **Sovereign Board**.

4. Version-controlled; superseded doctrine auto-expires after two Seasons unless reaffirmed.

* * *

## 7. Information Flow (push > pull)
    
    
    Cell  → Mission Cmdr.  → Program Staff  → Bureau  → Custodian  → Board
     ↑                     IH              SD                      ↓
     └────── Mission FO ────┘
    

- **IH** injects threat intel upward every Pulse if Severity ≥ T-3.
- **SD** pushes service metrics weekly; no passive dashboards.
* * *

## 8. Accountability Matrix

| Metric | Measured At | Consequence | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Velocity, Defect Rate | Cell | Sprint retro action items | 
| Mission Target Attainment | Mission | Bonus pool release | 
| Budget Variance | Project | Adjustment at Program gate | 
| Strategic KPI Delta | Campaign | Custodian's capital warrant renewal | 

* * *

## 9. Implementation Phasing

1. **Week 0--2 -- Skeleton**  
• Publish charters, cadence calendar, artefact templates.

2. **Week 3--8 -- Dual Pilot**  
• One software, one consulting Mission; measure SLA adherence.

3. **Month 3 -- Doctrine Freeze**  
• Lock v1; broadcast non-negotiables.

4. **Month 6 -- Scale Gate**  
• Expand to all new Projects; legacy structures sunset inside next Season.

* * *

### Final Calculus

The rebuilt architecture enforces **singular strategy, distributed thrust, audited support, and accelerated feedback**. Every actor knows _when_ to act, _what_ token authorises action, and _which_ charter constrains it. Entropy is cordoned; velocity is institutionalised.
