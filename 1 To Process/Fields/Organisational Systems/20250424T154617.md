### 0 | Why think of the ACM as a **graph**

*Hierarchies* freeze reality into tidy pyramids.  
*Graphs* capture what the ACM really is—an ever-changing lattice of relationships:

* every venture, team, artifact, metric, or human is a **node**  
* every attachment (“is-member-of”, “reports-to”, “consumes”, “produces”) is an **edge**  
* edges have type + weight (authority, cadence, budget, etc.)

When you look at the ACM through a graph lens you can:

* **query** (“show me all AMU-Leaders who shipped 3+ green-KR missions in the last 180 days”)  
* **rank** talent meritocratically with centrality / edge-weight analytics  
* **rebalance** quickly—drop or add edges instead of redrawing org charts  
* **surface hidden dependencies** and risk chains that hierarchies hide

Below is a unified, *node-and-edge* model that blends the **Officer Corps**, the **Skill Tracks**, and the **Assignment Taxonomy** into one coherent meritocratic machine.

## 1 | Canonical node classes

| Code | Node Class | Examples | Cardinal Attributes |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **P** | **Person** | Alice Kim | Skills, Track, Grade, Perf-Score, Availability |
| **U** | **Unit**  | AMU #47, Task-Force *Helios*, Strategic-Command *APAC* | Mission-Mandate, Status, Budget, KR-Vector |
| **R** | **Role**  | AMU-Leader, LFO, Staff-Officer-O-3 | Rank, Authority-Span |
| **A** | **Artifact** | Mission-Blueprint, OKR, AAR | Type, Timestamp, Node-Link |
| **S** | **Service** | HR-OCD, Finance-OCD | SLA, Cost, Capacity |
| **X** | **External Entity** | Freelancer ID 9914, Partner-Agency *BrightMars* | Contract-Type, NDA-Level |

> *Everything else (ideas, risks, metrics) is merely a sub-type of **A** or **S***.

---

## 2 | Canonical edge types (attachments)

| Edge Label | Origin → Target | Semantics | Weight / Properties |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **core-member-of** | P → U | Voting membership, decision rights | %FTE, Start-End |
| **leads** | P → U | Command authority | Grade, Scope |
| **reports-to** | P → P or U | Accountability chain | Cadence |
| **assigned-role** | P → R | Current billet | Grade, Start-End |
| **produces** | U → A | Artifact provenance | KR-link |
| **consumes** | U → S or A | Dependency | Critical/Optional |
| **contracted-to** | X → U | External service | Cost, SLA |
| **resource-of** | S → U | Continuous support | Capacity share |

*(In Notion or any graph DB these are simply relation records; edge weight is stored as properties.)*

## 3 | Unified **career-graph** (tracks + grades)

### 3.1 Grade ladder (common spine for every track)

```
G0  (Intern / Apprentice)  
G1  Specialist-I   |  Officer O-0  (Probe)  
G2  Specialist-II  |  Officer O-1 (LFO)  
G3  Specialist-III |  Officer O-2 (Task-Force Cmd) | Innovator-I  
G4  Principal      |  Officer O-3 (AGS Staff)      | Innovator-II  
G5  Fellow         |  Officer O-4 (Sr Staff)       | Venture-GM  
G6  Partner / LC seat (Officer O-5/6)              | Venture-Partner
```

* A **Person** node carries `grade`, `track` and auto-inherits rights from the grade table.  
* Lateral oscillation = change of the `track` attribute while retaining grade (after board approval).

### 3.2 Up-or-Out rule

Each grade has a **“dwell time” edge property** (`maxMonths`).  
If a Person node fails to satisfy *promotion criteria edges* before `maxMonths`, the `status` flips to *Review → Exit-Ramp*.

---

## 4 | Promotion logic encoded as graph queries

*Officer O-1 ⇒ O-2* (example):

```
MATCH  (p:P {track:'Officer', grade:'O-1'})-[:leads]->(u:U {type:'AMU'})
WHERE  u.krScore > 0.8 AND u.endDate > now() - 12mo
WITH   p, count(u) AS missions
WHERE  missions >= 3
CREATE (p)-[:eligibleFor]->(:Promotion {target:'O-2', date:today})
```

The **Board-of-Officers** page in Notion shows the `eligibleFor` view every quarter.

---

## 5 | Expanded assignment matrix mapped to edges

| Assignment Class | Edge(s) | Typical Duration | Visible in |
|------------------|---------|------------------|------------|
| Core Member | `core-member-of` | Full mission | AMU board |
| Rotational Duty | `core-member-of` w/ `%FTE<50` | 1–3 sprints | Sprint view |
| Flash Attachment | `core-member-of` w/ `ttl<=72h` | <3 days | Incident log |
| Embedded Contractor | `contracted-to`, `core-member-of` | ≤ mission | Contract DB |
| Fractional Specialist | `contracted-to`, `assigned-role` | Retainer | Resource map |
| Partner-AMU | X:External `contracted-to` U:Task-Force | SOW | Vendor dashboard |
| Liaison | `reports-to` both directions | mission span | Dependency graph |

---

## 6 | How experimentation authority travels

*Edge rule:* any node led by **Officer grade ≥ O-1** may link to a new **Experiment Artifact** via `produces`.  
If the artifact’s `validationStatus='positive'`, AGS automatically spawns a **new AMU node** attached by `derived-from`.

Graphically:

```
(LFO O-1) -leads-> (AMU-12) -produces-> (Artifact:ExpReport) -[validated]-> true
▶ AGS listener → CREATE (AMU-13 {mission:'scale experiment'})<-derived-from-(Artifact)
```

Thus LFOs become formal experiment catalysts without extra bureaucracy.

---

## 7 | Example sub-graph (simplified)

```
[P:Alice Kim {grade:'O-1'}] -leads-> [U:AMU #62]
        ↑                        |
reports- |                       | produces
        |                        v
     [P:Bob Dev]  core-member-of  [A:Blueprint]
```

Roll-ups show that AMU #62 is inside Mission-Group *Alpha* which in turn belongs to Task-Force *Helios* under Strategic-Command *Startups*.  
Permissions, notifications, dashboards—everything derives from traversing this sub-graph.

---

## 8 | Why this unified graph achieves “company of commanders”

* **Merit data are native**: Every KR, AAR, and peer rating is already an edge property feeding promotion queries.  
* **Up-or-out is automatic**: Dwell-time check plus eligibility edges fire reminders and, if necessary, exit workflows.  
* **Experimentation is built-in**: LFOs wield a defined edge that spawns new ventures when evidence is strong.  
* **Transparency**: Anyone can traverse the graph (via Notion relations or Neo4j) to see why a person was promoted or why an AMU exists.  
* **Talent magnet**: A-players see an unambiguous path—prove yourself in the field (O-0), command bigger arenas, reach Staff or Council.

---

### Final aphorism

> **“The ACM is not a hierarchy wearing camo; it is a living graph of authority, learning, and value-creation.”**

By treating *every* entity as nodes linked by typed, weighted edges—and by encoding promotion, assignment, and innovation as graph operations—you obtain the meritocratic, high-velocity, *company-of-commanders* culture you’re after.
