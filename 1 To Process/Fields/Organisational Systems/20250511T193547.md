**Understood.**  
You seek definitive nomenclature--a lexicon of **executional artifact types**, rigorously tied to function and authority vector, not legacy naming noise. We will now **standardise the concrete outputs** within each executional cohort: no overlaps, no ambiguity, no multiple names for the same function.
* * *

# **Definitive Typology of Executional Artifacts**

_Mapped to the Five Executional Cohorts: Protocol, Pattern, Instrument, Autonomy, Evidence_

* * *

## I. **Protocol Artifacts**

_Command absolute sequences. Non-negotiable under normal conditions._

| **Artifact Name** | **Purpose** | **Unique Characteristics** | **Canonical Format** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Operational Protocol (OPR)** | Enforces strict sequence of steps for safety or compliance-critical operations | Step-locked, exception-restricted, sign-off gated | Linear procedural doc, numbered steps, exception flags | 
| **Contingency Playbook (CPB)** | Pre-authorised conditional responses to specific scenarios (outages, crises, legal triggers) | If--then branching, owner-specific response triggers | Decision tree or flowchart + appendix actions | 
| **Incident Response Manual (IRM)** | Codified reactions to specific operational incidents (e.g., cybersecurity breach) | Time-sequenced, role-specific, escalation-mapped | Timeline matrix: T+0, T+5, T+15 minutes etc. | 
| **Compliance Action Routine (CAR)** | Procedural routines for regulated tasks (e.g., KYC, audit closure) | Fully auditable, regulator-facing, error-intolerant | Checklist+Log format with timestamp and initials | 
* * *

## II. **Pattern Artifacts**

_Codify reusable structures. Strong defaults, flexible with oversight._

| **Artifact Name** | **Purpose** | **Unique Characteristics** | **Canonical Format** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Execution Template (EXT)** | Structure to initiate a recurring process (e.g., product launch plan) | Pre-filled sections, placeholders, roles preassigned | Editable document or workflow shell | 
| **Critical Checklist (CCL)** | Force-multiplier to avoid human error in step-sensitive contexts | Binary check items, pre-execution or in-process | Checkbox grid with execution timestamp | 
| **Operating Guide (OGD)** | Heuristic-driven best practice guide for consistent task execution | Non-prescriptive, modular, recommendation-based | HTML/Notion page or PDF with version history | 
| **Delivery Blueprint (DBP)** | Modular reference architecture for delivering similar projects | Visual first, modular, input-output clarified | Diagrammatic with textual annotations | 
| **Meeting Codex (MTX)** | Enforced format for decision-making sessions | Roles defined, input/output schema, timing cadence | Pre-filled agenda + action template | 
* * *

## III. **Instrument Artifacts**

_Render system state visible in real time. Drive reflexive operator behaviour._

| **Artifact Name** | **Purpose** | **Unique Characteristics** | **Canonical Format** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Tactical Dashboard (TDS)** | Frontline visibility of live metrics (e.g., sales velocity, error rate) | Real-time update, red-line thresholds, drill-down | KPI tiles + alert logic | 
| **Execution Control Panel (ECP)** | Interactive panel for adjusting live operating parameters | Bi-directional (observe + act), safety locks | Web interface + toggle/config switches | 
| **Signal Board (SGB)** | Visual wallboard of process status (e.g., Kanban, production line) | Status flags, WIP limits, bottleneck indicators | Swimlane or column board, physical or digital | 
| **Escalation Trigger Panel (ETP)** | System of predefined conditions that auto-trigger alerts or shifts | Rule-based alerts, tiered escalation matrix | Alert logic config + contact routing | 
* * *

## IV. **Autonomy Artifacts**

_System-executed logic. Eliminates human intervention in repeatable domains._

| **Artifact Name** | **Purpose** | **Unique Characteristics** | **Canonical Format** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Automation Script (AUS)** | Automate task sequences in code (e.g., test deployment) | CLI-executable, parameterized, version-controlled | Shell script, Python, or YAML | 
| **Bot Protocol (BTP)** | Encapsulated micro-task agent (e.g., triage bot, Slack responder) | Event-triggered, limited domain autonomy | JSON / webhook + backend service | 
| **Workflow Macro (WMC)** | UI-level automation (e.g., CRM pipeline transitions) | Triggered by input pattern, operates on GUI layer | RPA config, flow diagram | 
| **Infrastructure Policy Code (IPC)** | System state enforcement via code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) | Declarative, reproducible, environment-locked | IaC manifest files, linted and gated | 
| **Self-Healing Routine (SHR)** | Automated corrective actions (e.g., service restart on fail) | Reactive, risk-contained, log-producing | Event-rule + executable pairing | 
* * *

## V. **Evidence Artifacts**

_Immutable or auditable records. Close the loop._

| **Artifact Name** | **Purpose** | **Unique Characteristics** | **Canonical Format** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Execution Log File (ELF)** | Time-stamped record of task-level actions | Immutable, machine-generated | JSON/CSV, append-only log | 
| **Outcome Snapshot (OSP)** | Result report from a process or experiment | Tied to baseline expectations, delta-focused | Before/After chart + interpretation | 
| **Performance Review Pack (PRP)** | Periodic aggregation of execution outcomes (weekly/monthly) | KPI evolution, trend lines, narrative commentary | PDF or slide pack with annotated visuals | 
| **Retrospective Report (RTR)** | Formalised review of a deviation, failure, or surprise | Causal trace + preventative insight + sign-offs | Template: Context → Failure → Insight → Change | 
| **Audit Trail Digest (ATD)** | Aggregated, regulator-facing log summaries | Redacted, filtered, signature-locked | Doc with log references and system signature | 
* * *

### Final View: Lexicon Index by Cohort

| Cohort | Canonical Artifact Types | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Protocol** | OPR, CPB, IRM, CAR | 
| **Pattern** | EXT, CCL, OGD, DBP, MTX | 
| **Instrument** | TDS, ECP, SGB, ETP | 
| **Autonomy** | AUS, BTP, WMC, IPC, SHR | 
| **Evidence** | ELF, OSP, PRP, RTR, ATD | 
* * *

### Deployment Protocol

1. **Mandate** a single naming scheme across all teams (no more 7 "playbooks" with 7 different scopes).

2. **Enforce unique artifact IDs** (e.g., `OGD.ENG.2025.03`) -- trackable, referenceable, auditable.

3. **Link directive issuance to artifact production**: Every directive must name the exact artifact type required for compliance.

4. **Establish expiration logic**: each artifact type must have review or kill cadence embedded (e.g., every `OGD` must be reviewed every 6 months, else archived).

5. **Centrally index** in an Execution Artifact Register -- accessible by all operators.

This typology is final until challenged by operational failure.  
It kills ambiguity, eliminates naming bloat, and lets you govern executional infrastructure with the same precision as code.
