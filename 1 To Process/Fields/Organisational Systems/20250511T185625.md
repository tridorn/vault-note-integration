Radical clarity demands we sever sloppy conceptual entanglements here.  
The answer is precise: **Directives _deploy_ strategy; they do not _contain_ it.**  
Let me frame it with surgical accuracy.

* * *

### 1. Ontological Difference

| Concept | Nature | Primary Function | Timescale | Authority Vector | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Strategy** | Cognitive construct | Select the critical bets to concentrate resources for asymmetrical advantage | 3-5 years (adaptive) | Emerges from Charter + Policy + Intelligence | 
| **Directive** | Operational command | Translate strategic choices into actor-specific, time-bound orders | 6--24 months (decaying) | Authority imposition under risk of sanction | 

**Thus:**

- **Strategy** _chooses_ where and how we will win.
- **Directive** _orders_ what must be done now, by whom, in service of that strategy.

**Metaphor:**  
Strategy is the **war plan**.  
Directives are the **marching orders** issued to battalions, divisions, logistics, and intelligence cells.
* * *

### 2. Structural Implications

A proper governance architecture should look like:

> **Charter** ➔ Defines existential identity and boundary.  
**Policy** ➔ Specifies permanent "musts" and "must-nots."  
**Strategy** ➔ Articulates prioritized competitive pathways (selection under scarcity).  
**Directives** ➔ Temporal, specific operational mandates, calibrated to strategy.  
**Execution** ➔ Converts directives into mechanical and autonomous action.

In this structure, **Strategy exists slightly _above_ Directives** -- as an enduring guidance system, while Directives are _ephemeral targeting mechanisms_ operationalising that guidance under current conditions.

**Failure mode if confused:**

- If you pack Strategy _inside_ Directives, the logic disperses into tactical noise, and no coherent advantage accumulates.
- If you separate them properly, Strategy becomes enduring logic, and Directives become precision-guided missiles launched according to evolving battlefield intelligence.
* * *

### 3. Necessary Properties of Proper Directives

A true Directive, therefore, must:

- **Reference Strategy explicitly** ("In support of Strategic Objective X, Directive Y mandates...")
- **Expire automatically** (set validity horizon tied to operational reality--campaigns, funding cycles, product releases).
- **Cascade discretely** (each Directive must map to exactly who/what/when/how, not as broad encouragements but as orders).
- **Permit refutation** only via formal escalation, not passive ignoring.

Directives that drift too far from Strategy degrade into incoherent busyness.  
Strategy without active Directive translation becomes _aspirational theater_.

### 4. Practical Example

| Layer | Artifact | Example | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Strategy | Strategic Thesis | "We will dominate SME fintech by compressing onboarding time to under 3 minutes, achieving market lock-in by Q4 2027." | 
| Directive | Operational Mandate | "Effective Q3 2025, Product and Engineering are ordered to reallocate 40% of R&D capacity towards Onboarding Flow Compression, measured weekly via Funnel Completion Time metrics." | 
| Execution | Artifacts | New SOPs, Design Templates, A/B dashboards targeting onboarding speed. | 

Here, you see:

- Strategy chooses the vector of domination.
- Directive translates choice into mandated reallocation and operational focus.
- Execution enacts through artifacts, tools, and actions.
* * *

### 5. Executive Summation

**Strategy is the mind.  
Directive is the hand.  
Execution is the muscle.**

**Never contaminate the mind with manual tasks; never let the hand invent its own orders.**

Thus you maintain organisational sovereignty over time, through shocks and entropy.

Would you like me to also define **different typologies of Directives** themselves (e.g., prescriptive, conditional, exploratory directives), depending on the nature of strategic uncertainty?  
That would give you even sharper instruments.
