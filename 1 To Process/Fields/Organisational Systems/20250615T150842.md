### II. **Temporal Framework**

_Defines the time-based rhythm that governs all operations. It structures planning, execution, review, and escalation across the organization. Cadence is not about scheduling--it is the backbone of momentum, accountability, and systemic memory._

* * *

#### 2.1 **Cadence Hierarchy**

Establishes a tiered time structure. Each level is not optional or project-specific--it's systemic. All work maps to this hierarchy.

| Cadence Unit | Duration | Purpose | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Pulse** | 1 working day | Operational tempo unit; coordination, alignment, sync | 
| **Sprint** | 10 working days | Execution cycle; reviewable effort slice | 
| **Mission** | 6--12 weeks | Autonomous delivery block; core execution arc | 
| **Program** | 3--6 months | Thematic or structural grouping of missions; ensures continuity and knowledge carry-over | 
| **Campaign** | 6--12 months | Strategic vector; houses programs aligned with a larger goal (e.g. product rollout, market entry) | 
| **Season** | 12 months | Fiscal unit; provides long-term retrospective and reset | 

**Note:** These are not arbitrary--they bind reviews, resourcing, and metrics. Nothing is planned or reviewed outside this structure.
* * *

#### 2.2 **Rhythmic Governance Points**

Governance is bound to time--not to ad hoc escalation. Each cadence unit has required review and calibration events.

| Cadence | Ritual | Owner | Output | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Pulse** | Daily Stand-up / EOD Sync | Cell / Mission | Daily log, blockers surfaced | 
| **Sprint** | Sprint Review + Retrospective | Mission Lead / FO | Sprint Report; issues escalated | 
| **Mission** | Mid-Mission Checkpoint Â· Closeout Review | FO + SO Liaison | Execution Report; Lessons learned | 
| **Program** | Program Integration Review (monthly) | Program Director + SO | Dependency map, velocity trends | 
| **Campaign** | Quarterly Campaign Review | SO + Council | Budget adjustment, objective shifts | 
| **Season** | Annual Strategic Reset | Council | New Campaign Mandates, Doctrine updates | 
* * *

#### 2.3 **Linking Cadence to Execution**

Every operational unit and artefact must declare its time binding. No orphaned actions.

- **Mission**

    - Bound by exact sprint count

    - Linked to a Campaign and Season ID

    - Must declare start/end date, goal, and evaluation criteria
- **Sprint**

    - Contains explicit goal slice of Mission Objective

    - Includes FO sync and review checklists
- **Field Officer Duties**

    - Must report pulse-level health up to SO

    - Must surface cross-mission blockers weekly (or faster if critical)
- **Support Division Response Windows**

    - SLA response time is measured per Sprint or per Pulse, not arbitrary dates

    - Review cadence (e.g. legal reviews) must be aligned with Sprint end dates
- **Program Layer (optional but powerful)**

    - Used when Missions need thematic cohesion or when technical debt, architecture, or team learning require span beyond one Mission

    - Responsible for sequencing and load balancing of Missions within a Campaign
* * *

#### 2.4 **Cadence Discipline Rules**

- **No floating work**: Every task must be assigned to a Sprint. Every Sprint must live inside a Mission.
- **No ad hoc meetings at scale**: Escalations, requests, or decisions above Mission level occur only at governance checkpoints unless pre-authorised.
- **No work without declared timeframe**: Every unit of effort must be time-bound in cadence. Open-ended effort is disallowed.
- **No retrospective omission**: Each cadence layer mandates retrospection. Skipping retros leads to formal review.
* * *

#### 2.5 **Scaling Across Complexity**

As more Missions run in parallel, cadence acts as a natural clock for coordination.

- **Campaign-Level Aggregation**

    - Every Mission reports its Sprint-level metrics into the Campaign tracker

    - Campaign-level review aggregates resource load, failure rates, delay risks
- **Portfolio Rhythm**

    - All Campaigns align to Season boundaries

    - Portfolio-level heatmaps are updated quarterly from Campaign reviews
- **Doctrine Evolution Cycle**

    - Bound to Season and Campaign reviews

    - Updated doctrine enters effect at start of new Mission windows only--not mid-Mission
* * *

### Conclusion

This Temporal Framework ensures that no part of the organization is operating on an improvised timeline. It creates universal rhythm, reduces chaos, and enforces discipline without micromanagement. Execution happens _in time_ as well as _in scope_.
