*Correction → One could phrase your request thus:*  
> “Design a single, coherent talent-architecture—spanning roles, ranks, career tracks, assignments, promotion gates, education loops, and exit rules—so that an ACM company becomes a hard-edged meritocracy in which only proven A-players advance. Unify the Officer Corps, Specialist path, Innovation track, and assignment taxonomy into one elegant machine.”

Below is that unification: **The ACM Talent Lattice.**

---

## 0 Design Axioms  

1. **Prove → Rise, Stall → Out** (*up-or-out, never up-and-stay*).  
2. **Command Is Earned in the Arena** (AMU results are the crucible).  
3. **Doctrine Is Corporate Memory** (contribute or stagnate).  
4. **Fluid Assignments, Rigid Standards** (roles flex, evaluation does not).

## 1 Three Career Tracks, One Rank Spine  

All talent enters one of **three tracks** yet ascends a **shared rank spine**—so equivalence is explicit and cross-track transfers are possible.

| Spine Grade | Officer Track («O») | Specialist Track («S») | Venture/Innovation Track («V») |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **G-0** | Probe Officer (AMU-Lead probation) | Apprentice Specialist | Proto-Innovator |
| **G-1** | Field Officer (LFO) | Specialist | Venture Builder |
| **G-2** | Senior Field / Task-Force Cmdr | Senior Specialist | Senior Builder / Venture PM |
| **G-3** | Staff Officer (AGS Cell Lead) | Principal Specialist | Principal Innovator |
| **G-4** | Senior Staff / Strat-Cmd XO | Distinguished Spec. | Venture General Manager |
| **G-5** | Command Officer (Strat-Cmd) | Fellow | Portfolio GM / SPV CEO |
| **G-6** | Councillor (Leadership Council) | Fellow-Council Seat* | Chief Venture Officer / LC seat |

\* A world-class Fellow may occupy an LC chair as “technical councillor”.

**Cross-track jumps** require completing the *destination* grade’s proving gate.

---

## 2 Assignment Grammar (who goes where, for how long)

| Assignment Token | Scope & Tenure | Eligible Grades | Purpose |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Core-Node** | Full  mission or  permanent | G-0…G-6 | AMU / Staff / Command duty |
| **Rotational** | 1 – 3 sprints | G-0…G-2 | Skill cross-pollination |
| **Flash** | ≤ 72 h | G-1…G-3 | Incident fix, tiger-team |
| **Embedded Contractor** | Mission-bound | any external | Gap fill |
| **Fractional Specialist** | Retainer | G-3+ external | Niche high-skill |
| **Partner-AMU** | Contract SOW | Org-to-Org | Outsourced sub-mission |

A Notion «Assignments» database links People↔Node with token, start, end.

## 3 Promotion & Up-or-Out Algorithm  

### Evaluation Cycle  
- **Quarterly “Tour Review”** for G-0…G-2.  
- **Semi-Annual Review** for G-3+.  

### Tri-Metric Score (0-100 each → composite)  
1. **Mission Outcome Index** (OKR delta, velocity) – 50 %  
2. **Doctrine Contribution Score** (AAR quality, playbooks) – 30 %  
3. **Leadership / Culture NPS** (peer-&-crew 360) – 20 %

| Result | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **≥ 80** | Promotion board eligible if time-in-grade met. |
| **60–79** | Stay in grade, improvement plan. |
| **< 60 two consecutive reviews** | Exit track (downshift to IC or outplacement). |

### Time-in-Grade Limits (hard ceilings)  
| Grade | Max Years | Exception |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| G-0 | 1 | none |
| G-1 | 2 | critical skill gap |
| G-2 | 3 | same |
| G-3 | 4 | same |
| G-4+ | Board discretion |

Failing to promote by the ceiling triggers **mandatory track-switch or separation**.

---

## 4 Education & Culture Engine — *ACM Academy*  

| Layer | Curriculum | Required for |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Foundations** | ACM doctrine, Sprint ops, Feedback hygiene | All G-0 entrants |
| **Command School** | Mission design, conflict resolution, finance 101 | Promotion to G-1 |
| **Staff College** | Scenario planning, intel analysis, portfolio finance | Promotion to G-3 |
| **War-College / Venture Lab** | M&A, macrostrategy, investor relations | Promotion to G-5 |

Completion logged in Notion «Academy Transcript» relation.

## 5 Merit-Visibility Instruments  

1. **Live League Tables** – public Notion board of Mission Outcome scores (gamified).  
2. **Doctrine Leaderboard** – top AARs & playbooks downloaded.  
3. **Venture P&L Dashboards** – each Venture Task-Force P&L linked to its commander’s profile.  
4. **Hall of Commanders** – gallery of G-4+ with mission lineage badges.

---

## 6 Example Talent Journeys  

### A.  Jane – Software Engineer → Specialist → Officer  
1. Joins as S-0 in MVP AMU.  
2. Scores 87; promoted S-1.  
3. Takes rotational AMU-Lead → qualifies for O-0.  
4. Passes Command School, becomes LFO (O-1).  

### B.  Omar – BizDev hire → Venture track  
1. Leads side-hustle AMU (template store) → 180 % KPI hit.  
2. V-1, builds micro-SaaS, raises seed.  
3. After two wins, crosses to O-2 Task-Force Commander for new SaaS line.

---

## 7 Governance Bodies  

- **Board of Officers** (LC chair + AGS chief) – promotions G-1 → G-4.  
- **Council Review** – promotions to G-5 / G-6.  
- **Ethics & Merit Audit** (Compliance OCD + external) – yearly fairness review of scorecards.

## 8 Tooling Snapshot (Notion Implementation Keys)  

| DB | Critical Properties |
|----|---------------------|
| **People** | Track, Grade, Time-in-Grade, Supervisor, Scores (roll-ups) |
| **Assignments** | Node, Token, Start, End, Grade, % Allocation |
| **Academy Transcript** | Course, Grade, Date, Passed |
| **Scorecards** | Quarter, Mission IDs (relation), Composite Score (formula) |
| **Promotion Pipeline** | Candidate ID, Grade-Wanted, Board Date, Status |

Views:  
- “Up-or-Out Deadline” (filter Time-in-Grade > threshold).  
- “Promotion Board Queue.”  
- “Flight Risk” (two sub-60 scores).

---

## 9 Fail-Safe: Maintaining A-Player Density  

- **Hiring Bar**: Only accept top 20 % score equivalent from simulation tasks.  
- **Firing Bar**: Two mediocre tours = redeploy or release.  
- **Compensation Spread**: Steep; each grade ↑ = +20 % comp band, equity kicker ≥ G-3.

---

### Final Synthesis  

The **ACM Talent Lattice** welds together:

* A universal **rank spine** (G-0…G-6),  
* Three orthogonal **prowess tracks** (Officer, Specialist, Innovator),  
* A crisp **assignment grammar**,  
* Up-or-out **evaluation cadences**, and  
* An integrated **education lattice**.

It institutionalises a **perpetual Darwinian meritocracy** where commanders rise by proving themselves in real missions, doctrine is codified by those who learn, and slack is purged quickly—yielding, in your words, *“a company of commanders, a hive of A-players.”*
