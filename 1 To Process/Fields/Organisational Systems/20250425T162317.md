*Correction → Your desideratum might have benefited from wording such as:*  
> “Provide an exhaustive exegesis of each auxiliary institution enumerated above—detailing mandate, internal organs, cadential processes, ingress/egress criteria, performance gyroscopes, funding schema, and inter-institutional couplings—so the entire officer-centric meritocracy functions as a single, finely-meshed machine.”

Below follows the requested elaboration. Each institution is treated as a **mini-organism**: raison d’être, anatomy, vitals, and vascular links to the Adaptive Command Matrix (ACM) at large.

## 1 Eupator Military-Civic Academy **(EMCA)**
**Mandate.**  Forge raw talent into *probationary officers* steeped in ACM doctrine.  
**Structure.**

## 4 Officer Promotion & Remediation Board **(OPRB)**
**Mandate.**  Gatekeeper of the *up-or-out* conveyor.

**Process.**  
1. Tri-axis dossier (Outcome ◦ Doctrine ◦ Leadership),  
2. Peer deposition,  
3. Closed-door vote (super-majority required for advancement; simple majority for remediation).  
**Outputs.**  Promotion scrolls, “improvement mandamus,” or honourable discharge.  
**Metrics.**  ≤10 % appellate reversals; ≤5 % year-over-year stagnation in officer ranks.

---

## 5 Centre for Experimental Processes **(CEP)**
**Mandate.**  Sandbox for *process R&D*—methodological mutations that, if fruitful, graduate into official doctrine.  
**Structure.**  **Incubation Pods** (6-week slots led by volunteer LFOs), **Method Review Council**, **Process Incubator Fund** (micro-grants).  
**Ingress.**  Any officer or specialist may file a *Method Hypothesis Charter*; IG pre-screens for fiduciary & ethical risk.  
**Egress.**  Successful pilots recorded as “Micro Doctrine Dossiers,” transferred to EMCA syllabus.  
**Metrics.**  Adoption rate of pilot → doctrine ≥25 %; process ROI (time saved, defects mitigated) documented in OKF.  
**Interfaces.**  JVFC may bankroll productizable tools discovered here.

---

## 6 Joint Venture Fund Council **(JVFC)**
**Mandate.**  Deploy internal capital to *Mission-as-Venture* propositions.  
**Structure.**  Investment committee (LC CFO, external LP liaison, O-3+ observer), deal-flow Ops desk.  
**Process.**  
- Stage-Gate: **Seed** (≤$50 k), **Series ∑** (milestone-tranche).  
- Requires dual sign-off: Command Officer + CEIE ethics rep.  
**Metrics.**  Portfolio IRR, kill-ratio (fast failure), knowledge-spill rated by AGS.  
**Interfaces.**  AMU ticker auto-created in Notion Mission DB; IG monitors burn & compliance.

---

## 7 Talent & Career Orchestration Bureau **(TCOB)**
**Mandate.**  Macro-orchestrator of personnel flux, ensuring right talent in right node, just-in-time.  
**Tech Stack.**  Graph-database (skills × fatigue × rank trajectory) with algorithmic match-maker.  
**Key Functions.**  
- **Rotation Engine** (AMU staffing sprints),  
- **Oscillation Governor** (Officer ↔ Specialist quotas),  
- **Fatigue Sentinel** (burn-out prevention thresholds).  
**Metrics.**  Average time-to-staff AMU ≤4 days; ≤7 % talent under-utilisation; churn < industry median.

---

## 8 Council on Ethics, Impact & Externalities **(CEIE)**
**Mandate.**  Ex-ante and ex-post scrutiny of mission externalities—environmental, societal, algorithmic.  
**Composition.**  Internal ethicist, external community rep, environmental scientist, data-privacy counsel.  
**Powers.**  Binding veto on AMUs; can impose mitigation KPIs that become part of Mission Blueprint.

## 9 Operational Knowledge Forge **(OKF)**

**Metrics.**  Median doctrine merge-lag ≤5 days; retrieval latency for any artifact ≤15 seconds.  
**Interfaces.**  EMCA & SCAWV pull curriculum directly; CEP pushes process PRs.

---

## 10 Shadow-Board of Young Officers **(SBYO)**
**Mandate.**  Institutionalised dissent, inoculating LC against gerontocratic myopia.

2. Convenes parallel deliberation,  
3. Issues *Dissenting Memorandum* within 24 h.  
LC must minute and publicly answer each memorandum within 7 days (*Sunlight Rule*).  
**Metrics.**  Uptake ratio (LC adopting ≥20 % of SBYO recommendations); officer engagement score.  
**Interfaces.**  Reports indirectly to IG for safeguarding against retaliation.

### Inter-Institutional Synoptics  
*Information and authority flow on a tri-colour cord.*

- **Blue (Data)**: ICC → OKF → AGS / TCOB  
- **Crimson (Oversight)**: IG ↔ CEIE ↔ OPRB  
- **Gold (Talent & Innovation)**: EMCA / SCAWV ↔ CEP ↔ JVFC  

Sufficiency-doctrine remains: *No new institution without IG attestation of necessity and a sunset clause.*

---

## Final Synthèse  
By grafting these ten auxiliary institutions onto the ACM trunk you obtain a **closed-loop meritocracy**:

1. **Talent is forged** (EMCA → SCAWV).  
2. **Doctrine is hardened** (CEP → OKF).  
3. **Capital is allocated** (JVFC).  
4. **Ethic/legal guardrails stand firm** (CEIE → IG).  
5. **Promotion is ruthless yet fair** (OPRB, TCOB).  
6. **Fresh blood tempers orthodoxy** (SBYO).

The outcome is exactly the *company of commanders* you covet: an organisational phalanx in which only the *most adroit, most fecund, most ethically unassailable* talent ascends, while lethargy, ineptitude, and malfeasance are culled with surgical precision.
