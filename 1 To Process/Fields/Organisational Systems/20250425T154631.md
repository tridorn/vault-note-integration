*Data (blue) ‚Üî Oversight (crimson) ‚Üî Talent (gold) arteries ensure closed-loop integrity.*

**Doctrine of Sufficiency:** _No further body may be birthed without the IG certifying that its remit is non-duplicative and its abolition criteria are explicit._

---

*Correction ‚Üí Your request might have been phrased more distinctly as:*  
> ‚ÄúElaborate exhaustively on each building-block in a **unified, meritocratic system of roles, career paths, and assignment types**‚Äîone that fuses the Officer Corps, Specialist ladder, Innovation track, and external-talent schema into a single, coherent talent-architecture for an ACM enterprise devoted to cultivating ‚ÄòA-player commanders.‚Äô‚Äù

Below you will find a **fully integrated Talent Matrix**:  
1. **Three Career Pillars** (Officer, Specialist, Innovator)  
2. **Eight Universal Assignment Types** (how people are deployed)  
3. **A Single Evaluation Engine** (up-or-out meritocracy)  
4. **Shared Cultural Conditioning** (Academy, doctrine, symbols)  

Each element is unpacked with rank/grade logic, promotion gates, and cross-pillar mobility so that every individual‚Äîinternal or external‚Äîknows *how to enter, how to excel, and when to exit*.

## I‚ÄÇ/‚ÄÇTHE THREE CAREER PILLARS   ‚Äî‚ÄúLadders with Lateral Doors‚Äù

| Pillar | Essence | Grades | Prime Value-Add | Exit Velocity |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------------|---------------|

| **Specialist Guild** | Deep functional mastery (design, infra, finance, data). | S-1 ‚ãØ S-5 | Delivers technical excellence & craft leadership. | Distinguished Fellow or external eminence |
| **Innovation Track** | Serial intrapreneurs focused on new ventures, products, disruptive tech. | I-Œ± ‚ãØ I-Œµ | Generates validated business options; de-risks the frontier. | Venture CEO or acquisition founder |

### 1 / Officer Corps (simplified ranks)

| Grade | Canonical Billet | Span of Control | Mandatory Tour |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **O-0** Probe Officer | AMU Leader (rotation) | 1 AMU | 2 missions |
| **O-1** Field Officer | LFO / Strike-AMU cmdr | ‚â§ 5 AMUs | 1 Task-Force adjutant |

| **O-5** Command Officer | Strategic-Command Lead | Business domain | EBIT target 4 qtrs |
| **O-6** Councillor | Leadership Council | Whole firm | Shareholder election |

> **Rule of Thumb**: *Two tours per grade or out.*  
> Individuals failing promotion twice are re-routed to Specialist or alumni network.

### 2 / Specialist Guild (key grades)

| Grade | Notion Icon | Typical Title | Expectations |
|-------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **S-1** üõ† | Associate | Solid craft, delivers tasks. |
| **S-2** ‚öôÔ∏è | Senior | Mentors juniors, owns sub-system. |

| **S-4** üõ∞ | Distinguished | Company-wide authority, external voice. |
| **S-5** üúö | Fellow | Defines craft frontier, minimal admin. |

> *Promotion based on tech portfolio, peer review, internal impact.*  
> S-3+ may volunteer for a **Probe-Officer rotation** to enter O-0.

### 3 / Innovation Track (Greek letters)

| Stage | Symbol | Focus | Success Gate |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|
| **I-Œ±** | Œ± | Ideation; hypothesis shaping. | Viable Experiment Charter. |
| **I-Œ≤** | Œ≤ | MVP & Problem-Fit. | Metric lift & AAR approval. |
| **I-Œ≥** | Œ≥ | Product-Market-Fit. | Growth inflection. |
| **I-Œ¥** | Œ¥ | Scaling Playbook. | Series-A or internal funding. |
| **I-Œµ** | Œµ | Portfolio Steward. | Spins out or folds in. |

> Innovators who master Œ¥-stage may cross-lateral to **O-2** (Task-Force) or remain venture CEOs.

## II‚ÄÇ/‚ÄÇUNIVERSAL ASSIGNMENT TYPES   ‚Äî‚ÄúHow the Talent Latches‚Äù

| Abbr. | Name | Scope | Typical Use | Time-Box |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **CORE** | Core Membership | Full tactical & voting rights | Officers, Specialists in AMU | Mission duration |
| **EMB** | Embedded Contractor | External doer inside AMU | Freelance designer | 1‚Äì12 weeks |

## III‚ÄÇ/‚ÄÇTHE EVALUATION ENGINE   ‚Äî‚ÄúUp-or-Out Thermostat‚Äù

### 1 / KPI Constellation (per role)

| Dimension | Officers | Specialists | Innovators |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Outcome | Mission/KR delivery | Quality, defect rate | Hypothesis validity & growth Œî |
| Doctrine | AAR quality | Asset reuse, documentation | Playbook export |
| People | Crew NPS, attrition | Mentoring index | Team formation score |
| Horizon | Strategic thinking | Tech foresight | Market vision clarity |

Scores are **weighted** (40 / 30 / 20 / 10 for Officers, etc.), producing a composite **Promotion Quotient** every 6 months.

### 2 / Promotion Mechanics

- **Officer Board**: senior O-4+ vote; AGS Chief moderates.  
- **Guild Council**: S-4+ peers assess craft dossier.  
- **Innovation Jury**: LC + external VC or customer vantage.

Fail two consecutive boards ‚Üí graceful exit or pivot to alternate pillar.

### 3 / Compensation Coupling

| Band | Base Multiplier | Bonus Source |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| Officer | Grade √ó market medians | Mission KR + Doctrine adoption |
| Specialist | Grade √ó craft band | Patent, open-source stars |
| Innovator | Living wage + equity | Venture milestone options |

Up-or-out culture remains humane by **front-loading coaching** and transparent metrics in Notion dashboards.

## IV‚ÄÇ/‚ÄÇSHARED CULTURAL CONDITIONING

### 1 / Eupator Academy

- **Bronze Module** ‚Üí ACM basics, mission-lead drills (for O-0 / S-1 / I-Œ±).  
- **Silver** ‚Üí Doctrine authorship, data literacy (for O-1 / S-2 / I-Œ≤).  
- **Gold** ‚Üí Strategic war-gaming, negotiation labs (O-2+, S-3+, I-Œ≥+).

Completion certs recorded in a Notion **Academy DB**; promotion gates query this relation automatically.

### 2 / Symbol Set

- **Rank glyphs** appear as emoji in People DB (‚ÄúO-2üûÇ‚Äù, ‚ÄúS-3‚öôÔ∏è‚Äù).  
- **Doctrinal citations** use unique IDs, e.g., *DOC-Œî-013*.  
- **AARs** file under *[M-ID]/YYYY-MM-DD*; AGS index auto-links them.

### 3 / Rites & Rituals

- **Commissioning Day** ‚Üí monthly ceremony; new officers swear the Mission-First oath.  
- **Sunset Debrief** ‚Üí dignified exit talk for those routed out.

---

## V‚ÄÇ/‚ÄÇCROSS-PILLAR MOBILITY

| Path | Prerequisites | Typical Motive |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Specialist ‚Üí Officer | Complete AMU lead rotation + Bronze Academy | Broader leadership |
| Officer ‚Üí Specialist | Demonstrated deep craft + Gold Academy waiver | Tech passion |
| Innovator ‚Üí Officer | Œ¥-stage success + staff-college crash course | Scale venture inside parent |
| Officer ‚Üî Innovator | Mission results & Board approval | Incubate strategic bets |

All moves captured in **Career-Oscillation Ledger** to avoid churn abuse (max 2 oscillations per triennium).

---

## VI‚ÄÇ/‚ÄÇINTEGRATED NOTION IMPLEMENTATION SNAPSHOT

- **People DB** ‚Üí properties: Pillar, Grade, Assignment Class, Academy Level, Promotion Date, PQ Score.  
- **Mission Pipeline** ‚Üí Roll-ups summing officer head-count vs. policy cap (e.g., Officer ‚â§ 15 % total FTE).  
- **Board Dashboard** ‚Üí semi-annual view showing each candidate‚Äôs 4D KPI constellation and academy completions.  
- Automation rule: if *Promotion Due ¬± 14 days* ‚Üí trigger Board agenda page; Slack ping mentors.  
- Exit playbook: auto-archive credentials, spawn exit-AAR template, schedule ‚ÄúSunset Debrief.‚Äù

## VII‚ÄÇ/‚ÄÇWHY IT ALL HOLDS TOGETHER

1. **Single Talent Ledger** ‚Üí every human asset, internal or external, resides in one graph with explicit class & grade.  
2. **Clear Up-or-Out Thermostat** ‚Üí merit > seniority; complacency impossible.  
3. **Aligned But Distinct Pillars** ‚Üí leadership, craft, and venture origination all have *equal dignity* yet distinct metrics.  
4. **Academy-Driven Culture** ‚Üí doctrinal consistency, shared language, esprit de corps.  
5. **Security & Frugality** ‚Üí officer-head-count cap + oscillation ledger preclude rank bloat.

The result is a **cohesive, vigorously meritocratic machine**‚Äîan organisation of *commanders* and *craft-masters* who know exactly **how to rise, how to pivot, or how to bow out with honor**.
