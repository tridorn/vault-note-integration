Below is a **single, radically-orthogonal talent lattice** whose three axes never overlap yet fit together like gears:

| **Axis** | **Question it answers** | **Units on the axis** | **How many may a person hold at once? |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **HORIZONTAL = Expertise Grade** | *“How deep is your craft?”* | **E-bands (E0–E5)** | **Exactly one** |
| **VERTICAL = Command Rank** | *“How large is your span of command?”* | **O-ranks (O0–O6)** | **Exactly one** |
| **ASSIGNMENT = Current Attachment** | *“Where are you presently slotted?”* | **A-classes (A1–A6)** | **Zero – Many** |

A person is always stamped **E-α / O-β [+ (A-x, A-y…)]**.  
Example: *E3 Senior Specialist · O1 Field Officer · A2 Rotational Duty in AMU “Helios”*.

---

## 1 │ Horizontal Axis — **Expertise Grades (E-bands)**  
*(Pure merit in one craft; never confers authority outside the craft.)*

| **Band** | Canonical Label | Competence Description | Promotion Gate* | Up-or-Out Window |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **E0** | Apprentice | Basic literacy in domain; works from playbook | Mentor sign-off | 6 mo |
| **E1** | Practitioner | Executes independently on routine problems | Deliver 2 sprint goals solo | 1 yr |
| **E2** | Specialist | Solves non-routine problems; mentors E0 | Publish 1 AAR insight | 18 mo |
| **E3** | Sr. Specialist | Designs frameworks; owns sub-domain | Lead 1 cross-team initiative | 2 yr |
| **E4** | Principal | Recognised org-wide SME; sets standards | Org adoption of authored doctrine | 3 yr |
| **E5** | Fellow | Industry-level authority; shapes strategy | External citation + LC vote | N/A |

\*Promotion gated by tri-axis score: **Outcome, Peer review, Doctrine contribution**.

---

## 2 │ Vertical Axis — **Officer Ranks (O-ranks)**  
*(Command capability; carries line authority but not craft superiority.)*

| **Rank** | Title | Typical Billet | Span (max people) | Promotion Conditions |
|----------|-------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **O0** | Probe Officer | Rotational AMU Leader | 15 | Two successful AMUs & officer exam |
| **O1** | Field Officer | LFO (Mission Group) | 50 | 1 yr as O0 + Field board |
| **O2** | Senior Field | Task-Force Cmdr | 150 | Successful TF P&L or crisis AMU |
| **O3** | Staff Officer | AGS Cell Lead | — | Publish 2 doctrines + LC sponsor |
| **O4** | Sr. Staff | AGS Chief / Strat-Cmd XO | 3 TFs | Board of Officers vote |
| **O5** | Command Officer | Strategic-Command Lead | 1 K+ | Org-level OKR hit + Board |
| **O6** | Councillor | Leadership Council Seat | Whole org | Extraordinary LC vote |

*Up-or-out:*  O0→O1 18 mo · O1→O2 30 mo · O2+ compete but may plateau.

---

## 3 │ Assignment Classes — **A-taxonomy (streamlined)**  
*(Purely “Where are you right now?” — never a grade or rank.)*

| **Code** | Label | Authority in Node | Typical Tenure | Primary Use |
|----------|-------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **A1 Core** | Permanent Core Member | Full voting | Life of node | Node founders / FTE staff |
| **A2 Rotational** | Sprint-cycle Member | Full during stint | 1–3 sprints | Skill broadening |
| **A3 Surge** | Crisis/Flash | Tactical only | ≤ 72 h | Incident & hot-fixes |
| **A4 Advisor** | Non-binding counsel | None | Episodic | SMEs, mentors |
| **A5 Embedded Contractor** | Operational external | Functional | Mission-bounded | Freelancers, agencies |
| **A6 Liaison** | Info conduit | Procedural | As long as dependency | Cross-node / partner link |

All previous variants (secretariat, audit, etc.) are simply **A1 Core** roles inside an OCD; apprenticeship is **E0 A2**; fractional execs are **A5**.

## 4 │ How the Axes Interlock

```
┌─────────── Command (O) ───────────┐
│             ↑                     │
│    O2  Senior Field Officer       │
│             ↑                     │
│    O1  Field Officer (LFO)        │  ← Example Person
│             ↑                     │
│    O0  Probe Officer              │
└─────────────┬─────────────────────┘
              │
              │  (E3)  Sr. Specialist – Growth Analytics
              │
              └───────── Expertise (E)
```
The same individual may carry multiple *A* assignments over time:

> **Profile today:**  
>   `E3 / O1 / A2 Rotational in AMU “Helios”`  
> **Profile next quarter:**  
>   `E3 / O2 / A1 Core in Task-Force “Pegasus”`  

Their craft depth (E-band) is stable; their command span (O-rank) advanced; their assignment changed.

## 5 │ Meritocratic Engine

1. **Quantified Score-card** *(updated each sprint)*  
   - **Mission Outcome (60 %)** KR attainment vs baseline  
   - **Doctrine Impact (20 %)** Artifacts adopted org-wide  
   - **Peer-Leadership NPS (20 %)** Anonymised 360s  

2. **Promotion Cycles**  
   - **Quarterly** for E-bands (panel of Principals).  
   - **Bi-annual** for O-ranks (Board of Officers).  

3. **Up-or-Out Trigger**  
   - Missing promotion gate → 3-month remediation.  
   - Second miss → mandatory lateral transfer or exit.

4. **Officer Academy**  
   - All O-candidates complete a 6-week part-time course (ACM doctrine, finance, experimentation).  
   - Graduation is pre-requisite for O0 commissioning.

## 6 │ Cultural Guarantees

| Mechanism | Ensures |
|-----------|---------|
| Dual-axis lattice | A brilliant craftsperson can stay E-centric; a born commander can rise O-centric. |
| A-classes decouple placement | No career penalty for taking a short surge or advisory role. |
| Up-or-Out | Stagnation impossible; only growth or graceful exit. |
| Public dashboards | All scores, gates, and vacancies transparent—pure meritocracy. |

### Epilogue

With **E-bands** (depth), **O-ranks** (scope), and **A-classes** (current slot) cleanly orthogonal, **every human artefact in Eupator is locatable**:  
*how masterful*, *how much command*, *doing what right now*.  
That is the operating system of an “A-player armada”—a company of commanders.
