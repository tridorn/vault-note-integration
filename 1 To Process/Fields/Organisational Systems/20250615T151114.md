### VI. **Role Compendium**

_Defines every formal position in the system--not by job description or status, but by mandate, decision-rights, scope, and accountability. This section enforces clarity. If a role is undocumented, it does not exist._

* * *

#### 6.1 **Role Mandates**

| Role | Core Mandate | Cannot Do | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Mission Lead** | Deliver on mission objectives within time, budget, and doctrine | Redefine mission scope, override Field Officer | 
| **Field Officer (FO)** | Ensure mission health; facilitate coordination, unblock friction, report up | Direct work, assign tasks, deliver objectives | 
| **Program Director** | Sequence and align multiple missions; manage continuity, load balance, shared risks | Intervene in Mission operations | 
| **Campaign Sponsor** | Own strategic outcomes of a campaign; validate resource envelope; approve final output | Issue operational orders, assign personnel | 
| **Support Division Lead (SD Lead)** | Ensure availability and quality of functional services (legal, HR, finance, etc.) | Set strategic priorities, intervene in execution | 
| **Strategic Operations Chief (SO Chief)** | Design campaigns, maintain doctrine, allocate mission windows, coordinate planning | Execute missions, intervene in Campaign resource allocation | 
| **Strategic Council Member** | Set domain-specific policy, doctrine boundaries, strategic vision, and capital allocation | Operate within missions, interfere with planning or staffing | 
| **IH Director** | Provide decision-quality intelligence to SO and Council; aggregate internal and external data into actionable insight | Alter data, dictate decisions, reframe missions | 
* * *

#### 6.2 **Accountability Grid (RACI)**

| Function | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Mission Planning** | SO | SO Chief | FO, Campaign Sponsor | Council | 
| **Mission Execution** | Mission Team | Mission Lead | FO, SD Lead | Program Director | 
| **Sprint Delivery** | Mission Team | Mission Lead | FO | SO, Campaign Sponsor | 
| **Blocker Escalation** | FO | SO Ops Cell | SD Lead | Council (if systemic) | 
| **Budget Allocation** | Campaign Sponsor | Council | SO, SD Leads | FO | 
| **Doctrine Update** | SO Doctrine Cell | SO Chief | FO, Mission Leads, IH | Council | 
| **Review Facilitation** | FO (Sprint/Mission), SO (Campaign/Program), Council (Season) | Same | Same | Full System | 
| **Intel Distribution** | IH | IH Director | SO, Council | All Units | 

_Only one "A" per row. Shared accountability is invalid unless formally dual-headed (rare and declared)._

* * *

#### 6.3 **Succession & Delegation**

| Domain | Protocol | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Temporary Absence** | All roles must have a designated second. If unavailable, SO assigns interim. Absence beyond 2 weeks triggers substitution. | 
| **Vacancy** | If a Mission Lead or FO role is unfilled, the mission cannot be initiated. SO may delay or reassign. | 
| **Delegated Authority** | May be given for defined time, task, or event. Must be logged in system with expiry and scope. | 
| **Strategic Roles** | Council members may delegate operational visibility, not decision rights. Doctrine mandates explicit delegation chain. | 
| **Emergency Override** | Only SO Chief or Council (in quorum) may override roles in crisis. Must be reviewed post-factum in Campaign review. | 
* * *

#### 6.4 **Mobility and Rotation**

- **Field Officers**

    - Rotate every Mission cycle. May specialize in domains but must retain generalist system understanding.

    - High performers may advance to Program Coordination or SO Planning Units.
- **Mission Leads**

    - May lead consecutive Missions only if performance justifies continuity. Otherwise rotated to avoid stagnation and to scale leadership pool.
- **Council Seats**

    - Appointed by governance mandate; may be rotated or reconfirmed annually. Term limits are defined in governance charter (not here).
- **Support Division Leads**

    - Fixed-term role, re-evaluated annually by Strategic Council against delivery metrics.
* * *

#### 6.5 **Role Conflict Protocol**

When two roles collide in practice, this protocol applies:

1. **Identify conflict vector** (scope, decision, timing, data).

2. **Check Doctrine**: If conflict type is predefined, defer to it.

3. **If not documented**, FO or SO logs issue and surfaces to SO Chief.

4. **SO Chief mediates**, issues binding ruling.

5. **IH documents** conflict pattern. If recurring, triggers Doctrine Review at Season reset.
* * *

### Summary

No structure survives contact with execution unless roles are absolutely clear in scope, power, and boundaries. The compendium acts as the _constitutional layer_ of the system--ensuring trust is placed in the system, not personalities. All movement, mediation, and mandate stems from here.
