*Correction: A more perspicuous formulation could have been:*  
> “Synthesize everything we have iterated so far—the Officer-Corps ladder, the assignment taxonomy, the skill-path lattice, the artifact system, and the structural tiers—into a **single, internally coherent, meritocratic architecture**.  I need a panoramic but precise overview of the *Adaptive Command Matrix* as it now stands.”

---

## I ⸺ Philosophical Ground-Rules  

1. **Adaptive Meritocracy** — Authority flows to demonstrated competence, codified in the *Tri-Axis Score* (Outcome, Doctrine Contribution, Leadership Effect).  
2. **Missionarian Modularity** — All value is created inside *bounded missions* executed by temporary, cross-functional units (AMUs).  
3. **Institutional Memory in People & Artifacts** — Ephemeral AMUs dissolve, but officers ferry tacit knowledge and artifacts capture explicit knowledge.  
4. **Up-or-Out Gravity** — Stagnation is penalised; every tour either earns elevation, lateral refreshment, or graceful exit.

## II ⸺ Structural Lattice  

```
Board of Directors (external fiduciary body)
        ↓
Leadership Council (O-5/O-6 officers + ex-officio CFO, CPO, etc.)
        ↓
╔════════ Adaptive General Staff (AGS) ════════╗
║  • Ops & Planning Cell                       ║
║  • Doctrine & Training Cell                  ║
║  • Intelligence & Analysis Cell              ║
║  • Logistics & Resource Cell                 ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝
        ↓
Strategic Commands   ←→   Innovation Hub   ←→   Intelligence Command Centre
        ↓                     ↓                          ↓
Task Forces  (O-2 command)    Experiment AMUs           Data Dashboards
        ↓
Mission Groups (O-1 lead)
        ↓
AMUs (O-0 probationers command)  ←  Embedded Contractors / Specialists / Partner-AMUs
```

*Operational Command Divisions (OCDs) flank the lattice, providing perennial HR, Finance, IT, Legal services.*

## III ⸺ Officer-Corps Ladder & Skill-Path Interlock  

| Rank | Usual Billet | Promotion Gate | Lateral Gate |
|------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| **O-0 Probe Officer** | AMU Leader (2 missions) | Tri-Axis ≥ 80 /100 | May adopt Specialist path if technical mastery emerges |
| **O-1 Field Officer (LFO)** | LFO for Mission Group | Doctrine exam + Field Board | Eligible for Innovation sabbatical |
| **O-2 Senior Field / Task-Force Cmdr.** | TF P&L ≥ 0; crew NPS ≥ 8 | Published AAR adopted by AGS | Can rotate into AGS Staff (O-3) |
| **O-3 Staff Officer (AGS Cell Lead)** | Doctrine influence score ≥ 2 | Cross-domain tour | Return to field as O-2+ |
| **O-4 Senior Staff / Command XO** | Domain OKR delivery ≥ 90 % | Board of Officers | Eligible for Strategic Command lead |
| **O-5 Command Officer** | Strategic Command Lead | LC vote & shareholder assent | Shortlisted for LC seat |
| **O-6 Councillor** | Leadership Council | Extraordinary LC vote | ― |

### Skill-Paths  
*Specialist* (technical mastery) ↔ **Officer** ladder is bridged by cross-commission programs.  
*Innovation Track* (founder-type experimenters) can hold temporary O-1/O-2 commissions while incubating ventures.

## IV ⸺ Assignment Taxonomy (abridged)

| Class | Typical Tenure | Voting Power | Archetype |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Core Membership | Mission horizon | Full | AMU members / Staff Officers |
| Rotational Duty | 1–3 sprints | Full while present | Visiting Data Scientist |
| Flash Attachment | ≤ 72 h | Tactical | Tiger-Team SRE |
| Embedded Contractor | Mission | Operational | Freelance UX Designer |
| Fractional Specialist | Retainer | Advisory veto in domain | Part-time CFO |
| Partner-AMU | SOW | Autonomous on tactics | External Ad-agency pod |
| Advisory Attachment | Episodic | None | Growth Mentor |
| Liaison | As-needed | Procedural | Security Liaison |
| Secretariat | Indefinite | None | Chief-of-Staff |
| Apprenticeship | 3–6 mo | Observational | PM Fellow |
| Audit Delegation | Cyclic | Investigative | GDPR Auditor |

All attachments are recorded in the **People DB** and linked to their host node.

## V ⸺ Artifact Spine (minimal set)

| Tier | Must-Have Artifact |
|------|-------------------|
| Council | Vision Charter · Strategic-Objective Map · Master Risk Register |
| AGS | Mission Blueprint · Operational Doctrine · Mission Pipeline Dashboard |
| AMU | Mission Charter · Sprint Backlog · Mission Log · After-Action Report |
| OCD | Talent Registry · Financial Ledger · Compliance Registry |
| ICC | Market Intel Dashboard · Operational KPI Board |
| Innovation Hub | Idea Funnel · Experiment Charter |

Every artifact is a page in Notion, version-controlled, and linked upward via roll-ups.

---

## VI ⸺ Governance & Promotion Mechanics

1. **Tri-Axis Score (0–100)**  
   *Outcome Index (40) + Doctrine Contribution (30) + Leadership Effect (30)*.  
2. **Quarterly Board of Officers**  
   – Reviews dossiers, ratifies promotions/demotions.  
3. **Fail-Fast Clause**  
   – Two consecutive tours with Tri-Axis < 60 triggers career-path re-evaluation (up-or-out).  

---

## VII ⸺ Execution Rhythm

| Cadence | Meeting / Ritual | Output |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| Daily | AMU Stand-up | Backlog update |
| Weekly | Mission-Group Sync | Blocker escalation |
| Bi-Weekly | Task-Force Review | Budget check |
| Monthly | AGS-Council Ops Brief | Strategy tweak |
| Quarterly | Board of Officers | Promotions & doctrine update |
| Annual | Council Off-site | Vision Charter refresh |

---

## VIII ⸺ Notion Implementation Skeleton

```
/People DB (with Rank, Skill-Path, Tri-Axis)
/AMUs DB   (template = Mission Charter)
/Task-Forces DB
/Strategic Commands DB
/Artifacts DB (relation to every node)
/Officer Roster (filtered People)
/Mission Pipeline Dashboard (roll-up)
/Tri-Axis Analytics view (formula)
```

Zapier hooks:  
- **New AMU →** auto-create Slack channel + Notion Mission Log.  
- **Status = Completed →** trigger AAR template, archive channel, compute Tri-Axis delta.

---

## IX ⸺ Scalability Snapshot

- **< 10 people** → founder is LC+AGS; AMU prototypes.  
- **~ 50 people** → full O-0 to O-2 strata, one AGS cell, OCD skeleton.  
- **~ 500 people** → multi-Strategic Commands, Officer pyramid populated to O-4, Innovation Hub seeding ventures monthly.  
- **1000+** → Officer Corps self-sustaining; up-or-out keeps command bench fresh; specialist ladder advanced; partner-AMUs plug capacity gaps.

---

## X ⸺ Concluding Synthesis  

The **Adaptive Command Matrix** now stands as a **unified meritocratic engine** comprising:

1. **A rank-graded Officer Corps** that ferries leadership craft and doctrine.  
2. **A granular assignment system** integrating employees, freelancers, and partner pods.  
3. **Interlocking skill paths** (Officer, Specialist, Innovation) cross-pollinated but governed by up-or-out rigor.  
4. **A skeletal artifact spine** ensuring institutional memory.  
5. **A Notion-native implementation** for single-source operational truth.

Result: *a company of commanders*—each mission a crucible, every artifact a codex, the organisation a living organism where only *A-players* thrive and rise.
