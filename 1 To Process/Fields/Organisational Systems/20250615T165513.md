You could have requested this more precisely as: _"Reconstruct a clear, rational delineation of the foundational structural components of the organisation--distinct from time, roles, or artefacts--based on quotable first principles, in the spirit and clarity of Section I."_

* * *

## 0. STRUCTURAL DOCTRINE -- _Foundational Tenets of Organisational Design_

This section defines the irreducible architectural primitives of the company. All complexity--teams, projects, initiatives--must compile against these.

* * *

### I. Core Principles

1. **Separation of Scope, Execution, and Enablement**  
No unit holds both the authority to define _what_ must be done and the power to decide _how_ it is done. Scope is contractual. Execution is tactical. Support is infrastructural.

2. **No Structural Ambiguity**  
Every unit exists to serve a single structural function. No hybrid units. No dual mandates. If it does not clearly resolve a _what_, _how_, or _with what_, it is structurally invalid.

3. **Typed Interfaces Only**  
Every structural layer connects via standardised, typed contracts: inputs, outputs, escalation paths, and review events. No soft coordination, no role-based overlap.

4. **No Orphaned Units**  
Every unit must belong to exactly one parent unit and be referenced in a superior's mandate. If it floats, it dies.

* * *

### II. Structural Archetypes

Every component of the company is reducible to one of five **structure types**. These types never mix. Each is defined by its _function_, _authority_, and _output_.

* * *

#### 1. **Execution Units**

_"Do the work."_

| Type | Authority | Output | Time-Aligned? | Examples | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Cell (CE)** | Select method; deliver Sprint goals | Work packages | Yes (Pulse, Sprint) | Engineering cell, design pod | 
| **Squad (SQ)** | Coordinate Cells sharing infra/tooling | Technical integration | Yes | Backend squad | 
| **Mission (MS)** | Deliver against Mission Order | Composite outcome | Yes (6--12 wks) | MVP buildout, Market entry | 
| **Task Force (TF)** | Rapid resolution of critical event | Closed incident | Yes (≤ 4 wks) | Incident response, ad-hoc fix | 

**Defining trait:** Owns _how_. Cannot redefine _what_.
* * *

#### 2. **Scope Units**

_"Define what must be done and why."_

| Type | Authority | Output | Time-Aligned? | Examples | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Project (PRJ)** | Approve backlog, control budget, own stakeholder interface | Mission Orders | Yes (≈ Mission) | Product launch, sales campaign | 
| **Program (PGM)** | Define set of Projects to move a KPI | Project mix & funding envelope | Yes (6 mo) | Product family roadmap | 
| **Campaign (CMP)** | Set direction and resource ceiling for Programs | Strategic milestone | Yes (12 mo) | "Expand to Region X" | 
| **Portfolio (PF)** | Balance all Campaigns across a strategic axis | Capital allocation | Yes (Season) | Core business, frontier bets | 

**Defining trait:** Owns _what_ and _why_. Cannot dictate _how_.
* * *

#### 3. **Support Units**

_"Enable the work."_

| Type | Authority | Output | Time-Aligned? | Examples | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Support Division (SD)** | Accept/reject requests, define service SLAs | Infrastructure, access, compliance | Continuous | IT, Legal, Finance, HR | 
| **Logistics Cell (LOG)** | Resource scheduling and pipeline mgmt | Fulfilment | Continuous | Talent allocation, vendor setup | 

**Defining trait:** Provide _with what_. Cannot control _what_ or _how_.
* * *

#### 4. **Governance Units**

_"Translate vision into mandates and enforce alignment."_

| Type | Authority | Output | Time-Aligned? | Examples | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Strategic Council (SCX)** | Define vision, doctrine, resource ceilings | Strategic intent | Yes (Season) | Finance Council, People Council | 
| **Strategic Operations (SO)** | Convert intent into executable doctrine | Campaign Charters, doctrine | Continuous | Doctrine team, planners, logistics | 
| **Field Officers (FO)** | Enforce cadence, unblock teams, surface signals | Operational health | Pulse/Sprint-aligned | Embedded FO per Mission | 

**Defining trait:** Manage _alignment_. Cannot execute or scope.
* * *

#### 5. **Intelligence Units**

_"Detect, interpret, and inform."_

| Type | Authority | Output | Time-Aligned? | Examples | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Intelligence Hub (IH)** | Prioritise signals, escalate Priority-α | Decision briefs, strategic alerts | Continuous | Internal metrics, OSINT, competitor scans | 

**Defining trait:** Provide _situational awareness_. Cannot decide or act.
* * *

### III. Architectural Ruleset

| Rule | Enforcement | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **One structure, one purpose.** No unit mixes types. | Audited quarterly by SO. | 
| **Typed upstream/downstream mapping.** Every Execution Unit must tie to a Scope Unit. Every Scope Unit must tie to a Governance Unit. | Enforced via planning ledger. | 
| **Time anchoring is strict.** If the unit is time-aligned, it must comply with cadence checkpoints. No exceptions. | FO audit & doctrine compliance. | 
| **Support Units are pull-based only.** They cannot insert themselves into planning; only act on approved requests. | Logistics reviews all SD activity quarterly. | 
| **Intelligence is pre-decision only.** IH never back-rationalises or post-mortems--only informs _before_ action. | Doctrine lock on role boundaries. | 
* * *

This structural doctrine underpins every other element of your organisation.  
Projects are not execution units. Missions are not planning units. Field Officers are not managers. There is no ambiguity--only contract-bound structure.
