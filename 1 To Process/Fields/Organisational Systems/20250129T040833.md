Below is a **unified naming scheme** that retains the essence of the **Adaptive Command Matrix (ACM)** but uses a **cohesive, consistent set of terms** across all components. Each name has been chosen to reflect its core function while aligning with the broader mission-driven, decentralized philosophy of the ACM.

---

## **1. Strategy Council (SC)**

### **Replaces**  
- **Leadership Council** (the original top-level strategic body)

### **Role**  
- Defines and evolves the **company’s vision** and **long-term objectives**.  
- Oversees **major resource allocation** and ensures strategic alignment across the organization.  
- Serves as the **final authority** on large-scale decisions (expansions, acquisitions, etc.).

### **Naming Rationale**  
- **"Strategy"** indicates its focus on **long-term direction** and high-level goals.  
- **"Council"** emphasizes **collaborative leadership**, aligning with the ACM’s decentralized ethos.

---

## **2. Strategic Staff (SS)**

### **Replaces**  
- **Adaptive General Staff (AGS)**

### **Role**  
- Operates as the **planning and analytical brain trust** under the Strategy Council.  
- Develops **operational doctrine**, strategic scenarios, and advanced mission plans for large or complex initiatives.  
- Works closely with the **Intelligence Centre (IC)** to interpret data and formulate doctrine.

### **Naming Rationale**  
- **"Strategic"** underscores its focus on connecting the Strategy Council’s directives to operational realities.  
- **"Staff"** channels the classical “General Staff” notion but in a modern context, emphasizing meritocratic expertise.

---

## **3. Field Directors (FD)**

### **Replaces**  
- **Leadership Field Officers (LFOs)**

### **Role**  
- Bridge **strategic planning** (from the Strategy Council and Strategic Staff) with **frontline execution** (Mission Units).  
- Mentor **Mission Unit** leaders, resolve cross-functional challenges, and keep missions aligned with strategic objectives.  
- Circulate feedback and performance data upward to the **Strategic Staff** and **Strategy Council**.

### **Naming Rationale**  
- **"Field"** reflects their on-the-ground presence, supporting mission execution.  
- **"Directors"** conveys a role that both *guides* and *unblocks* operational teams without micromanaging.

---

## **4. Mission Units (MU)**

### **Replaces**  
- **Adaptive Mission Units (AMUs)**

### **Role**  
- **Time-bound teams** formed around specific missions, such as a product launch, market expansion, or process overhaul.  
- Disband once their objectives are met, ensuring organizational agility.  
- Receive **doctrinal guidance** from the Strategic Staff and direct support from Field Directors.

### **Naming Rationale**  
- **"Mission Units"** is concise yet descriptive: they are small units dedicated to a single mission.  
- Emphasizes the **purposeful**, **time-boxed** nature of their work.

---

## **5. Service Divisions (SD)**

### **Replaces**  
- **Operational Command Divisions (OCDs)**

### **Role**  
- Provide **continuous operational services** (Finance, HR, Legal, IT, Logistics, etc.) to the entire organization.  
- Support Mission Units by fulfilling **resource and infrastructure needs** on request.  
- Ensure operational stability while adapting processes to best practices from the **Strategic Staff**.

### **Naming Rationale**  
- **"Service"** clarifies that these divisions act as **internal providers**, aiding frontline execution.  
- **"Divisions"** signals a functional grouping rather than time-bound or mission-focused units.

---

## **6. Intelligence Centre (IC)**

### **Replaces**  
- **Intelligence Command Centre (ICC)**

### **Role**  
- Gathers and analyzes **market data**, **internal performance metrics**, and **competitive intelligence**.  
- Feeds insights to both **Strategic Staff** (for planning) and **Mission Units** (for real-time decisions).  
- Monitors **key indicators** that drive strategic pivots and mission adaptations.

### **Naming Rationale**  
- **"Intelligence Centre"** keeps it simple and clear: it’s a central hub for intelligence gathering and analysis.

---

## **7. Innovation Lab (IL)**

### **Replaces**  
- **Innovation Hub**

### **Role**  
- Manages **R&D**, **disruptive experiments**, and **exploratory projects**.  
- Hands off validated prototypes or ideas to **Mission Units** for scaling.  
- Collaborates with the **Strategic Staff** to anticipate upcoming market shifts and potential internal innovations.

### **Naming Rationale**  
- **"Lab"** denotes a **creative, experimental environment**, aligning with the advanced R&D function.

---

## **8. Optional Larger Structures for Extreme Scale**

When the organization has tens or hundreds of thousands of employees, you can add **nested tiers** under this naming system:

1. **Strategic Commands** (optional):
   - Group **Task Forces** under broad domains (e.g., a region, major product line).  
   - Led by **Command Directors** appointed by the **Strategy Council**.

2. **Operational Task Forces** (optional):
   - Oversee multiple **Mission Groups** and coordinate large, multi-phase endeavors.  
   - Led by **Field Directors** or **Strategic Staff** appointees with domain expertise.

3. **Mission Groups** (optional):
   - Collection of **Mission Units** working on related or complementary objectives.  
   - Led by a **Group Lead** who reports to the **Task Force** or **Strategic Command**.

These additional tiers can be introduced as the company grows, ensuring that **Mission Units** retain agility at the lowest levels while top-level strategy remains cohesive.

---

## **Summary of the Unified Naming Scheme**

1. **Strategy Council (SC)**  
   - Long-term vision, final strategic authority.

2. **Strategic Staff (SS)**  
   - Advanced planning, operational doctrines, big-picture coordination.

3. **Field Directors (FD)**  
   - Ground-level facilitators for **Mission Units**, ensuring alignment and support.

4. **Mission Units (MU)**  
   - Time-bound teams tackling specific objectives, the core execution engine.

5. **Service Divisions (SD)**  
   - Continuous operational support (HR, Finance, IT, Logistics, etc.) for the entire company.

6. **Intelligence Centre (IC)**  
   - Central hub for data-driven insights and competitive analysis.

7. **Innovation Lab (IL)**  
   - Experimental space for R&D, disruptive projects, and prototyping.

8. **[Optional at Extreme Scale]**: **Strategic Commands**, **Operational Task Forces**, **Mission Groups** for large-scale hierarchical grouping.

This **unified and coherent naming scheme** ensures each component’s **purpose** is instantly recognizable, preserving the **decentralized, adaptive** nature of the ACM while clearly describing responsibilities, dependencies, and relationships.
