*Correction: A more perspicuous query might have been, “Set forth a **unified, meritocratic governance lattice** that reconciles the Officer-Corps ladder, the Specialist & Innovation skill paths, and the assignment taxonomy—then dissect, one by one, the ‘institutions’ (organs) that keep this machine calibrated, educate its cadres, and enforce an up-or-out ethos.”*

## 1 / Officer Corps  

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Mandate** | Sustain a lineage of cross-mission commanders; export doctrine into the field; carry institutional memory. |
| **Grades** | O-0 Probationer (AMU Lead rotation) → O-1 Field Officer (LFO) → O-2 Senior Field (Task-Force) → O-3 Staff (AGS) → O-4 Senior Staff → O-5 Command → O-6 Councillor. |
| **Progression Law** | *Up-or-Out.* Two consecutive unsatisfactory tours trigger either reversion to Specialist track or exit. Minimum “time-in-grade,” mandatory command+staff alternation from O-2 upward. |
| **Metrics for Promotion** | ① Mission-Outcome Index, ② Leadership Climate (crew-NPS, attrition), ③ Doctrine Contribution Score. |
| **Doctrine** | Officers must publish at least one “Micro-Doctrine Dossier” per tour; adoption of two dossiers is prerequisite for promotion to O-3. |

---

## 2 / Specialist & Innovation Guilds  

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Mandate** | Cultivate deep craft excellence (data science, brand design, biotech, etc.) and edge-pushing research. |
| **Grades** | S-1 Junior, S-2 Practitioner, S-3 Principal, S-4 Distinguished Fellow. An Innovation Fellow (I-rank) is a Specialist on secondment to the Innovation Hub. |
| **Mobility Clause** | Specialists may *cross-commission* into O-0 after two successful AMU tours; conversely officers may sabbatical into S-ranks to refresh domain acuity (≤ 18 months). |
| **Up-or-Renew** | Every 36 months, a Specialist must either advance or produce a Guild-certified “Masterpiece Artifact” (patent, framework, major open-source library) to retain grade. |

---

## 3 / Talent Assignment Bureau (TAB)  

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Mandate** | Match human capital (internal & external) to missions, enforce assignment taxonomy, and preserve meritocratic equity. |
| **Mechanics** | Runs a continuously updated “Demand × Supply heat-map” powered by Mission Pipeline data ↔ People DB.  Uses linear-programming optimiser to minimise skill gaps, maximise career-progression credits. |
| **Authority** | Final arbitrator of who goes where; AMU Leaders may *request* talent but cannot unilaterally select beyond initial core. |
| **Transparency Tool** | Notion Dashboard exposes open billets; applicants (internal) bid quarterly for preferred tours, scored by TAB algorithm and board ratification. |

---

## 4 / Doctrine & Warfare Academy  

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Mandate** | Indoctrinate personnel in ACM culture, tactics, and ethics; certify readiness for officer or senior specialist progression. |
| **Curricula** | ① Mission-Command & Decentralised Control. ② Lean Hypothesis Craft. ③ Data-Weaponisation & Analytics. ④ Ethical Decision-Warfare. |
| **Pipelines** | • *Officer Cand. Course (OCC)*—6 weeks, gating to O-0.  • *Staff College*—10 weeks virtual + capstone, prerequisite to O-3.  • *Guild Masterclass*—12 week mixed cohort, prerequisite S-3→S-4. |
| **Faculty** | Mixed: Senior Staff Officers, Distinguished Specialists, external professors. |

---

## 5 / Board of Officers  

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Mandate** | Oversight of promotions, demotions, doctrine ratification, and up-or-out enforcement. |
| **Composition** | 5 voting members: two O-5, one O-4, one Distinguished Fellow (S-4), one LC delegate (O-6). |
| **Cadence** | Quarterly plenary; emergency ad-hoc for crisis demotions. Uses blind dossiers to mitigate bias. |

---

## 6 / Career Lattice Database  

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Mandate** | Single-source vector of every individual: grade, track, tours, KPI scores, dossiers authored, artifacts shipped. |
| **Tech** | Notion database with relation to Artifacts, Missions, Performance Logs; formulae compute *Promotion Eligibility Index* in real-time. |
| **Access** | Read-only to all employees (radical transparency); edit privilege restricted to TAB clerks. |

---

## 7 / Contractor Exchange  

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Mandate** | Curate external talent pool; standardise SOW templates; apply scored reputation to freelancers & partner-pods. |
| **Interface to TAB** | Contractors are presented as “E-class” nodes; algorithm treats them as fractional, non-promotable resources but still optimises fit. |
| **Quality Gates** | Every external completes Mission-End NPS; persistent sub-4.0/5 ≡ delisting. |

---

## 8 / Up-or-Out Implementation Logic  

1. **Time-Box:** every tour (mission for O-0/O-1; Task-Force for O-2; Staff posting for O-3) auto-generates a dossier in Career Lattice.  
2. **Scoring Window:** within 15 days of tour closure, ICC injects metrics; crew NPS & AAR quality auto-push.  
3. **Threshold Algorithm:**  
   ```
   Promotion_Eligible = (Outcome_Index ≥ 0.8) AND (Leadership_EQ ≥ 0.7)
   Renewal_Required   = (Outcome_Index 0.5–0.8)
   Up-or-Out_Flag     = (Outcome_Index < 0.5) OR (two consecutive Renewal_Required)
   ```
4. **Board of Officers** pronounces final verdict; TAB re-assigns or exits.  

---

## 9 / Cultural Codicil: “Company of Commanders”  

- **Doctrine of Positive Contention:** officers must openly critique mission briefs before sign-off; mandatory “Red-Team Table” at every AAR.  
- **Peer-Chosen Valour**: quarterly “Black-Pip” awarded by vote for exceptional initiative; bearer bypasses one promotion gate.  
- **Ethical Governor:** mis-alignment with ACM values overrides KPI success— ensures no “toxic superstar” advances.

### Epilogue  

By weaving **Officer Corps**, **Specialist & Innovation Guilds**, **Talent Assignment Bureau**, **Doctrine Academy**, **Board of Officers**, and the **Contractor Exchange** into a single relational lattice—instrumented by the **Career Lattice DB**—the enterprise achieves a **closed-loop meritocracy**: discovery → training → deployment → measurement → advancement or exit.  
This architecture fulfils your desideratum: *a company of A-players, commanders by craft, relentlessly culled and cultivated through transparent, data-driven rites of passage.*
