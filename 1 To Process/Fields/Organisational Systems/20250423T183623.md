*Correction → A more perspicuous formulation might have been:*  
> “Please delineate, with rigorous specificity, the canonical **assignment types** inside the Adaptive Command Matrix—i.e., how personnel, aides, advisers, and liaison staff are formally attached to AMUs, to higher-order bodies (Task Forces, Strategic Commands, Leadership Council, AGS), or to each other. I need unambiguous definitions, durations, and reporting lines.”

Below is a **taxonomy of assignments**—the contractual and functional bonds that tether individuals (or micro-teams) to the ACM’s structural nodes. Each assignment type is distinguished by **scope, permanence, authority gradient, and reporting cadence**.

| **Assignment Class** | **Canonical Purpose** | **Primary Beneficiary Node** | **Constituents & Archetypal Titles** | **Tenure Modality** | **Reporting Line** |
|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Core Membership** | Execute or govern the node’s raison d’être. | AMU, Mission Group, Task Force, Strategic Command, AGS Cell, Leadership Council. |  • AMU Leader, Engineers, Designers, Marketers.  • Task-Force Commander, Senior LFO.  • Chief Staff Officer (AGS).  • Council Member (CFO, CTO, CPO, etc.). | **Fixed to mission horizon** (AMU) or **indefinite** (OCD/LC). | Upward to immediate parent node (e.g., AMU→LFO; AGS→Council). |
| **Rotational Duty** | Inject fresh expertise; cross-pollinate doctrine; develop leadership bench. | Primarily AMUs; occasionally AGS cells. |  • Sprint-Phase Technical Lead.  • Rotating Scrum Master.  • Visiting Data Scientist. | 1–3 sprints (2–6 weeks) then rotates. | Dual: functional mentor + AMU Leader. |
| **Flash Attachment** | Rapid, ad-hoc intervention in crises or spikes. | AMU or OCD. |  • “Tiger-Team” SREs.  • Incident-Response Counsel. | ≤ 72 h (resolves incident). | AMU Leader (tactical) and LFO (post-mortem). |
| **Advisory Attachment** | Provide non-binding expert counsel, keep doctrinal coherence. | AMU, Task Force, Strategic Command. |  • Product Strategy Adviser.  • Growth Mentor (external).  • Regulatory Counsel (Legal OCD). | Episodic—invoked on demand; zero voting power. | Advises node head; dotted-line to AGS Doctrine Cell. |
| **Liaison (Inter-Node)** | Ensure bidirectional information flow between sibling nodes or external partners. | Between AMUs; between Company↔Partner. |  • Partner-Integration Liaison.  • Security Liaison Officer. | Mission-bounded or standing (for long alliances). | Dual to both node heads; escalation via AGS Ops Cell. |
| **Embedded Service** | Deliver continuous functional support inside a mission without full membership. | AMU, Mission Group. |  • DevOps Concierge (from IT-OCD).  • Finance Analyst (from Finance-OCD). | Borrowed 20–60 % time for mission duration. | Functional manager (OCD) ←→ AMU Leader. |
| **Secretariat / Executive Aide** | Administrative orchestration for high-leverage leaders. | Leadership Council, Strategic Command leaders. |  • Chief of Staff.  • Executive Assistant. | Indefinite, performance-renewed. | Solely to executive principal. |
| **Apprenticeship / Fellowship** | Skill acquisition through immersive shadowing. | AMU, AGS, LFO cohort. |  • Junior PM Fellow.  • AGS Staff-Officer Trainee. | 3–6 months rotational cycle. | Mentor within node; progress review by HR-OCD + LFO sponsor. |
| **Audit / Compliance Delegation** | Provide independent oversight, ensure fiduciary & legal conformity. | Strategic Command, OCD, High-risk AMU. |  • Internal Auditor.  • Data-Privacy Delegate. | Scheduled audits or milestone-based. | Functional independence—reports directly to Board or Compliance Chair. |

### **Key Clarifications**

1. **Core vs. Embedded**  
   *Core members* carry **decision rights** and are counted in the node’s quorum. *Embedded services* retain functional allegiance to their OCD but deliver on-site expertise.

2. **Rotational Duty vs. Flash Attachment**  
   - *Rotational* assignments are **pre-planned**, cadence-driven.  
   - *Flash* attachments are **reactive**, crisis-driven, and expire upon incident resolution.

3. **Adviser vs. Liaison**  
   - *Advisers* influence **content** (ideas, counsel).  
   - *Liaisons* influence **flow** (communication, alignment).

4. **Reporting Cadence**  
   - AMUs transmit **daily/weekly** stand-up artefacts to their LFO.  
   - Task Forces report **bi-weekly** to their Strategic Command.  
   - AGS Cells brief the Leadership Council on a **monthly** scenario cycle.

5. **Authority Gradient**  
   - Attachments (advisory, liaison, embedded) do **not** dilute the AMU Leader’s tactical sovereignty; they operate under **delegated authority** or **consultative privilege**.

### **Illustrative Micro-Case**

**Scenario:** An AMU (“Atlas-Cache”) must patch a zero-day exploit in <24 h.  
- *Flash Attachment*: Security SRE squad (3 engineers) arrives—full tactical obedience to AMU Leader.  
- *Advisory Attachment*: Legal Counsel provides data-breach disclosure guidance but has no executional authority.  
- *Liaison*: PR Liaison coordinates communications with external stakeholders, dual-reporting to AMU Leader and Corporate Comms OCD.  
- *Secretariat*: AMU Leader’s Chief-of-Staff triages inbound requests, schedules synchronous war-rooms, maintains log.  
Mission ends; Flash squad returns to Security OCD; logs and learnings transferred to AGS.

### **Doctrine for Assignment Selection**

Before attaching any role, apply the **“3-F Test”**:  

1. **Fit** – Does the task align with the assignee’s core competency?  
2. **Friction** – Will the attachment reduce or increase bureaucratic drag?  
3. **Fiscal Prudence** – Is the cost (time, budget, attention) proportionate to mission criticality?

If the triad passes, formalize the assignment; otherwise, redeploy lighter mechanisms (async advice, knowledge-base).

---

### **Final Synopsis**

An AMU’s integrity is preserved through **minimalist, precisely-scoped attachments**. Each assignment type—core, rotational, flash, advisory, liaison, embedded, secretariat, apprenticeship, audit—has:

- **Defined tenure**  
- **Explicit authority boundaries**  
- **Clear reporting conduits**

This **granular lattice of roles** allows the ACM to remain **both supple and disciplined**, ensuring the mission vehicle is never encumbered by superfluous passengers, yet always provisioned with the right expertise at the right moment.
