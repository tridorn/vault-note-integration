### *A Unified “Assignment Topology”*  
*(who can be attached to an AMU, in what capacity, and how that relates to a person’s long-term career path inside the ACM)*  

| Assignment Class | Short Code | Voting / Decision Power in the Mission | Typical Duration in AMU | Where the Person’s **“Home Path”** Usually Resides | Canonical Responsibilities |
|------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Core-Member** | **C** | ★★★★★ (full) | Entire mission | Any path (Specialist, Generalist, Leadership, etc.) | Build, deliver and be jointly accountable for the KRs. |
| **Mission-Lead** | **L** | ★★★★★ (full + tie-break) | Entire mission | Often Leadership or Senior-Specialist path | Own scope, rhythm, cadence, risk and narrative of the mission. |
| **Embedded Specialist** | **E** | ★★★★☆ | ≥ 30 % of duration | Deep-Specialist path (e.g., AI scientist) | Provide scarce domain skill; pair with core engineering or design. |
| **Leadership-Field-Officer** | **F** | ★★★☆☆ (facilitative) | From kick-off to closing review | LFO path (leadership-development track) | Coach, de-block, escalate; never micro-manage. |
| **AGS Liaison / Staff-Officer** | **S** | ★★★☆☆ (oversight) | From scoping to first retros | AGS path | Ensure doctrine compliance, capture learning, synchronise missions. |
| **OCD Support Node** | **O** | ★★☆☆☆ (service) | As-needed bursts | Finance, HR, IT, Legal, etc. | Supply budget, contracts, infra, compliance artefacts. |
| **External Contracted Contributor** | **X** | Variable, contract-defined | Fixed work-package | Outside legal entity | Bring in speed or scarce skill; managed by the AMU Lead. |
| **Observer / Trainee** | **T** | 0 (no vote) | Few days–weeks | Graduate pipeline, leadership pipeline | Shadow, learn, harvest patterns for future missions. |

### 1. Two Orthogonal Axes  
**a. Career / Role Path** ― a *long-lived* ladder (e.g., Specialist, LFO, AGS, Operational).  
**b. Mission Assignment Class** ― a *temporary* status inside a specific AMU (table above).  
> *At any given moment a person can say:*  
> **“I am in the* Specialist Path *and currently hold an* E-assignment *inside AMU-47.”***

### 2. Assignment Rules

1. **Every AMU must list C (core) and at least one L (lead)** in the charter.  
2. **Maximum ratio** of non-core (E + X + T + O + S + F) to core is **1 : 1** to avoid “mission bloat.”  
3. **Voting rights** only granted to C and L; others advise or facilitate.  
4. **Externals (X)** always work through an internal C or L counterpart; they never hold L.  
5. **F and S** cannot overrule the Lead on tactical choices; they raise alarms to AGS if doctrine or ethics are breached.  
6. **Observers (T)** never outnumber Core to preserve psychological safety.

### 3. Lifecycle Touch-Points  

| Moment | Artefact | Who Signs / Updates |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Mission Charter** | Roster with assignment codes, budget envelope, KR list. | Lead (L) + LFO (F) + AGS Staff (S). |
| **Sprint Kick-off** | Capacity sheet (C/E/X hours) | Lead (L). |
| **Mid-Mission Sync** | Risk & Learning log | Lead + F + S. |
| **Post-Mortem** | Lessons + Talent-release form | Lead + F; S archives into doctrine repo. |

### 4. Illustrative Micro-Scenario  

> **Mission:** “Ship iOS dark-mode prototype in 10 days.”  
> **Roster:**  
> • 1 Lead (L) – senior mobile engineer  
> • 3 Core (C) – UI dev, UX designer, QA  
> • 1 Embedded (E) – accessibility specialist (20 h)  
> • 1 LFO (F) – rotating coach  
> • 1 OCD-IT (O) – build-pipeline guru (4 h)  

Total voting bodies = 1 L + 3 C = 4. Non-core bodies (E+F+O)=3 → ratio 3 : 4 – within limits. Mission closes; charter archived; members released back to path pools.

### 5. Why This Matters

* A **shared lexicon** (C-L-E-F-S-O-X-T) ends confusion about “who’s really on the team.”  
* **Path stays stable** (how you grow); **assignment stays fluid** (where you help).  
* **Governance clarity**: investors, HR, and legal instantly know liability, IP ownership, and pay-grade duties by reading the roster.

This unified topology keeps AMUs lightweight yet formally sound, allowing them to spin up or down in minutes—even under extreme uncertainty—without collapsing accountability, authority, or learning capture.
