In a company structured around the **Adaptive Mission Unit (AMU)** system, strategic planning, goal setting, and operational execution are layered, with different levels of the organization responsible for defining and driving various aspects of the company’s strategy. To ensure clarity, we will use **consistent terminology** across the different levels of the organization. The key terms that define objectives and goals will be **Vision**, **Objectives**, **Key Results (KR)**, **Missions**, **Tasks**, and **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**. Each level has a distinct responsibility for setting these, ensuring that the company's long-term vision is translated into actionable and measurable results.

Here's a breakdown of what gets set at each level and the specific terminology:

---

### **1. Leadership Council: Strategic Vision and High-Level Objectives**

The **Leadership Council** is responsible for the **long-term direction** of the company, defining the highest-level strategic ambitions. Their role is to provide **clarity of vision**, set broad **objectives** that will guide the entire organization, and define key **metrics of success** for these objectives.

#### **At The Leadership Council Level:**

- **Vision**:
  - This is the **long-term, aspirational direction** of the company. It answers the question: "What do we want the company to become in the future?"
  - The Vision is typically broad, addressing market positioning, industry influence, or innovation leadership.
  
  **Example**: "Become the leading AI-powered customer service solution in Europe within 5 years."

- **Objectives**:
  - **Objectives** are the **strategic goals** that align with the company’s vision. They are the big-picture goals that need to be achieved for the company to move toward its Vision. They are ambitious but focused and drive company-wide priorities.
  - Objectives are typically set annually or quarterly, providing a **strategic focus** for the organization.

  **Example**: "Expand into the European market by introducing our AI product."

- **Key Results (KRs)**:
  - **Key Results** are the specific, measurable indicators of success for each Objective. They answer the question: "How do we know if we're achieving our objective?"
  - KRs are quantitative and allow the Leadership Council to track progress toward their strategic objectives.

  **Example**: 
  - Generate €10 million in revenue from the European market within 18 months.
  - Establish partnerships with five leading European distributors within 12 months.

- **Strategic KPIs**:
  - **Strategic KPIs** track ongoing performance toward the broader vision and objectives. These are more granular metrics used to measure company performance across longer timeframes (quarterly, annually) and may include financial growth, market share, product adoption rates, etc.

  **Example**: 
  - Total revenue growth.
  - Market share in new markets.
  - Customer retention rates.

### **2. Leadership Field Officers (LFOs): Translating Objectives into Missions**

The **Leadership Field Officers (LFOs)** take the high-level Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) defined by the Leadership Council and **translate them into actionable Missions** for the AMUs. They work on creating a **bridge** between strategy and execution by ensuring the **operationalization** of the strategy.

#### **At The LFO Level:**

- **Mission Objectives**:
  - The **Mission Objectives** break down the high-level **Objectives** set by the Leadership Council into more **specific, time-bound goals** that can be achieved through operational work. These objectives are actionable and focus on what needs to be done to achieve the broader goals.

  **Example**: "Conduct market research in Europe to identify high-potential customer segments and competitors."

- **Key Results (KRs) for Missions**:
  - Similar to the Council’s KRs, but now adapted to specific missions. These are measurable indicators tied to the Mission Objectives that LFOs assign to AMUs. They are precise and more focused than the high-level KRs.

  **Example**: 
  - Identify three target customer segments within 3 months.
  - Complete a competitive analysis of five top competitors in the market.

- **Resource Allocation and Tactical KPIs**:
  - LFOs also set **Tactical KPIs**, which measure specific operational effectiveness or resource use. These Tactical KPIs help monitor whether AMUs are efficiently using their allocated resources (people, time, money) to meet the mission objectives.

  **Example**: 
  - Budget adherence for the mission.
  - Time spent on critical tasks versus auxiliary tasks.

### **3. AMU Leaders: Executing Missions**

The **AMU Leaders** are responsible for **executing the Missions** assigned by the LFOs. They translate **Mission Objectives** into concrete actions, organizing their teams into sprints, allocating resources, and breaking down tasks for execution. Their focus is on **operational efficiency** and **achieving the Mission’s Key Results**.

#### **At The AMU Level:**

- **Mission Objectives** (Same as set by LFOs):
  - The AMU Leaders receive **Mission Objectives** directly from LFOs. These objectives give AMU teams a **clear target** for what needs to be achieved within the scope of their mission.

  **Example**: "Localize the AI product for European regulatory compliance and customer preferences."

- **Key Results (KRs)**:
  - The KRs given by the LFOs are further broken down into **sub-KRs** or deliverables that the AMU can manage. These sub-KRs focus on immediate, **team-level outputs** necessary to fulfill the broader mission KRs.
  
  **Example**: 
  - Ensure product compliance with EU data privacy regulations.
  - Complete product translation into three languages within 3 months.

- **Tasks and Deliverables**:
  - AMU Leaders take the **KRs** and break them down into **specific tasks and deliverables** that the team can execute within shorter sprint cycles. These tasks ensure that the mission’s goals are achievable in a structured, time-efficient manner.

  **Example**: 
  - Task 1: Assign legal team to review EU data compliance requirements.
  - Task 2: Work with translation vendors to translate product UI into German, French, and Spanish.

- **Operational KPIs**:
  - Operational KPIs track the **day-to-day progress** of the AMU. These KPIs measure short-term success and ensure that the team is meeting deadlines and maintaining productivity levels.

  **Example**: 
  - Sprint completion rate.
  - Number of customer feedback loops completed per sprint.

### **4. Team Members: Executing Tasks and Reporting Progress**

The **team members** within each AMU are responsible for **completing the specific tasks and deliverables** assigned to them by the AMU Leader. Their focus is on **task-level execution** and ensuring that they are making steady progress toward the **Key Results** defined at the AMU level.

#### **At The Team Member Level:**

- **Tasks**:
  - These are the **specific actions** that each team member must take to contribute to the mission’s success. Tasks are often aligned with their specific area of expertise, whether it's product development, marketing, or customer research.

  **Example**: "Translate the AI product interface into German by the end of Sprint 2."

- **Task-Specific KPIs**:
  - Task-specific KPIs track the immediate, granular progress of individual tasks. These can include time to complete a task, the accuracy of work, or the number of iterations required before final approval.

  **Example**: 
  - Task completion within allocated time.
  - Translation accuracy verified by QA team.

### **5. Continuous Feedback and Alignment Across Levels**

To ensure that all levels are aligned and that the **Leadership Council’s high-level strategy** is consistently driving the operational execution, there are continuous feedback mechanisms:

#### **Feedback Loops**

- **Leadership Council to LFOs**: The Council provides regular updates on whether the **high-level strategic objectives** are on track based on the company’s overall performance and market conditions.
- **LFOs to AMUs**: LFOs ensure that AMU Leaders understand their **Mission Objectives** and are properly equipped to achieve their **Key Results**. Regular check-ins happen to ensure that AMUs remain aligned with company priorities.
- **AMUs to LFOs**: AMUs report their progress based on the **Mission’s Key Results and Tactical KPIs**. If they encounter roadblocks, the LFOs provide guidance or adjust mission parameters.
- **AMU Teams**: Team members report task progress during **sprint reviews**, allowing AMU Leaders to monitor performance and adjust the team's focus as needed.

#### **Alignment Tools**

- **OKR Tracking Systems**: Tools like **OKR software (e.g., WorkBoard, Weekdone, or Ally)** are used to track Objectives and Key Results across different levels of the company. This ensures that all team members can see how their work ties into the company's overall strategy.
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: **Dashboards** provide visibility into **KPIs** at all levels, from strategic KPIs set by the Leadership Council to operational KPIs tracking day-to-day AMU progress.

### **Conclusion: Consistent Terminology for Goals and Execution**

To summarize, the company operates with a structured, tiered approach to strategy and execution, using consistent terminology:

- **Leadership Council**: Defines the **Vision**, **Objectives**, **Key Results (KRs)**, and **Strategic KPIs** for long-term goals.
- **LFOs**: Translate these into **Mission Objectives**, **Mission KRs**, and set **Tactical KPIs** for execution.
- **AMU Leaders**: Operationalize the **Missions** into **Tasks**,

 **Deliverables**, and manage **Operational KPIs** to track immediate progress.
- **Team Members**: Execute the **Tasks** based on the specific objectives assigned to them, with a focus on achieving the **Key Results**.

This layered approach ensures that the company’s **strategic vision** is continuously being translated into **tangible, actionable work** that teams at every level can contribute to.
