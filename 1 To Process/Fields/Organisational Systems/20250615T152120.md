You might have phrased your request more strategically: _"Please elaborate Section II--the Temporal Framework--of the documentation kernel."_

* * *

## II. Temporal Framework

### 1. Cadence Hierarchy

_Durations are fixed; start / end dates align to ISO-8601 calendar weeks unless explicitly overridden by Strategic Operations._

| Cadence Unit | Code Prefix | Standard Duration | Primary Owner | Non-negotiable Outcome | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Pulse** | P | 1 working day | Cell Lead | Status checkpoint + blocker register | 
| **Sprint** | S | 10 working days | Mission Commander | Incremental deliverable + retro notes | 
| **Mission** | M | 6--12 weeks (≈3--6 Sprints) | Mission Commander | Objective met or formally rolled forward | 
| **Program** | G | 26 weeks (2 Missions) | Program Director | KPI delta validated + next Program chartered | 
| **Campaign** | C | 52 weeks (2 Programs) | Campaign Sponsor | Strategic milestone achieved or aborted | 
| **Season** | Y | 52 weeks (fiscal) | Strategic Council | Portfolio review + doctrinal adjustments | 

_Rule:_ if a unit misses its end date, it auto-extends **once** (≤ 25 %) before mandatory escalation to the next governance tier.
* * *

### 2. Rhythmic Governance Points

| Cadence | Event | Timebox | Mandatory Attendees | Key Artefact Produced | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Pulse | Daily Review | 15 min | Cell Lead + FO | Blocker Log | 
| Sprint | Review & Retro | 2 h | Mission Team + FO | Sprint Report | 
| Mission | Mid-Point Health Check | ½ day | Mission Cmdr + Program Dir | Mission Scorecard | 
| Program | Monthly Steering | 2 h | Program Dir + Campaign Sponsor | Program Dashboard | 
| Campaign | Quarterly Portfolio Review | ½ day | Council, SO, Sponsors | Campaign Scorecard | 
| Season | Annual Strategic Reset | 2 days | Council + SO Chiefs | Updated Doctrine & Capital Allocation | 

Governance events are immovable anchors; operational work flexes around them.

* * *

### 3. Linking Cadence to Structural Units

- **Pulse ↔ Cell:** Daily operational synch; FO verifies cross-cell dependencies.
- **Sprint ↔ Mission:** Sprint backlog derived from Mission Order; FO signs off on retro compliance.
- **Mission ↔ Project:** Each Mission maps to exactly one _active_ Project scope segment; no orphaned Missions.
- **Program ↔ Task Force:** Task Forces shepherd Programs, ensuring synergy among sibling Projects.
- **Campaign ↔ Strategic Command:** Campaign Sponsors report to SO; Council ratifies pivot or termination decisions.
- **Season ↔ Portfolio:** Portfolio health metrics roll up to Council; informs capital strategy.
* * *

### 4. Temporal Identifiers

`YY.Cxx.Gyy.Mzz.Saa.Pbb`

- **YY** = Fiscal Year
- **Cxx** = Campaign number within year
- **Gyy** = Program index inside Campaign
- **Mzz** = Mission sequence
- **Saa** = Sprint count within Mission
- **Pbb** = Pulse day (optional; used for forensic tracking)

Example: `25.C03.G02.M05.S04` → _Season 2025, Campaign 3, Program 2, Mission 5, Sprint 4._

* * *

### 5. Cadence Invariants

1. **No nested overlaps:** A unit may not start a new Sprint until the previous Sprint is formally closed.

2. **Single governance path:** Escalations track cadence layers; bypass only for existential threats.

3. **Fixed review density:** Each Mission guarantees ≥ 1 review event per 10 working days.

4. **Clock ownership cannot be delegated:** If a Mission Commander is absent, a formally appointed deputy assumes cadence responsibility--never the Field Officer.
* * *

This Temporal Framework constitutes the metronome of the organisation: immutable durations, mandated governance checkpoints, and precise code identities. All operational and strategic processes compile against this clock; deviation is an explicit exception, never silent drift.
