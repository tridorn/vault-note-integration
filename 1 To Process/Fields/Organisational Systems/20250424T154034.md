*Correction: an unambiguous phrasing could have been:*  
> “Please synthesise — into one exhaustive précis — all current refinements of the Adaptive Command Matrix (ACM): structural strata, officer-corps meritocracy, assignment classes, skill paths, artefact lattice, and the scaling logic from solo founder to multi-entity alliance.”

---

## **I. Ontological Premise**

The **Adaptive Command Matrix** is a **layered, meritocratic, mission-centric operating doctrine** whose raison d’être is to reconcile uncompromising agility with doctrinal coherence.  
It is constructed from five inter-meshing lattices:

1. **Structural Hierarchy** (nests nodes: AMU → Mission Group → Task Force → Strategic Command → Leadership Council).  
2. **Officer Corps** (a graded command craft ladder: O-0 to O-6).  
3. **Assignment Classes** (core, rotational, flash, advisory, liaison, embedded contractor, fractional specialist, partner-AMU, etc.).  
4. **Skill-Path Constellations** (Specialist, Innovationist, Officer — with bidirectional oscillation).  
5. **Artefact Graph** (Vision Charter down to Sprint Backlogs, all cross-relational in a Notion SSoT).

These lattices interlock to form a single **adaptive organism** rather than disparate mechanisms.

## **II. Structural Hierarchy (Node Stack)**

| Tier | Primary Node | Command Span | Typical Duration | Canonical Artefacts |
|------|--------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **0** | **AMU** (Adaptive Mission Unit) | 5-12 people | 1-12 weeks | Mission Charter, Sprint Backlog, Mission Log, AAR |
| **1** | **Mission Group** | 2-10 AMUs | 4-16 weeks | Group-Brief, Resource Grid |
| **2** | **Task Force** | Several Groups | 3-18 months | TF Ops Plan, P&L Dashboard |
| **3** | **Strategic Command** | Domain/Region | Multi-year | Command Plan, Risk Portfolio |
| **4** | **Leadership Council** | Whole org | Indefinite | Vision Charter, Strategic Objectives Map |
| *Cross-cutting* | **AGS Cells / OCD Divisions / ICC / Innovation Hub** | Planning, backbone, intelligence, R&D | Continuous | Doctrine Library, Resource Map, Intelligence Dashboards |

---

## **III. Officer-Corps Meritocracy**

| Grade | Title | Typical Billet | Promotion Gate | Exit Consequence (up-or-out) |
|-------|-------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **O-0** | Probationer | Rotational AMU Leader | 2 mission successes + peer score | Return to Specialist path |
| **O-1** | Field Officer (LFO) | Mission-Group LFO / Strike-AMU lead | Doctrine exam + Field Board | Relegation to O-0 |
| **O-2** | Senior Field Officer | Task-Force Commander | Profitable TF + 360 review | Relegation to O-1 |
| **O-3** | Staff Officer | AGS Cell Lead | Published doctrine adopted org-wide | Relegation to O-2 |
| **O-4** | Senior Staff Officer | Chief of AGS Cell / SC XO | Board of Officers vote | Relegation to O-3 |
| **O-5** | Command Officer | Strategic-Command Lead | LC ratification | Exit to external board/advisory |
| **O-6** | Councillor | Leadership Council seat | Extraordinary LC vote | — |

Officers retain their **commission** when moving between Field (execution) and Staff (doctrine), ensuring continuity of command craft.

---

## **IV. Assignment Classes (Attachment Grammar)**

| Class | Source | Span | Key Use-case |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|
| Core Membership | Internal FTE | Mission / node life | Primary execution |
| Rotational Duty | Internal | 1-3 sprints | Leadership seasoning |
| Flash Attachment | Internal | ≤ 72 h | Crisis fix |
| Advisory | Int./Ext. | Episodic | Expert counsel |
| Liaison | Int./Ext. | As-needed | Info symmetry |
| **Embedded Contractor** | External freelancer | Mission | Skill gap |
| **Fractional Specialist** | External exec | Retainer | CFO/DPO on demand |
| **Partner-AMU** | Vendor pod | Milestone | Outsourced sub-mission |

Assignments are controlled by the **AGS Resource Gate** and tracked in a Notion “Roster” database.

---

## **V. Skill-Path Constellations**

1. **Specialist Track** – deep functional mastery; may cross-commission into O-series.  
2. **Innovationist Track** – incubation & R&D; rotates through Innovation Hub AMUs.  
3. **Officer Track** – command craft; up-or-out between O-grades, feeding LC and AGS.

Oscillation is permitted under a *Career Oscillation Charter* (max two oscillations per triennium) to prevent career whiplash yet foster cross-pollination.

---

## **VI. Artefact Graph (SSoT in Notion)**

| Layer | Exemplary Artefacts | Frequency |
|-------|--------------------|-----------|
| Strategic | Vision Charter, Resource-Allocation Framework, Master Risk Register | Annual / Quarterly |
| Planning | Mission Blueprint, Operational Doctrine, Scenario Playbooks | Pre-mission / Continuous |
| Execution | Mission Charter, Sprint Backlog, Mission Log, AAR | Daily / Sprint / Post-mission |
| Intelligence | Market Dash, Ops KPI Dash, Predictive Models | Real-time / Weekly |
| Backbone | Finance Ledger, HR Registry, Compliance Vault | Continuous |

Every artefact is a row or sub-page related upward; roll-ups feed dashboards that power decision loops.

---

## **VII. Operating Cadence**

1. **Leadership Council** sets quarterly OKRs.  
2. **AGS** decomposes into Mission Blueprints → populates the **Mission Pipeline**.  
3. AMUs execute in 1-2 week sprints; LFOs coach, capture emergent ideas, report blockers.  
4. **ICC** streams metrics; AGS iterates doctrine in real-time.  
5. Post-mission AARs feed Officer promotion dossiers and doctrine updates.  
6. Up-or-out boards convene quarterly to advance or release officers, ensuring only **A-players** ascend.

---

## **VIII. Scaling Logic**

- **Solo Founder → Phase-I**: founder is LC+AGS, micro-AMUs of one.  
- **10-Head Count**: first probationer officers, embryonic OCD.  
- **30+**: full Officer lattice (O-0→O-2), formal AGS Cells, Intelligence dashboard.  
- **100+**: Strategic Commands stand-up, Partner-AMUs integrated.  
- **Multi-Entity Alliance**: Alliance Council + Joint AGS overlay; Partner-AMUs proliferate.

---

## **IX. Cultural Engine**

*“Company of Commanders.”*  
Culture reinforced through:  

- **Officer Academy** (6-week doctrine boot-camp).  
- **Esprit-de-corps insignia** (Notion icons + lapel pins).  
- **Doctrine Hackathons** (quarterly).  
- **Up-or-Out Purity** (no safe sinecures).

---

## **X. Synthesis**

The present design fuses *structure* (node stack), *talent meritocracy* (Officer Corps), *fluid attachments* (assignment classes), *domain mastery* (skill paths), and *institutional memory* (artefact graph) into a **single mechanistic ecology**.  
The result is an enterprise capable of **ferocious execution** and **perpetual self-renewal**, wherein only those who repeatedly deliver, learn, and refine the doctrine ascend—precisely the architecture required for a *venture engine of A-players and commanders*.
