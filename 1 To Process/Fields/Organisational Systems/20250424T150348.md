**ACM PERSONNEL GRID – three orthogonal layers that never overlap**

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ HORIZONTAL   │  x  │ VERTICAL  │ +  │ ASSIGNMENT  │   =  “WHO this person IS,
│ (Domain)     │     │ (Rank)    │     │ (Context)   │      HOW much authority,
└──────────────┘     └───────────┘     └─────────────┘      WHERE they are now”
```

A *single* individual simultaneously holds **one Domain / level**, **one Rank**, and **one live Assignment**.  
Nothing else.  No shadow ladders, no title creep.

---

## Ⅰ HORIZONTAL – DOMAIN TRACK  
*What the person is objectively good at* (core craft), graded D-0 … D-5  
*(entry level is validated by portfolio / references; lateral hires can slot in high)*

| Code | Proficiency label | Observable proof points |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **D-0** | Trainee | Boot-camp, internship, no solo output |
| **D-1** | Associate | Ships tasks autonomously, mentored peer reviews |
| **D-2** | Practitioner | Reliably owns features / campaigns end-to-end |
| **D-3** | Senior Practitioner | Mentors others, optimises process, publishes playbooks |
| **D-4** | Expert | Org-wide reference, drives cross-team standards |
| **D-5** | Master | External thought-leader, invents new paradigms |

**Pre-defined domains** (add more as needed, never merge):  

`Product` · `Engineering` · `Design` · `Marketing/Growth` · `Sales/BD` ·  
`Operations/SCM` · `Finance` · `People` · `Legal/Compliance` · `Data & Research` ·  
`Strategy/Planning` · `Venture-Building / Innovation`

---

## Ⅱ VERTICAL – AUTHORITY RANK  
*How much decision power & span they are trusted with* (universal lattice R-0 … R-7)

| Rank | Canonical billet scope | Typical node commanded | Vote in budgets? |
|------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **R-0  Apprentice** | learning only | — | ✕ |
| **R-1  Specialist / IC** | single work-stream | Task card | ✕ |
| **R-2  Team Lead** | ≤ 15 people | **AMU Leader** | ✕ |
| **R-3  Field Officer** | multiple AMUs / Mission Group | **LFO** | △ (local) |
| **R-4  Task-Force Cmdr.** | 30–60 ppl / 1 budget | Task-Force | ✓ |
| **R-5  Staff Officer / Dir.** | AGS Cell / OCD division | Domain P&L | ✓ |
| **R-6  Command Officer** | Strategic Command / Business unit | Full P&L | ✓✓ |
| **R-7  Councillor** | Whole enterprise | Leadership Council | ✓✓✓ |

*R-2 and above are considered “commissioned officers” and enter the Officer Corps mile-stone promotions.*

---

## Ⅲ ASSIGNMENT CLASS – CONTEXT  
*Where the person currently operates.*  Exactly **one** live assignment at a time.

| Code | What it means | Tenure default | Voting inside node |
|------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **CMD** | **Node Commander** (AMU-Lead, Task-Force Cmdr., etc.) | = node lifespan | Full |
| **CORE** | Core member of the node | = node lifespan | Full |
| **STAFF** | AGS / OCD staff support | Rolling 6 – 12 mo | Advisory |
| **EMB** | Embedded specialist borrowed from a home team | 2 – 8 wks | Limited |
| **CONS** | External contractor / freelancer | SoW / milestone | None |
| **FRAC** | Fractional executive (retainer) | day-rate cadence | Advisory |
| **LIAS** | Liaison between two nodes / partners | mission-bound | Procedural |
| **ADV** | Adviser / Mentor | on-call | None |
| **AUD** | Compliance / Audit delegate | episodic | Oversight |
| **RESV** | In talent bench, awaiting next posting | max 30 d | — |

Assignments are stored in one `Assignments` database; when the status flips to “Complete” the person moves to **RESV** until re-deployed.

## Ⅳ PROMOTION & FLOWS

```
Domain progression   : evidence-based skill mastery → D-level up
Rank progression     : Board-of-Officers review  → R-level up  (up-or-out rule)
Assignment rotation  : AGS Resource cell  → new CMD / CORE / etc.
```

*Example candidate timeline*

```
join as Jr. Growth Marketer      D-1 / R-1  CORE (AMU-Growth-Hack)
↑ delivers 2 high-impact sprints
promoted to AMU-Lead             D-2 / R-2  CMD  (AMU-Referral-Engine)
↑ two missions, strong AARs
earns Field-Officer commission   D-3 / R-3  STAFF→LFO  (Mission Group “Acq.”)
```

## Ⅴ WHY IT NOW FITS  (no overlaps, no gaps)

| Axis | Mutually exclusive? | Exhaustive? | Drives meritocracy? |
|------|--------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Domain | 1 at a time, but levelled | Covers every craft | Skill proofs, peer review |
| Rank   | 1 universal ladder | Everyone slotted | Up-or-out, scope KPIs |
| Assignment | 1 live posting | Every work context | Output tracked, fast rotation |

The three axes **multiply** into a precise coordinate (e.g., *“D-3 Marketing × R-4 Cmd × CMD”*) that instantly tells you **what** the person is great at, **how much power** they wield, and **where** they’re deployed—crisp, scalable, and impossible to game.

That is the ACM merit architecture, weaponised for A-players and continual upward pressure.
