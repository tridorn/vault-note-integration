# **üöÄ Step-by-Step Guide to Start Trading Futures**

---

### **1. Choose the Right Futures Broker and Account Type**
**Recommended Brokers:**
- **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)**: Best for beginners and experienced traders due to low commissions and access to micro contracts.
- **AMP Futures**: Offers flexibility, low margin requirements, and support for day trading micros.

**Account Type:**  
- **Cash Account:** For low leverage and less risk (recommended for beginners).  
- **Margin Account:** Needed if you plan to hold leveraged positions overnight.  

*üéØ **Step:** Open your account and link it to your trading platform (e.g., NinjaTrader or TradingView for analysis, TWS for execution).*

---

### **2. Start with Micro Contracts to Manage Risk**
**Why Micros Are Ideal:**  
- They have **1/10th the size of regular contracts**, making them suitable for small accounts while allowing you to learn without large losses.

**Recommended Micro Futures to Start:**
| **Market**              | **Symbol** | **Why It‚Äôs Suitable**                                      |
|------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Micro E-mini S&P 500**| MES        | High liquidity, tracks the S&P 500, ideal for index trading. |
| **Micro E-mini Nasdaq** | MNQ        | Higher volatility, tech-driven, good for breakout strategies. |
| **Micro Gold**          | MGC        | Safe-haven asset, often inversely correlated to indices.   |

---

### **3. Basic Strategy: Intraday VWAP + EMA Pullback**
To jump into trading quickly without overcomplicating things, **use a simple yet effective momentum strategy.** This strategy will help you focus on **high-probability setups** with limited risk.

#### **Setup Requirements:**
- **Timeframe:** 5-minute or 15-minute chart
- **Indicators:**  
  - **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price):** Measures intraday price direction and ‚Äúfair value.‚Äù  
  - **20-EMA (Exponential Moving Average):** Filters trades by short-term trend.  
  - **RSI (14-period):** Helps avoid entering overbought or oversold trades.

---

#### **Entry Criteria (Long Trades):**
1. Price is **above VWAP**, indicating bullish momentum.  
2. The market pulls back to or near the **20-EMA**, without closing below it.  
3. RSI is not overbought (below 70).  
4. Enter when the next candle closes **above the 20-EMA**, confirming the resumption of the trend.

---

#### **Exit Criteria:**
- **Profit Target:** Use a 2:1 risk/reward ratio or nearby resistance.  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place the stop below the most recent swing low.

**Example:**  
- You enter a long trade at **4305** on MES when it bounces off the 20-EMA.  
- Set your stop-loss at **4300** (below recent low).  
- Target profit = 10 points above entry (4315).

---

### **4. Position Sizing: Apply the 1-2% Rule**
To protect your capital, follow the **1-2% rule**: Never risk more than 1-2% of your total account per trade.

**Example Calculation:**  
- Starting capital: ‚Ç¨5,000  
- Risk per trade: 1% (‚Ç¨50)  
- If MES moves 1 point = $5 (~‚Ç¨4.50), then:  
  - **Stop-loss distance:** 10 points = ‚Ç¨45 risk  
  - Trade size: 1 contract (fits within the ‚Ç¨50 risk limit)

*üéØ **Step:** Use this formula to size your trades and avoid overleveraging.*

---

### **5. Execute Your First Trade**
- Analyze market conditions during the U.S. market open (15:30 CET).  
- Watch for setups that meet your criteria (VWAP pullback to EMA).  
- Use **limit orders** to control your entry price.  
- Place a **bracket order** (automatically sets stop-loss and take-profit levels).

---

### **6. Monitor and Adjust**
- Use **trailing stops** to lock in profits as the market moves in your favor.  
- Avoid overtrading‚Äîstick to **3-5 trades per session** to maintain focus.  
- Take breaks to avoid fatigue during long sessions.

---

### **7. End-of-Day Review**
- Log each trade in a journal (e.g., Edgewonk, Notion, or Excel):  
  - Entry/exit prices, reason for the trade, outcome, and lessons learned.  
- Review trades to identify patterns of success or mistakes.  
- Adjust your strategy as needed based on weekly performance.

### **8. Manage Your Learning Process**
1. **Backtest Regularly:** Use TradingView‚Äôs replay function to test the strategy on historical data.  
2. **Demo Trade First:** Before going live, **practice with paper trading** for at least 1-2 weeks to fine-tune execution.  
3. **Set Risk Limits:** Establish daily and weekly maximum drawdowns (e.g., 5% per day or 10% per week).

---

### **9. Transition to Live Trading**
Once you achieve **3 consecutive weeks of break-even or profitable paper trading**, you can transition to live trading with **micro contracts**.

**Starting Recommendation:**  
- Start with 1 micro contract (MES or MNQ) and **scale up** only when consistent.  
- Monitor **psychological differences**‚Äîlive trading may trigger emotional reactions like fear or greed.  
- **Don‚Äôt scale too fast:** Ensure you‚Äôre consistently profitable before moving to larger contracts.
