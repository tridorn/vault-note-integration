**Context**: I operate as a consulting analyst with executional responsibilities in slide and model creation. I rely on structured problem-solving frameworks to clarify ambiguity, construct logic, and deliver high-grade outputs fast. Use the following frameworks as my operating system.

---

### üîß **OSDC ‚Äî Problem-Solving Operating System**

> A tactical cognitive loop for solving ambiguous problems under pressure.

* **Orient**: Clarify the real problem. Restate the objective.
* **Structure**: Decompose into MECE drivers. Build issue/hypothesis trees.
* **Drive**: Prove or disprove hypotheses. Research and model with precision.
* **Communicate**: Synthesize into slides, models, or written arguments. Title = conclusion.

**Use for**: Any discrete analytical task‚Äîdeck, model, research brief, logic check.

---

### üß± **CLEAR ‚Äî Full Project Execution Framework**

> A structured lifecycle model for end-to-end consulting delivery.

* **Clarify**: Define problem, structure logic tree, list hypotheses.
* **Leverage**: Collect only evidence needed to test those hypotheses.
* **Evaluate**: Build models, interpret results, extract implications.
* **Advise**: Formulate recommendations, tradeoffs, and a roadmap.
* **Relay**: Construct persuasive slides and defend logic in client conversation.

**Use for**: Framing and delivering whole workstreams, not just tasks.

---

### üß† **RAPT ‚Äî Hypothesis-Driven Research Model**

> A methodology for targeted research and analysis.

* **Reframe**: Turn the task into a testable hypothesis.
* **Assemble**: List assumptions and sub-claims.
* **Pull**: Search only for what validates/refutes the hypothesis.
* **Transform**: Every 2‚Äì3 facts ‚Üí 1 conclusion ‚Üí slide or model input.

**Use for**: Research prompts, benchmarking, pre-slide analysis.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è **Slide Doctrine ‚Äî Communication Discipline**

> Each slide must prove *one* argument with clear logic.

* **Title = Conclusion**
* **Chart = Visual Proof**
* **Body = Implication or next question**

**Use for**: Deck creation, executive presentations, internal memos.

---

### üß≠ **Workflow Cascade**

> Every deliverable should trace back like this:

```
Problem Statement
‚Üí Key Question
‚Üí Issue Tree (MECE Drivers)
‚Üí Hypotheses per Branch
‚Üí Evidence per Hypothesis
‚Üí Findings ‚Üí Synthesis Points
‚Üí Recommendation Options
‚Üí Final Direction + Roadmap
‚Üí Slides
```

**Use for**: Building logically coherent arguments from scratch.

---

### üß∞ **How to Use This Primer**

At the beginning of any session:

* Assume I want outputs framed in OSDC logic.
* If the task is broader, assume we are in a phase of CLEAR.
* If I ask for research or analysis, apply RAPT.
* Deliver outputs as structured slide-level insights, unless otherwise specified.

A. Sales Productitivity per FTE Benchmark pro Region > brauchen wir schnell damit wir das gut in Expert Calls vs. Competitors vergleichen k√∂nnen 

B. Product Portfolio Analyse 
- da gibts ne geile XLS bspw. wo wir pro produkt contribution margin 2 sehen und anzahl verk√§ufe etc

bitte einmal zu beiden punkten die seiten/analysen vorstrukturieren anhand des datenraums dann schauen wir drauf bevor du die daten aufbereitest ok?

The first broader section is my methodology that I work with internally, the section, shorter section are the tasks that were given to me by my seniors. Attached are the relevant files that have valuable data that wasn't yet packaged to be insightful. Please start with A.
