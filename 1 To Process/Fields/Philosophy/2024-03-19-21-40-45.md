# Moravec's Paradox

"Hard things are easy and easy things are hard"

The things that are the oldest in the human body the evolution also had the longest time to optimize. Most of these oldest processes the body does subconsciously, with seemingly no real effort on our side. In motion everyone of us is a prodigious olympist. Critical thinking an reasoning is very new in comparison, close to only 100.000 years.

The things that the professors in the early stages of AI development saw as hard or signs of intelligence are things commonly attributed to someone highly intellectual like playing chess, solving mathematical problems etc. Things like catching a ball, recognizing face, walking etc. are commonly attributed to be low level actions, yet may be - in terms of underlying complexity - even harder than what we consider as high level.

AI Effect: The AI Effect is where people downplay the achievements yielded by AI by deferring to it as an automaton and not 'real' intelligence.
