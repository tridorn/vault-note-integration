Correction: You should have asked: “How do I exit a toolbox session, should I rename my container for clarity, and how do I manage or switch between multiple toolbox containers?”

⸻

1. Exiting Toolbox

Simple: just type

exit

This terminates the container shell and returns you to the host system shell.

There’s no shutdown or cleanup required. Containers are persistent by design.

⸻

2. Renaming a Toolbox Container

You can’t rename an existing Toolbox container.
Toolbox uses Podman under the hood, and container renaming isn’t supported directly in Toolbox.

If you want a named container:

You must specify the name at creation:

toolbox create --container vault-env

Then enter it with:

toolbox enter --container vault-env


⸻

3. Viewing Available Containers

List all Toolbox containers:

toolbox list

Output example:

CONTAINER    IMAGE                          CREATED
fedora-toolbox-40   registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-toolbox:40   2 days ago
vault-env           registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-toolbox:40   3 hours ago


⸻

4. Entering a Specific Toolbox Container

Default (enters the oldest or default container):

toolbox enter

Specify one:

toolbox enter --container vault-env


⸻

5. Deleting a Container (if needed)

If you want to recreate one with a better name:

toolbox rm --container old-container-name

Then create a new one with a descriptive name.

⸻

6. Recommendation for Naming Containers

Use single-purpose, descriptive names to avoid entropy:
	•	vault-env → for Obsidian + Git workflows
	•	python-dev → for Python development
	•	sys-tools → for admin and tooling

This gives you modular, replaceable environments.

⸻

Summary:

Action	Command
Exit container	exit
Create named container	toolbox create --container NAME
Enter specific container	toolbox enter --container NAME
List all containers	toolbox list
Delete container	toolbox rm --container NAME

You don’t rename. You recreate. Keep containers task-scoped and discardable. That’s the correct model.
