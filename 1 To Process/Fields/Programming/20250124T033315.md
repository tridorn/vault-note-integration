Your query could have been framed more specifically: *How does developing a website using Nuxt.js differ from using plain Vue.js?*

Nuxt.js is a **framework** built on top of Vue.js that provides additional structure and features specifically for **universal applications** (also known as **server-side rendering**) and **static site generation**. While Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework focused on building single-page applications (SPAs), Nuxt.js enhances Vue by offering more capabilities for building **SEO-friendly**, **scalable**, and **performant** websites.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how **Nuxt.js** differs from and builds upon **Vue.js**:

### **1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and SEO**

#### **Vue.js**

- Vue.js primarily supports **client-side rendering**. This means the browser fetches JavaScript files, and then Vue dynamically renders the HTML. This approach, while great for dynamic interfaces, can be problematic for **SEO** because search engines may not crawl JavaScript-rendered content effectively.

#### **Nuxt.js**

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** is one of Nuxt.js’s most important features. In SSR, the initial page is rendered on the server and sent as a fully-formed HTML page to the browser. This makes your application much more **SEO-friendly** because search engines can easily crawl the fully-rendered HTML.
  
- SSR also reduces **time-to-first-paint**, improving perceived performance, especially for users with slower connections.

**Example**:
- **Vue.js SPA**: Content is rendered in the browser after JavaScript is loaded, which might delay what the user sees initially.
- **Nuxt.js SSR**: Content is rendered on the server, and the user sees a fully-rendered page faster.

### **2. Static Site Generation (SSG)**

#### **Vue.js**

- Out of the box, Vue.js does not offer **static site generation** capabilities. To build a static website with Vue, you'd typically need additional tools like **VuePress** or manually configure **webpack** to output static files.

#### **Nuxt.js**

- Nuxt.js comes with **Static Site Generation** (SSG) built-in, using the `nuxt generate` command. This allows you to pre-render your Vue pages into static HTML files, making your site extremely fast and easy to deploy on any CDN or static hosting platform (like **Netlify** or **Vercel**).
  
- This makes Nuxt an excellent choice for **blogs**, **landing pages**, or **content-heavy websites** that don’t need dynamic server-side functionality but can benefit from static HTML for fast loading and SEO.

**Example**:
- With Nuxt.js, you can generate a fully static version of your site, which can be served via a CDN for lightning-fast load times.

### **3. File-based Routing System**

#### **Vue.js**

- Vue.js requires you to manually set up routing using **Vue Router**. You need to define each route explicitly and map it to the corresponding components, which can make routing configurations verbose in large applications.

#### **Nuxt.js**

- Nuxt.js provides **file-based routing** by default. You create `.vue` files inside the `pages` directory, and Nuxt automatically generates the necessary routes based on the file structure. This makes routing simpler and more intuitive.

**Example**:
- In Nuxt.js, if you create a file called `about.vue` inside the `pages/` directory, Nuxt automatically creates the `/about` route for you, no need to manually configure routes.

```bash
/pages/about.vue -> localhost:3000/about
```

This can significantly speed up development, especially for projects with many pages.

### **4. Default Project Structure and Conventions**

#### **Vue.js**

- Vue.js doesn’t enforce a specific project structure. You can organize components, assets, and routes however you like. While this flexibility is beneficial for small projects, it can lead to inconsistencies in larger applications.
  
- You’ll need to manually set up tools for **state management**, **routing**, and **store configurations** (e.g., Vuex).

#### **Nuxt.js**

- Nuxt.js enforces a **convention-based file structure** that simplifies development and ensures consistency across projects.
  - **Pages**: Automatically generate routes.
  - **Components**: Organized in a separate directory.
  - **Store**: Pre-configured Vuex store if needed.
  - **Static**: Static assets like images are placed here.
  
- This structured approach makes it easier to scale larger projects and improves developer productivity by reducing configuration overhead.

**Example**:  
In Nuxt.js, the project structure might look like this:

```bash
- pages/
  - index.vue
  - about.vue
- components/
  - Header.vue
  - Footer.vue
- static/
  - logo.png
- store/
  - index.js
```

Nuxt automatically handles routing, state management, and asset handling based on these directories, allowing you to focus on development rather than configuration.

### **5. Middleware and Layouts**

#### **Vue.js**

- Vue.js doesn’t come with **built-in middleware** or layout systems. You would need to manually implement these features, typically by using **Vue Router** and managing layouts across components.

#### **Nuxt.js**

- Nuxt provides a **middleware** system that allows you to handle logic (e.g., authentication, redirects) before rendering a page. This can be done globally or for specific routes.
  
- **Layouts**: Nuxt comes with a layout system that allows you to define consistent layouts for your pages. For example, you can have different layouts for authenticated users, admin pages, etc.

**Example**:  
In Nuxt.js, you can define a `default.vue` layout for the main structure of your site (header, footer), and any page that needs a unique layout (e.g., `admin.vue`) can use a different layout.

```bash
/layouts/default.vue
/layouts/admin.vue
```

### **6. State Management (Vuex Integration)**

#### **Vue.js**

- In Vue.js, you can use **Vuex** for state management, but you need to set it up manually and configure it yourself.

#### **Nuxt.js**

- Nuxt.js comes with built-in **Vuex** support. If you add a `store/` directory, Nuxt automatically initializes Vuex, and you can start defining your state, mutations, and actions without extra configuration.

**Example**:  
Simply create files inside the `store/` directory, and Nuxt will automatically detect and integrate them with your app.

```bash
/store/index.js
```

### **7. Built-in Features (SEO, Meta, Async Data)**

#### **Vue.js**

- Vue.js is flexible but requires external libraries and manual setup for **SEO optimizations**, **meta tag management**, and **data fetching**.
  
- You would typically use libraries like **vue-meta** or manually control meta tags in `created` hooks.

#### **Nuxt.js**

- Nuxt.js simplifies meta tag management and SEO by providing a built-in **`head`** property where you can declare meta tags, titles, and descriptions for each page. This is especially useful for SSR and SSG, where SEO is a priority.
  
- **Data Fetching**: Nuxt includes easy-to-use hooks like `asyncData` and `fetch` to handle asynchronous data fetching before rendering the page. This is done at the server-side when using SSR.

**Example**:  
Setting meta tags in Nuxt is as simple as adding the `head` property to your page component:

```javascript
export default {
  head() {
    return {
      title: 'About Us',
      meta: [
        { hid: 'description', name: 'description', content: 'About our company' }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **8. Plugins and Modules**

#### **Vue.js**

- Vue.js projects require manual setup of plugins and third-party modules. You'll need to configure them explicitly for each feature or library.

#### **Nuxt.js**

- Nuxt has a **modules system** that makes integrating third-party libraries easier. Popular plugins like **Axios**, **PWA**, **Auth**, and others have ready-made Nuxt modules that simplify their integration.
  
- Example: Adding **Axios** to a Nuxt project is as simple as installing the Nuxt Axios module:

	```bash
   npm install @nuxtjs/axios
   ```

	Then add it to the `modules` array in `nuxt.config.js`:

	```javascript
   modules: ['@nuxtjs/axios']
   ```
