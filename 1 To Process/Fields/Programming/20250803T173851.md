Correction: Instead of "My questions is aimed at that I want to make a genuine cut and switch completely," a more coherent formulation would be: "My question pertains to executing a complete and permanent migration from Windows to Linux."

* * *

Your trajectory--Mint → Tumbleweed → Arch → Silverblue → NixOS--is conceptually sound for progressive acclimatization, but strategically inefficient if the objective is full operational migration rather than experimental tinkering. A complete switch necessitates eliminating fallback dependency on Windows, not indulging in an elongated Linux tourism itinerary.

  

### Strategic Evaluation:

  

#### 1.

#### Objective Clarity

  

If the goal is a genuine and permanent transition:

- Minimise intermediate distributions.
- Prioritise learning curve consolidation and ecosystem-specific operational habits.
- Treat the migration as a professional re-platforming, not an exploratory hobby.

  

#### 2.

#### Mint (Redundant)

  

Mint is architected for Windows migrants, but its Ubuntu base and conservative UX are pedagogically limited. It teaches little about the structural underpinnings of Linux. It delays confrontation with the actual complexities you will later need to master. Drop it.

  

#### 3.

#### Tumbleweed (Overhead Without Long-Term Payoff)

  

Rolling release, systemd-based, but its zypper-based package management and YaST abstractions won't transfer well to future targets (Fedora or NixOS). The operational knowledge gained here is not portable. Skip it.

  

#### 4.

#### Arch (Transitional or Endgame)

  

Valuable only if you commit to it as an end-state for at least 6--12 months. Installing and maintaining Arch demands procedural rigor and system familiarity--what you learn here is foundational: systemd, Pacman, initramfs, kernel hooks, manual bootloader management, etc. Optional if you intend to go directly to Fedora or NixOS, but useful if you want to understand "how Linux works" in a raw environment.

  

#### 5.

#### Silverblue (Best Immediate Cutover Option)

  

Immutable, rpm-ostree-based, layered with Flatpak. It encourages declarative system management and detachment from traditional package sprawl. Ideal bridge to NixOS, particularly if you intend to move toward immutable, reproducible workflows. Jump here directly after Arch (or skip Arch and start here).

  

#### 6.

#### NixOS (Long-Term Operational Baseline)

  

If you intend to eventually anchor your workflows in reproducibility, declarative configuration, and deterministic state, NixOS is the terminal node. But its learning curve is severe. Avoid it as a beginner's entry. Spend at least 3--6 months on Silverblue, ideally using toolbx for transitional command-line flexibility, before making the NixOS pivot.

* * *

### Tactical Recommendation (Adjusted Path):

  

Windows → Fedora Silverblue → NixOS

- Set up Silverblue.
- Eliminate dual-boot or VM fallbacks; force yourself to operationalise daily tasks in Linux.
- Use toolbx containers for anything missing.
- Port your workflow and data over fully.
- Once your use-case stabilises, begin modular experiments with Nix (home-manager first, then full NixOS rebuild).

  

Skip Mint, skip Tumbleweed. Arch only if your intent is to learn the internals by operating on bare metal. Otherwise, it's a detour.

* * *

### Decision Implications:

- Time to Stability: Shortest if you start with Silverblue. Longest if you indulge in the full distro-hopping itinerary.
- Learning Depth: Highest with Arch, deepest with NixOS. Silverblue sits in between.
- Operational Redundancy: Avoid accumulating knowledge in package managers and system tools you will not retain long-term (e.g. zypper, APT-based UIs).
- Mental Overhead: Too many transitions weaken system intuition. Strip the path to essentials.

  

The cleanest cut: Silverblue as the immediate base, NixOS as the strategic platform. Burn the ships.
