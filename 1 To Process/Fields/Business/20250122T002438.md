Education is the core pillar which everything revolves around, or rather is built on/attached to.  
Education are the maps primarily. The website is structured around the maps and every other pillar is, once again, only attached to education, not present as their own page.  
Website is structured around education, meaning different topics, not structured around maps! Maps only can be be part of a topic.

So to reiterate, the website is built around topics (so not really built around education? Or should I count topics towards education?) and everything related to the topics is under that
