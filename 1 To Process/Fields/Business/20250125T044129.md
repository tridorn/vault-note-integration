# The 7 Human Hijacks

--- 

## 1. Connect What You Want to Stick in Your Audience Brain with Something Else

- Donald Trump's "verbal killshots". Like sleepy Joe, crooked Hillary
- "Your brain on drugs" connects a frying egg with drugs

--- 

## 2. Change Everyday Behavior of Customers

--- 

## 3. Don't Sell Preventives, Sell the Cure

Sell things that cure pains, not nice-to-haves. Things that instantly cure pains will sell way more than something that may ease life for the future

"Life is all about avoiding pain and seeking pleasure"

- Bruce Lee

--- 

## 4. Help People Rebell, or Feel Superior

People don't want to be like the other sheep, bend down to mainstream pressure

Eg younglins separating themselves from older.

## 5. Unusual Images Will Stick in the Human Mind
