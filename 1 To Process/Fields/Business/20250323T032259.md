Envisions profiles on Ben Dyk to be blueprints of the current state of projects like startups. The profile serves as an overview or reference of whether certain components, like mission and vision, are addressed or up to current best practices. The concept of the builder has been expanded, where the builder is responsible for creating the profile based on user input and managing implementation steps. The user is reconsidering if 'profile' and 'builder' are the best terms for these concepts.
