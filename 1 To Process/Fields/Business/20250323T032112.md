Wants to introduce profiles and a builder to the Ben Dyk website. Profiles are blueprints that show a structured state, such as a startup profile, listing everything relevant for the subject (e.g., internal communication, legal, funding). These profiles serve as static states to reach and are filled with relevant modules using the existing structure. The builder is the dynamic tool that attaches to the profiles wherever something actionable needs to be done, helping users achieve the profile's goals. It is used for initiating the profile and assisting in various tasks required to reach the optimal state. Visual differentiation will be used to highlight builder sections (e.g., through color).
