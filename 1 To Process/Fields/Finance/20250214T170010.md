Your approach is solid, but there are nuances to consider when deciding how to handle futures trading efficiently, particularly as a European trader.

## **1. TradingView vs. Broker's Native Platform**
TradingView is an excellent charting tool, but it is not a trading platform designed for professional execution. If you plan to day trade futures, your execution speed and reliability must be paramount. Here’s the breakdown:

### **Pros of TradingView for Trading Execution**
- **Superior Charting**: TradingView offers an intuitive and visually clean charting experience.
- **Custom Indicators & Alerts**: Easier to set alerts and manage multiple timeframes.
- **Multi-Broker Support**: You can switch brokers without switching platforms.

### **Cons of TradingView for Trading Execution**
- **Latency & Execution Risk**: Orders are routed through TradingView’s API to your broker, adding potential latency.
- **Limited Order Flow Tools**: TradingView lacks depth-of-market (DOM) and true market-by-tick visibility, which futures traders often rely on.
- **Reliability Issues**: Any API disconnect between TradingView and your broker could cause problems during high-volatility moments.

### **Conclusion**: **Use TradingView for charting, but place trades directly through your broker's platform** (TWS for IBKR or whatever AMP provides, such as CQG or Rithmic). If you insist on TradingView execution, use it only for swing trading or when order latency isn't a major concern.

## **2. Broker Selection: Interactive Brokers vs. AMP Futures**
You mentioned **Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and AMP Futures** as potential brokers. Since you are in Europe, IBKR is almost a must for options trading, but here’s how they compare for futures:

| Feature              | Interactive Brokers (IBKR) | AMP Futures |
|----------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Commissions**      | Higher ($0.85/contract) | Lower ($0.30-$0.50/contract) |
| **Margin Requirements** | Higher | Lower (Intraday: ~$500 per contract) |
| **Execution Speed**  | Good but not best for scalping | Optimized for futures trading |
| **Platform Choices** | TWS (complex) | CQG, Rithmic, Sierra Chart, Jigsaw, etc. |
| **Options Trading**  | Yes | No |
| **Market Data Fees** | Higher | Lower |

### **Recommendation**
- If you **prioritize a single broker for both options and futures**, **stick with IBKR**, but be aware that their futures commission and margin requirements are suboptimal.
- If you **want the best execution environment for futures**, **use AMP Futures** alongside IBKR. AMP has significantly lower commissions, access to specialized futures platforms (CQG, Rithmic), and lower intraday margins.
- **Best Setup:** Trade **options via IBKR** and **futures via AMP Futures** with CQG/Rithmic for execution.

## **3. Platform Recommendations for Futures**
If you go with AMP Futures, I recommend using:
- **Sierra Chart** (best for footprint charts, DOM, and execution efficiency).
- **Jigsaw Daytradr** (best for order flow and DOM-based scalping).
- **CQG or Rithmic** (better execution feeds than TradingView).

If you stick with IBKR, **you can still use TradingView for charting and TWS for execution**, but the experience is not as seamless for day trading futures.

## **Final Setup Recommendation**
### **Option 1: All-in-One (Less Hassle)**
- **Use IBKR for both options & futures**.
- **Use TradingView for charting, but execute via IBKR TWS**.
- **Accept higher commissions & margin requirements**.
- **Better if you want a simple setup with one broker**.

### **Option 2: Optimized for Performance (Best Execution)**
- **Use IBKR for options**.
- **Use AMP Futures for futures trading** (via CQG/Rithmic & a better platform like Sierra Chart).
- **Use TradingView for charting but execute through the best futures platform available**.
- **Lower commissions, better execution speed, and optimized order flow tools**.

Given your intent to **take trading seriously and day trade index futures**, Option 2 is **strongly recommended**. Let me know if you need help setting up the software or understanding market data subscriptions.
