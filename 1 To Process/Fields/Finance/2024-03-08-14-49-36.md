--- 

## Definition

A hammer is a [[2024-03-08-13-38-08|Candlestick Pattern]] that forms during a *downtrend* and has little or no upper shadow and a long lower shadow.

## Bearish or Bullish?

It is a bullish reversal pattern that shows an end to the downtrend might be near. 

--- 

## What Are Recognition Criteria for a Hammer?

Primarily, a long shaft with a larger head, often made out of metal.

Secondary criteria:

- long shadow is about two or three times the size of the box
- little or no upper shadow 
- the box is at the upper end of the trading range
- color of the box is not important

Do not take a hammer as sole confirmation for this but wait for other bullish signals if you want to enter a long position.
