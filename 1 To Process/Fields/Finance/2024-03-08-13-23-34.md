## Definition

A Chart is a visual representation of a price (of any financial asset with price data) over a set period of time.

## How to Read

The y-axis (vertical) represents the price scale and the x-axis (horizontal) represents time scale. Prices are plotted from left to right across the x-axis.

A chart aggregates testenenvery buy and sell transaction of that financial instrument at any given moment. It incorporates all available market information as well as traders' current expectations of future news.[^1]
