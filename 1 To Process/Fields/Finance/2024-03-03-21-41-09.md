## Base and Quote Currency

When opening a position you exchange one currency for the other. They are quoted as currency pairs, with the *first one being the base currency* and *the second one the quote currency*. The base currency is the reference element for the exchange rate and always has value of one.

## Buying Means Quote in Exchange for Base Currency

When buying, the exchange rate tells you how much you have to pay in units of the quote currency to buy one unit of the base currency. You are basically selling the quote currency (you have to pay in/with the quote currency) and buying the base currency.

## Selling Means Base in Exchange for Quote Currency

When selling, the exchange rate tells you how much man units of the quote currency you get for selling one unit of base currency.
