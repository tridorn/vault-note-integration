## Definition

Balance is the total amount of cash you have in your trading account. If you have an open position, even if it has a floating profit (or loss), your Balance is still the same as before you opened the position. But once you close the position, the profit (or loss) will be added (or deducted) from the Balance and this will be your new Balance.
