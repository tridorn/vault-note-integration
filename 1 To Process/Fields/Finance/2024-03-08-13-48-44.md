title: Support and Resistance
abstract: This note is a rare non-atomic note as it serves as an overview to two topics that also have their own notes. Support and Resistance are vague price zones in which the price moves and which heavily depend on the subject and even the time frame the chart is viewed through.

# Support and Resistance

--- 

## Introduction

[[2024-03-08-13-50-24|Support]] and [[2024-03-08-13-52-10|Resistance]] are no absolute levels, they heavily depend on interpretation of the [[2024-03-08-13-53-09|Technical Analyst]]. They can even look different depending on the time frame. They should be **viewed more as zones** rather than exact numbers. One way to filter out noise is to use [[2024-03-08-14-41-33|Line Chart]] rather than [[2024-03-31-21-22-26|Candlestick Chart]] (because Line Charts only show the closing price, "irrational" movement of the market should be reduced).

## General Guidelines

- A broken-through resistance or support can in turn change into a support or resistance. A main reason for that is that liquidiation or selling of positions may occur when breaking either resistance or support. 
- The more often a resistance or support is tested, the stronger it is
- How strong a follow up to a broken resistance or support is depends on how strong it has held before
