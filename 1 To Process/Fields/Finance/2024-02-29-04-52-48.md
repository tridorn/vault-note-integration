# Currency Pairs

## Introduction

Forex trading means selling one currency and buying the other one - everything is bought as currency pairs.

Categories of currency pairs:

1. Majors
2. Crosses
3. Exotics

Lesser traded pairs like exotic pairs have lower liquidity and higher spreads. They also are more sensitive to economic and geopolitical events.

## Major Pairs

--- 

## Cross-Currency

Pairs that do not include USD (crosses that both are major currencies are also called minors).

---

## Exotic Pairs

Consist of one major currency and one currency from an emerging market.
