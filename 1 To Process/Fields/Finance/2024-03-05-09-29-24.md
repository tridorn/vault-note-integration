# Trailing Stop

---

## Definition

A trailing stop order is a [[2024-03-05-09-25-20|Stop Loss Order]] that not statically stays in its places but dynamically follows price changes. 

--- 

## Example

If the trailing stop is set to 20 [[2024-02-29-05-16-28|pips]] and the price goes up (in a long position) the exit point will always stay 20 pips behind the highest market price.
