Setting up a comprehensive and efficient workspace on your computer for monitoring financial markets and staying updated with the latest news involves a mix of real-time data platforms, news feeds, and analytical tools. Here's a suggested setup that could help you stay informed and make informed decisions throughout the trading day. This setup assumes you have access to multiple monitors, which is ideal for trading and financial analysis, but can be adapted for fewer screens.

### Monitor 1: Real-time Market Data and Trading Platform
- **Primary Tab**: Your trading platform, such as TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim, Interactive Brokers, or Robinhood, where you can execute trades, monitor open positions, and view real-time charts and data.
- **Secondary Tabs**: Real-time market data platforms like Bloomberg Terminal (if accessible due to its high cost), TradingView for charts and analysis, or Yahoo! Finance for a free option.

### Monitor 2: News and Analysis
- **Primary Tab**: A financial news streaming service or TV program online. CNBC or Bloomberg TV can be streamed live through their websites or apps, providing continuous coverage and analysis.
- **Secondary Tabs**:
  - **Bloomberg** or **Reuters** for global financial news.
  - **Seeking Alpha** or **Motley Fool** for stock analysis and opinions.
  - A financial calendar site like the Economic Calendar on Forex Factory or Investing.com to keep track of economic announcements and earnings releases.

### Monitor 3: Social Media and Real-time Updates
- **Primary Tab**: Twitter, set up with lists to follow financial analysts, economists, and news outlets for real-time updates and commentary.
- **Secondary Tabs**:
  - A financial forum or community such as StockTwits, r/investing, or r/wallstreetbets on Reddit for market sentiment and discussions.
  - **Discord** or **Slack**, if you're part of trading communities or groups for real-time discussions and tips.

### Utilities and Tools:
- **Standalone Applications**: Consider having Excel or a similar spreadsheet application open for tracking trades, calculations, or running models. Evernote or OneNote can be useful for note-taking throughout the day.
- **Notifications**: Set up desktop or phone notifications for your trading platform and news apps to alert you to market movements, news alerts, or important updates.

### Browser Extensions and Add-ons:
- Consider adding browser extensions that can enhance your productivity and information gathering, such as:
  - **Pocket** for saving articles to read later.
  - **OneTab** to manage and reduce tab clutter.
  - **News Feed Eradicator** for Chrome or Firefox if you use Facebook but want to avoid distractions.
  - Financial market-related extensions like "The Camelizer" for Amazon price history or "Honey" for discount codes can be useful for personal finance but are optional based on your focus.

This setup is quite comprehensive and may require adjustments based on your specific needs, interests, and the resources you have available. You can scale it down if you're working with fewer monitors or simplify it if you're focusing on specific markets or instruments.
