## Overview

The entry point for the most important invention of humanity. Language is the broader overarching topic for sub-categories such as [[20250407T154057|Writing]] and [[20250407T151710|Reading]], real languages like German and English, computer languages like HTML/CSS and Javascript, and even other things I personally consider languages, such as maths (really, any medium to express concepts).
