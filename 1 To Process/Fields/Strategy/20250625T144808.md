**Correction:** Your question, _"What are the rational future outlooks? What is possible, what definitely isn't?"_ would be better articulated as:  
**"Outline the structurally realistic future trajectories of the Russia--Ukraine war. Identify scenarios that remain within the realm of strategic plausibility, and discard outcomes that are no longer feasible under current and forecastable constraints."**

* * *

### Strategic Outlook: Russia--Ukraine War (2025--2027 Horizon)

This analysis identifies **what remains structurally possible**, **what is no longer viable**, and the **dominant scenario vectors**--based not on aspirational thinking or moral framings, but on power, capacity, and system incentives.

* * *

## I. Scenarios No Longer Strategically Feasible

These outcomes can be rationally excluded barring unforeseen systemic shocks:

### 1. **Total Russian Victory (Full Subjugation of Ukraine)**

**Implausible**. Requires:

- Collapse of Ukrainian political cohesion
- Overrun of fortified zones across a 1,200 km front
- Logistics Russia cannot currently sustain
- Western passivity or abandonment

None of these conditions are aligning. Russia lacks the manpower, logistics, and legitimacy to hold Ukraine's major cities, let alone govern them.

### 2. **Ukrainian Reconquest of All 1991 Territory (Including Crimea) by Force**

**Highly improbable** under current conditions. Crimea is militarised, deeply entrenched, and politically internalised by Russia. Even with advanced Western weapons, Ukraine would require:
- Air dominance
- Massive breakthrough capacity
- Full logistical saturation from NATO

This would risk direct escalation with Russia, including potential nuclear signaling. Western backers are risk-averse to this.

### 3. **Negotiated Settlement Producing Durable Peace**

**Structurally blocked**. Both regimes are politically unable to concede:

- For Putin, withdrawal equals regime collapse.
- For Ukraine, ceding territory is politically radioactive.  
Neither side has incentives aligned for peace. Only a **mutual exhaustion-based armistice**, not peace, is viable short-term.

* * *

## II. Scenarios Within Rational Possibility Space

These scenarios are structurally possible, depending on military dynamics, political shifts, and external pressures.

### A. **Stalemate + Frozen Conflict (Most Probable Baseline)**

A protracted, Korean-War-style line of control, with periodic escalations, drone strikes, long-range fires, but no major breakthroughs. De facto partition.

**What enables it**:

- Western military aid at "sustain-but-not-escalate" levels
- Russia adapting to attrition warfare
- No decisive moral collapse on either side

**Implications**:

- Ukraine becomes a partial EU-NATO protectorate
- Russia locks in its gains but pays indefinite cost
- Long-term military-industrial race begins

### B. **Ukraine Gains Tactical Ground, But No Strategic Collapse of Russia**

Ukraine reclaims limited strategic positions (e.g., parts of Zaporizhzhia or Donetsk), but cannot push into Crimea or fully evict Russian forces. Russia stabilises with conscription and import-substitution, shifting to war economy permanently.

**What enables it**:

- Steady Western support, better drone warfare, Russian operational fatigue

**Implications**:

- Erosion of Russian force quality
- Persistent security risk to Ukraine, not resolution
- No full victory, only denial of Russian success

### C. **Russian Offensive Gains via Western Fatigue or U.S. Political Shift**

If Western support contracts (e.g., U.S. cuts off funding under a new administration), Russia could press its advantage through sheer volume and economic mass.

**What enables it**:

- Western political fracture
- Sustained Russian mobilisation
- Ukrainian supply chain collapse

**Implications**:

- Partial reconquest (e.g., Kharkiv)
- Ukrainian sovereignty under existential threat
- Possible push to force "negotiated surrender"

This is the Kremlin's primary hope: not battlefield victory, but Western abandonment.

* * *

## III. Structural Wildcards (Low Probability, High Impact)

### • **Internal Regime Shock in Russia**

Coup, elite fracture, or economic rupture could change decision-making calculus. Currently unlikely. Putin's control mechanisms remain intact.

### • **NATO--Russia Direct Clash**

NATO boots on ground, no-fly zones, or direct strike campaigns are currently politically off-limits. Only a direct Russian attack outside Ukraine would trigger this.

### • **Ukrainian Political Disintegration**

Exhaustion, corruption scandals, or elite breakdown could damage national cohesion. Not visible yet, but conceivable under prolonged strain without clear progress.

## Summary Matrix

| Scenario | Plausible? | Driver | Strategic Outcome | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Russian total victory | No | Capacity shortfall | Excluded | 
| Ukrainian total reconquest | No | Political + logistical ceiling | Excluded | 
| Durable peace agreement | No | Incompatible incentives | Excluded | 
| Frozen conflict (Korea model) | Yes | Attrition + political stasis | Most probable | 
| Ukrainian tactical gains | Yes | Sustained Western support | Containment of Russia | 
| Russian renewed offensive | Yes | Western disengagement | Strategic danger for Ukraine | 
| Internal regime collapse in Russia | Low | Unpredictable catalyst | Could reset entire equation |

### Final Assessment

No one is winning this war in absolute terms. But **Putin has already lost his original objectives**. His fallback strategy is attritional survival until the West fractures.

For Ukraine, the war will likely end not with victory, but with **denial of Russian success**. That outcome, paradoxically, may be the best-case scenario under current structural conditions.

Let me know if you want a red-team forecast under specific contingencies (e.g. Trump presidency, China-Russia alignment, or EU budget cuts).
