This is an important consideration, and the balance between **logging tasks in the system** and **just doing them** depends on the project stage, the complexity of the task, and how much structure you need to stay on track.

Here’s an assessment of when it’s better to "just do it" versus logging tasks in the system, particularly in the **ideation** stage:

---

### **1. When to "Just Do It"**

- **Low Complexity**: If the task is simple, short, or doesn’t require tracking, it’s often better to execute it immediately.
  - **Example**: "Brainstorm ideas for project X."
  - Reason: Writing it down can add unnecessary overhead for something you can complete in a few minutes.
  
- **Low Dependency**: If the task doesn’t rely on other work or need coordination with others.
  - **Example**: "Sketch a rough outline for a new website."
  - Reason: There’s no need to formalize standalone tasks with no follow-ups.

- **Momentum Is Key**: If the act of logging a task breaks your flow or delays starting, it’s better to proceed immediately.
  - **Example**: "Research competitors for inspiration."
  - Reason: Quickly jumping into research might spark more creativity than spending time structuring the task.

- **Ideation Stage Tasks**: In this stage, many tasks are exploratory and organic. Logging them can slow down creative processes.
  - **Example**: "Jot down initial goals for the project."

---

### **2. When to Log Tasks in the System**

- **Medium/High Complexity**: If the task requires time, multiple steps, or dependencies, it’s worth logging to track progress and ensure clarity.
  - **Example**: "Organize brainstorming session with team."
  - Reason: Involving others or scheduling requires coordination, which benefits from being tracked.

- **Collaboration**: If the task involves other people or requires you to follow up, logging ensures accountability and prevents things from falling through the cracks.
  - **Example**: "Send email to client for feedback on initial ideas."
  - Reason: Follow-ups and external inputs benefit from structured tracking.

- **Deadlines/Time Sensitivity**: If the task has a time component (e.g., "Complete brainstorming session by Friday"), logging it ensures visibility and helps manage priorities.
  - **Example**: "Finalize list of brainstorming topics by Thursday."
  - Reason: The deadline needs to be visible in your system.

- **Alignment with Bigger Goals**: If the task directly contributes to moving the project forward in a structured way, logging it clarifies the link to your overall goals.
  - **Example**: "Define project objectives after brainstorming."
  - Reason: Capturing this step keeps the project focused and organized.

### **3. General Guidelines for Ideation Tasks**

#### **Use Notes for High-Level Outlines**

- During ideation, capture **broad ideas and potential tasks** as notes in the project card. These notes don’t have to be formal tasks but serve as a reference for what could be done.
  - **Example**:
	 - Notes: 
		- "Explore market trends."
		- "Brainstorm features."
		- "Identify competitors."
  - Convert to tasks later if needed (e.g., when moving to planning or execution).

#### **Only Log What’s Actionable**

- Avoid logging vague or exploratory tasks. Instead, focus on capturing specific next steps when clarity emerges.
  - **Not Ideal**: "Come up with great ideas."
  - **Better**: "Brainstorm 3 potential features for MVP."

#### **Use "Quick Capture" For Smaller Tasks**

- If you think of a task while working on something else, use a quick capture tool or your task system to jot it down without disrupting the flow.
  - **Example**: "Add 'Competitor Research' as a note for later review."

### **4. Advantages and Drawbacks**

#### **Advantages Of "Just Doing It"**

- Saves time for short, simple tasks.
- Keeps you in a flow state, especially during creative or brainstorming sessions.
- Reduces administrative overhead.

#### **Drawbacks Of "Just Doing It"**

- Lack of visibility can lead to overlooked or forgotten tasks.
- Risk of losing track of progress, especially in larger or more complex projects.

#### **Advantages Of Logging Tasks**

- Provides structure and accountability.
- Ensures clarity for complex, multi-step, or collaborative work.
- Facilitates reviews, follow-ups, and long-term tracking.

#### **Drawbacks Of Logging Tasks**

- Adds administrative work.
- Can interrupt creative flow or momentum.
- Risk of overloading the system with unnecessary details.

### **5. My Recommendation**

#### **For Ideation Projects**

1. **Just Do It for Small Tasks**:
	- If the task is quick, independent, or exploratory (e.g., brainstorming ideas, jotting down thoughts), skip logging and execute immediately.

2. **Use Notes for Exploration**:
	- Document broad goals, ideas, and potential next steps in the project card notes.

3. **Log Only Key Actionable Steps**:
	- As you move out of ideation or start seeing clear tasks emerge (e.g., organizing a brainstorming session, researching competitors), log only what’s necessary to maintain momentum.

#### **For All Other Stages**

- Prioritize logging tasks when they involve **collaboration**, **dependencies**, or **time sensitivity**.
- Keep the system clean by only creating tasks for actionable items.

---

### **6. Practical Workflow**

#### **During Ideation**

- Write broad notes in the project card: "Research market trends, brainstorm features, list competitors."
- If a task is immediately actionable and small, **just do it**.
- Log only essential or collaborative tasks: "Organize team brainstorming session."

#### **After Ideation**

- During reviews, revisit project notes to:
  - Identify actionable tasks.
  - Log tasks for the **planning stage**: "Break down MVP features."

#### **In Daily Execution**

- Use your `Focus` or `Quick Wins` lists for tasks already logged.
- Trust your notes for unstructured ideation work without overloading your task system.

### **Final Thoughts**

The key is to balance **actionability** with **simplicity**:
- If a task feels like an immediate "next action," log it.
- If it’s exploratory, quick, or momentum-driven, just do it and document the insights in project notes.

This approach minimizes friction while ensuring you stay organized and productive. Let me know if you’d like further refinements!
