Starting an agency as a single person without extensive experience in certain areas, like graphic or video design, and without formal certifications can seem daunting, but it's entirely feasible with a strategic approach. Your strengths in understanding modern technologies, trends, and a solid foundation in law provide a unique angle to start with. Here’s a step-by-step guide tailored for your situation:

### 1. Focus on Your Strengths and Establish a Niche

Initially, concentrate on services where you feel most competent and where there's a clear market need. Given your interests, digital transformation consulting, especially with a legal tech angle, could be a strong starting point. Your legal background is a significant asset here, as many traditional businesses will value the dual expertise in technology and law. This focus will help differentiate your agency in the market.

### 2. Build Your Skills and Outsource Strategically

- **Upskill**: Take advantage of online courses to enhance your knowledge in areas closely related to your services. For web design, platforms like freeCodeCamp, Coursera, and Udemy offer excellent resources. For legal tech, look for industry-specific workshops and webinars.
- **Outsource**: For services outside your expertise, consider partnering with freelancers. Websites like Fiverr, Upwork, and Behance can connect you with skilled professionals in graphic design, video production, etc. This allows you to offer a broader range of services without needing to be an expert in every area.

### 3. Create a Strong Online Presence

- **Professional Website**: Use website builders like WordPress, Squarespace, or Wix to create a professional-looking website. Highlight your unique value proposition, services, and your background. As you're interested in web design, this can also serve as a practical learning project and a portfolio piece.
- **Social Media and LinkedIn**: Utilize social media, especially LinkedIn, to establish your professional brand. Share insights, write articles related to your niche, and engage with both potential clients and industry peers.

### 4. Network and Utilize Word-of-Mouth

- **Leverage Personal Networks**: Start with your existing connections, including friends, family, and former law school contacts. Even if they're not your target clients, they might know someone who is.
- **Attend Industry Events**: Participate in industry-related events, both online and offline. These can be excellent opportunities for networking and introducing your services.

### 5. Start with Small Projects and Scale Gradually

- **Freelance Projects**: Platforms like Upwork or Freelancer can be good places to find initial projects. These can help build your portfolio and testimonials.
- **Offer Free or Discounted Services**: To a select few potential clients in exchange for detailed testimonials and the opportunity to create case studies. This can significantly boost your credibility.

### 6. Focus on Learning and Adaptation

- **Continuous Learning**: Stay committed to learning, both in terms of enhancing your own skills and understanding market needs. The more you learn, the more services you can offer.
- **Adapt Based on Feedback**: Use client feedback to refine your services. Understanding what works and what doesn’t is key to growing your business.

### 7. Legal and Financial Foundation

- **Legal Structure**: Consider the legal structure of your business (e.g., sole proprietorship, limited liability company). In Germany, different forms have different tax implications and liabilities.
- **Financial Management**: Keep track of your finances. Tools like QuickBooks or FreshBooks can help manage invoices, expenses, and taxes.

### Final Thoughts

Starting your agency is about leveraging your current strengths while strategically acquiring or outsourcing skills you lack. Your unique combination of legal knowledge and interest in technology and digital transformation is a strong foundation. Remember, every successful agency started with a single step. Focus on delivering value, and don't be afraid to start small and grow incrementally.

What's one small step you feel ready to take today towards this goal? Whether it's enhancing a skill, starting your website, or even just networking on LinkedIn, each action moves you closer to launching your agency.
