You should have asked: _"What is the tangible, day-to-day user interface for someone working inside this spine--particularly regarding file access, editing, and collaboration for binary content like slides?"_

Here is a **concrete operational picture** of what working inside this system looks like--for both markdown and binary (e.g. slides, PDFs) content.
* * *

## I. Local Repo: The Core Workspace

Every Mission Member works in a **local Git repository** on their machine. It is the canonical workspace.

Example structure (after cloning):
    
    
    projects/
    └── P14-Retrofit/
        ├── mission-M07-Orion/
        │   ├── MasterContent.md
        │   ├── DecisionLog.csv
        │   ├── MetricMap.json
        │   ├── InterfaceContract.yaml
        │   ├── outputs/
        │   │   └── presentation-v03.pdf
        │   └── assets/
        │       ├── logo.svg
        │       └── slides-source.key
    

Files are synced via Git or Git LFS depending on type and size. This repo **replaces ad hoc shared folders** (like Google Drive, Dropbox).

✅ **Markdown, YAML, CSV, JSON** files: versioned normally with Git  
✅ **Slides (.key, .pptx), images, design files**: tracked via Git LFS

* * *

## II. Workflow for Binary Collaboration (e.g. Slides Deck)

Let's say two people collaborate on a Keynote presentation.

### Setup

1. The `.key` file is stored in `/assets/slides-source.key`.

2. It is tracked via Git LFS:
    
        git lfs track "*.key"
    git add assets/slides-source.key
    git commit -m "Add initial version of slides"
    git push
    

### Workflow

- Each collaborator:

    1. Pulls the latest repo:
        
                git pull
        git lfs pull
        

    2. Opens the `.key` file in their local Keynote

    3. Makes edits

    4. Commits new version:
        
                git add assets/slides-source.key
        git commit -m "Refined visual flow"
        git push
        

- Conflicts are rare but possible. Rule: **work sequentially**, or coordinate via Slack.

This is **not real-time collaboration**, but it is **versioned, offline-tolerant, and auditable**. If tighter collaboration is needed, fallback to e.g. Google Slides or Figma temporarily--with final export stored in the repo.

## III. File Access Logic

| Type | Storage | Access Method | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Markdown (.md) | Git | Local clone + Git sync | 
| CSV, JSON | Git | Local clone + Git sync | 
| Binary (≤100 MB) | Git LFS + S3 (R2) | Pulled via `git lfs pull` | 
| Binary (>100 MB) | R2-only (referenced) | Link from `MasterContent.md` or Retool GUI | 
| GUIs (e.g. dashboards) | Retool + SQL | Web interface | 
* * *

## IV. Collaborative Realities

### ✅ Works Well For:

- Structured writing (markdown + version control)
- Data artefacts (JSON, metrics, dashboards)
- Binary outputs (slide decks, exports) **as final artefacts**
- Split-mode work (design → export → commit)

### ⚠️ Limitations:

- No real-time editing of binary files (Keynote/PowerPoint)
- Requires sequential handoff or side-channel coordination
- Larger design systems (e.g. Figma) need cloud-native tools, not Git

**Mitigation:**  
Teams doing slide-intensive work may:

- Co-edit on Google Slides (cloud-native), then export `.pdf` and `.key` into `/outputs/`
- Use `.md` to track content decisions; only export once narrative is stable
* * *

## V. What Replaces Google Workspace Shared Drives?

You don't use a shared drive. You use:

1. **A local Git repo** -- versioned, trackable, complete

2. **Slack channel** -- for coordination (`#m-m07-orion`)

3. **Retool Console** -- for uploads, links, forms (e.g. for non-technical people)

4. **Cloudflare R2** -- for large files not suitable for Git

5. **CI automation** -- ensures all commits pass structure, logs changes
* * *

## Summary

You work locally in a structured Git repo.  
You push/pull structured and binary content.  
If you're a slide-heavy team, use Google Slides _only temporarily_--final artefact still enters the repo, like everything else.

This is not about realtime Google Docs clones.  
It is about **versioned, sovereign execution with auditability**--in a structure you own.
