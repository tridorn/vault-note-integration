A more precisely formulated version of your request might read:  
_"Rationally assess whether I should invest in and carry a dedicated camera in my daily life to reintroduce and systematise personal photography, in light of my affinity for in-game photo modes (e.g., Assassin's Creed Origins onwards), and my observation of reduced casual picture-taking despite omnipresent smartphone cameras."_

**Assessment:**

### 1. **Use-Case Alignment: Gamified Photography vs. Real-World Friction**

Your enjoyment of photo modes in Assassin's Creed stems from a _frictionless, gamified, creatively empowered_environment. That modality optimises for aesthetic satisfaction, not real-world constraints. In contrast, real-world photography incurs costs: physical, temporal, social.

**Implication:** Your enjoyment is conditional on low-friction, highly controlled environments. Translating that into real life means engineering conditions that minimise awkwardness, maximise immediacy, and reduce the 'weight' of intention. A dedicated camera might add friction, not remove it.

### 2. **Smartphone vs. Dedicated Camera: Cost--Benefit Reality**

**Smartphone advantages:**

- Immediate access
- Discretion in public
- Adequate quality for most use cases
- Seamless cloud sync + editing

**Dedicated camera advantages:**

- Higher image quality (particularly in dynamic range, low light, lens versatility)
- Intentionality: may rewire attention and perception
- Social signalling: legitimacy of 'being a photographer'

But:

- Slower deployment time
- Bulk and maintenance
- Redundancy (given modern phones)
- Storage and workflow complexity

**Conclusion:** Unless photography becomes a structured pursuit (e.g., weekly photo walks, project-based documentation), a standalone camera is inefficient for spontaneous everyday use. It increases the _activation energy_ required to shoot.

### 3. **Psychological Trade-off: Framing vs. Capturing**

Your reduced photo-taking likely stems from a conceptual dissonance: smartphones feel utilitarian, not expressive. They are productivity devices, not creative ones. Grabbing a phone doesn't feel like "seeing" -- it feels like "using." A dedicated camera reframes the act as creative, not transactional.

**This is not trivial.** It suggests that the obstacle is psychological-symbolic, not technical. You're seeking a new mental model for visual engagement with the world -- not necessarily better optics.

**Viable Alternatives:**

- Use a smartphone _as if it were_ a camera: install a manual camera app (e.g., Halide, ProCamera), disable notifications during use, adopt a shooting ritual (e.g., daily 3-photo rule).
- Consider compact premium cameras (e.g., Ricoh GR III, Fujifilm X100VI) -- pocketable, fast-startup, and unobtrusive, they mirror smartphone convenience with enhanced intentionality.

### Strategic Recommendation:

1. **Define Objective Formally:** What's the end-state? A portfolio? An archive? Improved perception? Define the deliverable.

2. **Prototype First:** Use your phone in a deliberately 'camera-like' way for 30 days. Observe usage pattern. If that alone increases creative output, no need to escalate hardware.

3. **If momentum sustains:** Buy a compact, fast-access camera (avoid DSLRs/Mirrorless with large lenses unless long-term system investment is intended). Prioritise quick startup, discrete form factor, and JPEG-first workflow.

4. **Structure Practice:** Without deliberate use protocols, the device will gather dust. Treat it as an aesthetic discipline, not a spontaneous option.

### Final Position:

Do not default to purchasing hardware. It does not solve for intent, habit, or friction. Simulate the behavioural change first using constraints and protocols on your phone. Only upgrade if creative throughput is proven and increasing.
