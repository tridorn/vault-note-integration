Here are **five productive ways** to use the next 14 days, ensuring you show up to that meeting with **maximum preparedness** and **actionable insights**:

---

## 1. **Refine Your Pitch Deck & Prototype**

1. **Polish the Visuals:**  
   - Incorporate any user feedback you’ve gathered.  
   - Clean up the design so it looks crisp and consistent (fonts, colors, spacing).  
2. **Rehearse Your Delivery:**  
   - Practice a **5–7 minute** run-through of the pitch deck plus a **2–3 minute** prototype demo.  
   - Time yourself to ensure you finish well within a typical 30–60 minute meeting.  
3. **Mock a Q&A:**  
   - Anticipate tough questions (security, compliance, ROI).  
   - Prepare short, direct answers.

## 2. **Prepare the “Sleek Document” for Internal Distribution**

1. **Create a Draft “Concept Note”** (2–3 pages):  
   - Summarize the problem, your solution, the pilot scope, and the call to action (i.e. “We need data to refine the pilot”).  
2. **Incorporate Light Branding:**  
   - Maybe add your logo or color scheme to create a sense of professionalism.  
3. **Add a “Data Request” Appendix:**  
   - Outline the key questions you want ProCredit to answer (loan sizes, underwriting steps, timeline for a pilot).  
4. **Proofread & Polish:**  
   - Make sure it’s free of typos.  
   - Use bullet points and subheadings for skimmability.

When the meeting happens, you can **hand it over** or **email it** after the call, ensuring it’s easy to circulate internally.

## 3. **Conduct Informal SME or Vendor Interviews**

1. **Talk to Potential Users or Installers:**  
   - If rooftop solar is your wedge, reach out to 2–3 local installers or SMEs who’ve done solar (or want to).  
   - Ask about **pain points**: “Was the loan application lengthy? How did you choose a vendor?”  
2. **Gather Mini Case Studies:**  
   - Identify one SME success story: “They installed solar, but the financing took 3 months.”  
   - Show how your platform could cut that to 3 weeks.  
3. **Incorporate Real Quotes:**  
   - Having direct user quotes in your deck (“We spent weeks finding a vendor…”) can be **powerful** evidence for ProCredit.

## 4. **Map Out Expansion & Monetization Plans**

1. **Think Beyond the Pilot:**  
   - Draft a **1-year roadmap** if the pilot goes well: “We start in Romania with solar, then expand to Bulgaria with more upgrade types.”  
2. **Outline Future Revenue Streams:**  
   - Transaction fees, subscription, or data analytics for carbon tracking, etc.  
3. **Identify Potential Tech/Grant Partners:**  
   - E.g., any local or EU-level programs offering co-funding for digital solutions in green finance?  
4. **Validate with Advisors:**  
   - If you have mentors or contacts in green finance, **get feedback** on your expansion logic.

## 5. **Brush Up on Relevant Regulations & ESG Mandates**

1. **EU Green Deal & Taxonomy Basics:**  
   - Know the gist of how banks must classify “green” loans.  
   - Helps you speak ProCredit’s language—**they’re likely under pressure** to meet certain taxonomy criteria.  
2. **Key EBRD, EIB, or Local Government Programs:**  
   - Understand at a high level how these programs provide **partial guarantees** or interest subsidies.  
   - You can show how your platform can integrate or reference these programs.  
3. **Local Energy Efficiency Incentives:**  
   - In the country/region you’re targeting, are there **utility rebates, feed-in tariffs,** or tax incentives for solar?  
   - This knowledge convinces ProCredit you can incorporate local details seamlessly.
