To **operationalise the venture studio**, you need to treat it as what it truly is: **an institutionalised company-building machine**. Not a co-founder club, not an accelerator, not a loose playground--but a structured, lean vehicle that repeatedly produces companies with ownership, speed, and clarity.

Here's what you need to build and how to structure it:

* * *

## I. **Legal + Financial Foundation**

### 1. **Company Setup (Eupator UG)**

- Form as a **UG (haftungsbeschränkt)** in Germany.
- Broad but precise corporate purpose:  
_"Konzeption, Aufbau, Beteiligung an und Verwaltung von technologiegetriebenen Startups."_

### 2. **Banking & Accounting**

- Open business bank account (e.g. Qonto, Penta).
- Hire a part-time Steuerberater from day one.
- Track all early expenses for conversion into equity/honorarium later.

### 3. **Equity Strategy**

- You retain 80--90% of Eupator initially.
- Hold a **studio equity pool (10--15%)** for key advisors, contributors, and first EiRs.
- Future startups: Studio holds 15--25% equity at incorporation (standardised SAFE or convertible structure).
* * *

## II. **Operational Stack: Minimum Viable Studio Engine**

### 1. **Deal Engine / Studio Stack**

This is your reusable core infrastructure across all venture builds:

| Function | Tool / Setup | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Legal** | One-pager terms, founder agreements, IP template | 
| **Finance** | Notion/Google Sheets cap tables, SAFE templates | 
| **Product** | Access to no-code tools (e.g. Webflow, Bubble), prototyping templates | 
| **Design** | Figma kit, brand base pack | 
| **Growth** | Launch playbook, analytics toolkit, outreach SOP | 
| **Hiring** | Airtable pipeline of EiRs + tech co-founders | 

Standardise everything--each startup begins with a full "launch OS".

* * *

### 2. **Team Architecture**

**You**: Strategic operator + venture architect  
**Part-time CTO-in-residence**: oversees MVP builds  
**Core contributors** (equity or stipend):
- Product Designer
- Legal/Finance ops
- One MBA/EiR as scout/operator

You do _not_ need full-time staff yet. Work with:

- Paid interns
- Freelancers
- Equity-only pre-founder types

Keep burn rate near zero. Move on a _per-venture_ cost basis.

* * *

## III. **Venture Creation Flywheel**

Each venture follows a repeatable 3-phase pattern:

| Phase | Duration | Output | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Discover** | 2--3 weeks | Problem deep dive, pre-founder match | 
| **Sprint** | 6--8 weeks | MVP + first traction | 
| **Spin-out** | 2--4 weeks | Incorporation, studio equity, pre-seed prep | 

### You bring:

- Process
- Capital structuring
- Operational infrastructure

### Founders bring:

- Full-time execution
- Domain insight
- Ambition

You create 2--3 of these cycles per year. Only 1--2 spin out.

* * *

## IV. **Capital Stack & Funding Mechanism**

### 1. **Immediate (0--12 months):**

- **Angel/FO micro-round**: Raise €100--250k convertible (20% discount, €1.5m cap).
- **City/State support**: Tap innovation vouchers and EXIST Gründerstipendium for co-founders.
- **In-kind corporate support**: Cloud credits, lab access, legal hours.

### 2. **Mid-Term (12--24 months):**

- Launch Opportunity Fund I (€10--30m).
- Use studio portfolio as anchor signal.
- 2% management fee, 20% carry, focused on studio alumni only.
* * *

## V. **Governance & Clarity**

Create a **Studio Charter** that defines:
- What you offer startups
- Studio ownership model
- Founder equity structure
- Support timeline (e.g. 3 months hands-on, 9 months support)
- Rights (e.g. pro-rata, IP fallback clauses)

This builds clarity, confidence, and alignment.

* * *

## VI. **Studio Metrics (to track from Day 1)**

| Metric | Goal (Year 1) | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Ventures initiated | 3--5 | 
| Startups spun out | 1--2 | 
| External capital raised | €250k+ | 
| Studio equity held | 15--25%/startup | 
| Time to MVP | <60 days | 

* * *

## VII. **Brand & Visibility**

You need to look _institutional_ on day one. Not student. Not "project."  
Set up:

- [www.eupator.studio](http://www.eupator.studio/) (or equivalent)
- 1-pager for founders, investors, partners
- Studio logo + house style (e.g. bold, Roman, execution-themed)
- Social proof: list advisors, programs, MoUs--even if soft
* * *

## Summary: What You Need

**Legal:** Registered UG, ownership terms  
**Ops stack:** Full digital studio system + playbooks  
**Team:** Lean, part-time, modular  
**Capital:** Micro-funding + grant leverage  
**Pipeline:** 1--2 real venture build cycles in motion  
**Brand:** Public presence that signals permanence

Once you have the above, you're a _real venture studio_.  
Your credibility now stems from _structure + motion_, not credentials.
