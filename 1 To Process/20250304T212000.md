If you're looking for a modern outfit that embodies Askeladd’s mix of cleverness, strength, and Roman-inspired aesthetic, here are a few ideas:  

### **1. Tactical Smartwear (Modern Mercenary Look)**
   - **Jacket:** A well-fitted **tactical jacket** or a **field coat** in earthy tones (brown, olive, or black). Look for military-style details like epaulettes or reinforced shoulders.  
   - **Shirt:** A **high-collar henley** or a **thermal compression shirt** for a streamlined but rugged look.  
   - **Pants:** **Cargo pants or workwear trousers**—something durable but not overly bulky.  
   - **Footwear:** Sturdy **combat boots or sleek leather boots** for a practical yet dominant presence.  
   - **Accessories:** A **military-inspired scarf (shemagh), leather gloves, and a watch with a strong metal case** can add functional sophistication.

### **2. European Gentleman Adventurer (Refined but Practical)**
   - **Jacket:** A **woolen or leather trench coat** (evoking old military greatcoats but in a more modern cut).  
   - **Shirt:** A **tailored button-up shirt** with the sleeves slightly rolled up.  
   - **Pants:** Slim-fit **wool trousers or dark denim**.  
   - **Footwear:** **Leather dress boots** (Chelsea or brogue boots).  
   - **Accessories:** A **scarf, minimalist rings, and a classic timepiece** (think Omega Speedmaster or a pocket watch for an old-world touch).

### **3. Sleek Urban Warrior (Minimalist but Powerful)**
   - **Jacket:** A **fitted moto jacket or structured wool coat** (Askeladd’s cloak, but modern).  
   - **Shirt:** **Turtleneck or fitted crew-neck sweater** (black or dark tones).  
   - **Pants:** Tailored **dark jeans or slim cargo pants**.  
   - **Footwear:** **Combat boots or dress boots**.  
   - **Accessories:** Leather gloves, a minimalist belt, and sunglasses (to give a sense of control and intellect).  

Would you like me to refine this further based on a specific setting (e.g., casual, business, outdoor)?
