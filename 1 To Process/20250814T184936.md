Better: "Evaluate whether to create central 'source summary' markdown files for books, lectures, etc., or to keep only atomic notes linked to a source ID. Assess trade-offs, retrieval impact, and cognitive overhead, and recommend a position."

# Decision framing

  

You are deciding between:

  

Model A -- Atomic-only: Each fact, principle, play, etc., lives in its own markdown note. Source is represented only as metadata in those atomic notes. No separate "source file".

  

Model B -- Atomic + Source Dossier: In addition to atomic notes, maintain one markdown file per source as the anchor, with synthesis, bibliographic data, high-signal locators, and outbound links to the atomic notes derived from it.
* * *

## Trade-off analysis

  

### Retrieval

- A is fastest for cross-topic search. You query tags, titles, or links; you never enter a "source file" unless you remember the origin.
- B gives you a starting point when you recall the source more than the concept. For example, "That April Dunford book" → open dossier → navigate to linked notes. This is a real retrieval path for high-signal sources.

  

### Cognitive mapping

- A forces you to think conceptually (topic → principle → action). Good for synthesis across sources, but you lose the narrative and argument flow of the original.
- B preserves the context of discovery. The source dossier holds its argument structure, key claims, and usage scope. This helps when re-evaluating an old decision because you can revisit the reasoning environment, not just the extracted claims.

  

### Maintenance

- A has zero duplication overhead. A claim appears in one place only.
- B introduces a small maintenance cost: every time you create an atomic note, you add its link to the source file. If you keep it minimal (bibliography + 200-word synthesis + link list), cost is ~1--2 minutes per note.

  

### Volume management

- A scales better when you have hundreds of low-value sources (e.g., articles). You don't want a source file for every throwaway read.
- B is better when the source is dense, recurring, or strategically important. You will want a single "anchor" to orient yourself in it.

  

### Decision support

- A puts all decision-critical content into atomic notes and decision records; you never risk hiding something in a prose summary.
- B allows a "review in place": if you reconsider a past decision, you can check the source dossier to see whether omitted claims might matter now.

## Recommendation

  

Run a hybrid with a strict trigger for creating a source dossier.

  

Always use atomic notes as the primary unit.

Create a source dossier only if the source is:

- Dense enough to yield ≥5 atomic notes, and
- Likely to be revisited or cited (e.g., key book, seminal paper, high-impact lecture, major dataset, recurring meeting).

  

This yields:

- High selectivity: No bloat from trivial sources.
- Retrievability: You have an anchor for important material.
- Low overhead: Maintenance burden only for high-ROI sources.

## How this integrates with your control-plane workbook

1. Workbook REF thread starts the source, sets kill criteria.

2. You capture on cards, distil to atomic notes.

3. If the source meets dossier trigger, you create the dossier during Day 2 PM synthesis.

4. Link all atomic notes to the dossier, and link the dossier to relevant decisions and experiments.

5. When revisiting a topic, you can start from either the map (concept view) or the dossier (source view).

If you like, I can show you a decision tree for when to create a source dossier vs atomic-only, so you never over-produce or under-document. That keeps the system lean and consistent.
