**Refined Formulation of Your Question**

> *“Could you clarify what, precisely, ‘option B—draft the SLA matrix that governs hop‑to‑hop cycle times’ entails?”*

---

## Conceptual Decoding

**Option B** refers to the creation of a **Service‑Level‑Agreement (SLA) matrix**—a single‑page operating covenant that prescribes:

1. **Who** is accountable for each discrete hand‑off in your nine flows.  
2. **What** quantitative turnaround time (TAT) or quality metric must be met.  
3. **When** escalation is triggered.  
4. **How** incentives or penalties are applied.

Think of it as the *operational constitution* that converts your notional process map into enforceable performance law. Without it, every hop degrades into polite promises; with it, latency is priced and therefore managed.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Cycle‑Time Compression**: Cash velocity is the core fitness metric in lending. An SLA forces latency to surface and be killed.  
- **Credibility with Banks**: Regulated lenders trust hard commitments, not aspirational decks. Showing a signed SLA matrix derisks you in credit committees.  
- **Vendor Discipline**: SMEs and vendors comply when non‑performance has explicit consequence (e.g., delayed payment or clawback).  
- **Scalability**: A documented SLA is the prerequisite for automating monitoring later; you can’t code what you haven’t codified.

## Skeleton of the SLA Matrix

| Flow (Ref) | Primary Actor | Target TAT (≤) | KPI Definition | Escalation Trigger | Consequence / Incentive |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| F1 ‑ Lead Capture | Vendor / SME | 15 min | Lead form fully submitted | Incomplete after 30 min | Auto‑nudge, lead relegated in queue |
| F2 ‑ Pre‑Screen | Platform | 10 min | Eligibility verdict issued | >30 min | €50 SLA credit to SME |
| F3 ‑ Quote Upload | Vendor | 24 h | Quote + ESG metadata valid | >48 h | Vendor moves to back‑of‑funnel |
| F4 ‑ Underwriting | Bank | 48 h | Conditional approval / decline | >72 h | Bank forfeits onboarding rebate |
| F5 ‑ Disbursement | Bank | 4 h | Funds hit vendor IBAN | >8 h | Escalate to bank COO; 25 bps fee rebate |
| F6 ‑ Verification | Auditor | 5 d | Verification report accepted | >7 d | Auditor removed from pool |
| F7 ‑ Monitoring Refresh | Platform | 30 min | Dashboard update post‑data pull | >2 h | Internal alert to ops lead |
| F8 ‑ Subsidy Filing | Platform | 3 d | Filing submitted | >5 d | Trigger manual project review |
| F9 ‑ Portfolio Report | Bank | Quarter‑end +15 d | CSRD‑compliant report issued | +20 d | Loss of green‑label on tranche |

*Numbers are illustrative; calibrate against real‑world latency.*

## How to Draft and Ratify

1. **Quantify the Current Reality**  
   - Run a dry‑run of your minimal flow (F1‑F5) and stopwatch each hop.  
   - Set *Target TAT* = best observed time × 1.2 (buffer yet ambitious).

2. **Align Incentives Ex Ante**  
   - Penalties must bite (fee rebates, queue demotion).  
   - Rewards must matter (priority leads, reduced spreads).

3. **Embed Escalation Paths**  
   - Nominate a *named* individual per actor organisation who owns SLA breach response.  
   - Escalation should automatically open a shared channel (Slack, Teams).

4. **Codify and Sign**  
   - Convert the table into a short addendum to your vendor/bank MoU.  
   - Collect signatures—even digital—before the first pilot transaction.

5. **Instrument Monitoring**  
   - Even if your platform is spreadsheets, maintain a shared SLA dashboard (e.g., Airtable + Zapier alerts).  
   - Automate once volumes justify.

### Next Step

If this is the artefact you need, indicate which actors are already at the table and their acceptable penalty currencies. I can then draft the first‑pass SLA matrix tailored to your live context.
