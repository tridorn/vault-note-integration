title: Uptake of Green Loans by SMEs in Eastern Europe and the Balkans
---

Understood. I’ll gather the most recent and relevant statistics on SME green loan uptake, focusing on:
- Eastern Europe and the Balkans (e.g. Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia)
- Concrete data on the gap between available green financing and actual uptake
- Barriers cited by SMEs for not applying (e.g. complexity, lack of awareness, etc.)
- Any comparative figures from EU-wide studies for contrast

I’ll return with compelling, data-backed evidence you can use in your pitch or diagram.

# Uptake of Green Loans by SMEs in Eastern Europe and the Balkans

## Limited Uptake Despite Available Funds 
Eastern Europe and the Balkans have seen **relatively low uptake of green financing by SMEs** compared to the funds available. For example, in Serbia an EU-supported EBRD credit line (the SME Competitiveness Programme) has reached 419 companies since 2019, channeling about **€107 million in loans (plus €9.5 million in EU grants) to local SMEs** for energy efficiency and EU standards upgrades ([Serbian company boosts production with EBRD and EU support](https://www.ebrd.com/home/news-and-events/news/2024/serbian-company-boosts-production-with-ebrd-and-eu-support.html#:~:text=MNG%20Plastik%20Gogi%C4%87%20is%20one,of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Serbia)) ([Serbian company boosts production with EBRD and EU support](https://www.ebrd.com/home/news-and-events/news/2024/serbian-company-boosts-production-with-ebrd-and-eu-support.html#:~:text=Through%20the%20programme%20the%20EBRD,accession%20funds)). This shows some progress, but overall **green loans remain a small fraction of SME finance**. A recent European Banking Authority review found that **green loans to SMEs make up only a minor share of banks’ portfolios**, much smaller than green lending to households or large firms ([](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/e7bcc22e-7fc2-4ca9-b50d-b6e922f99513/EBA%20report%20on%20green%20loans%20and%20mortgages_0.pdf#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20the%20share%20of,such%20as%20equity%20and%20debt)). In many EU-funded programs, SMEs have preferred grants over loans – auditors noted a *“lack of beneficiary interest in loans”* for energy efficiency projects ([Special report 02/2022: Energy efficiency in enterprises](https://www.eca.europa.eu/lists/ecadocuments/sr22_02/sr_energy-effic-enterpr_en.pdf#:~:text=indicated%20the%20lack%20of%20beneficiary,Provisions%20Regulation%20requires%20this%20justification22)). As a result, significant portions of green credit lines in the region have gone underutilized, reflecting a **gap between available green finance and actual SME uptake**.

## Green Financing Availability vs. Usage 
International institutions have allocated sizeable green funds for Eastern European SMEs, but **disbursement rates lag**. In the EU’s 2014–2020 funds, member states initially earmarked €3.2 billion for energy efficiency in enterprises, but later reduced it to €2.4 billion by 2020 as uptake fell short ([Special report 02/2022: Energy efficiency in enterprises](https://www.eca.europa.eu/lists/ecadocuments/sr22_02/sr_energy-effic-enterpr_en.pdf#:~:text=48%20Overall%2C%20the%20funds%20allocated,Transition%20Fund%20and%20the%20European)) ([Special report 02/2022: Energy efficiency in enterprises](https://www.eca.europa.eu/lists/ecadocuments/sr22_02/sr_energy-effic-enterpr_en.pdf#:~:text=billion,Transition%20Fund%20and%20the%20European)). An audit found only **1% of EU energy-efficiency projects for businesses were financed purely with loans**, and even combining loans with grants was limited (e.g. just 167 pure-loan projects EU-wide, ~€30 million total) ([Special report 02/2022: Energy efficiency in enterprises](https://www.eca.europa.eu/lists/ecadocuments/sr22_02/sr_energy-effic-enterpr_en.pdf#:~:text=60%20Another%20eight%20OPs%20in,of%20the%20projects%20receiving)). Most SMEs receiving support opted for grants or blended schemes, with **SMEs comprising over 90% of recipients** of those facilities ([Special report 02/2022: Energy efficiency in enterprises](https://www.eca.europa.eu/lists/ecadocuments/sr22_02/sr_energy-effic-enterpr_en.pdf#:~:text=loans%20%281%20,Similarly%2C%20SMEs%20also%20represented%20the)). In Moldova, one of the more proactive Eastern Partnership countries, a dedicated “Greening Programme for SMEs” delivered grants (up to €75k each) to **85 companies from Nov 2020–Aug 2022** for energy-saving equipment ([](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2023/12/sme-policy-index-eastern-partner-countries-2024_12e74bf3/3197420e-en.pdf#:~:text=consultancy%20support%2C%20and%20training%20services,EaP%20countries%20lag%20behind%2C%20although)). This is a positive example, yet **governments in many neighboring countries “lag behind”** – often relying on donor-funded initiatives like the EU’s *“Promoting Green Lending in the Eastern Partnership”* project to fill the green finance gap ([](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2023/12/sme-policy-index-eastern-partner-countries-2024_12e74bf3/3197420e-en.pdf#:~:text=Governments%E2%80%99%20efforts%20in%20this%20area,channels%20green%20financing%20to%20SME)). In short, **billions in green funds exist for the region’s SMEs, but actual usage has been modest**, pointing to an uptake gap.

## Barriers Cited by SMEs for Low Green Loan Uptake 
SMEs in Eastern Europe and the Balkans face **multiple barriers that dampen their demand for green loans**:

- **Awareness and Information Gaps:** Surveys highlight a *“lack of information on how to start with the energy transition and on available support schemes”* as a key obstacle in Eastern and Southern Europe ([May 2024](https://www.smeunited.eu/admin/storage/smeunited/ccce-best-practices-for-smes-in-the-energy-transition-final.pdf#:~:text=perceived%20slower%20progress%20in%20the,technological%20readiness%20which%20hinders%20the)). Many SMEs are simply **unaware of green financing options or don’t understand the application process**, given no dedicated staff to track climate-related programs. National SME associations report **slower decarbonization progress due to low awareness and few tailored support schemes** ([May 2024](https://www.smeunited.eu/admin/storage/smeunited/ccce-best-practices-for-smes-in-the-energy-transition-final.pdf#:~:text=perceived%20slower%20progress%20in%20the,technological%20readiness%20which%20hinders%20the)). In some countries, over half of SMEs don’t know what help is out there to fund green improvements ([May 2024](https://www.smeunited.eu/admin/storage/smeunited/ccce-best-practices-for-smes-in-the-energy-transition-final.pdf#:~:text=associations%20on%20the%20level%20of,available%20at%20the%20national%20level)).

- **Administrative and Documentation Burden:** Even when financing is available, **complex criteria and paperwork deter smaller firms**. Banks often require detailed data (e.g. energy audits, emissions metrics) to qualify a loan as “green.” The EBA finds SMEs struggle with *“data and documentation requirements”* for green loans, given their limited resources ([](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/e7bcc22e-7fc2-4ca9-b50d-b6e922f99513/EBA%20report%20on%20green%20loans%20and%20mortgages_0.pdf#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20the%20share%20of,such%20as%20equity%20and%20debt)). Complying with EU Taxonomy criteria or proving environmental impacts can be daunting for a small business. This administrative burden raises transaction costs and **discourages SMEs from applying** for green credit lines.

- **Tough Eligibility and Collateral Criteria:** Green credit programs sometimes have strict technical criteria (only certain technologies or climate targets qualify). Many **SMEs cannot meet these thresholds or lack the upfront capital** to invest alongside the loan. Traditional collateral requirements also play a role – smaller firms often have fewer assets to secure loans, making banks hesitant despite credit enhancements. Without sufficient guarantees or subsidies, **banks may perceive SME green projects as higher risk**, limiting approvals.

- **Financial Constraints and Risk Perception:** Ultimately, many SMEs still see green investments as costly or risky. If the **business case (ROI) isn’t clear or energy savings are long-term**, they shy away from borrowing. According to an EU SME panel, the **majority of SME associations say lack of financial support/access to funding is a top barrier** to their members’ green transition ([May 2024](https://www.smeunited.eu/admin/storage/smeunited/ccce-best-practices-for-smes-in-the-energy-transition-final.pdf#:~:text=per%20country,We%20conclude%20with%20recommendations)). In practice this means firms find interest rates too high or payback periods too long without incentives. As the EBRD notes, **SMEs “do not benefit sufficiently from green loan markets”** on commercial terms alone ([](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/e7bcc22e-7fc2-4ca9-b50d-b6e922f99513/EBA%20report%20on%20green%20loans%20and%20mortgages_0.pdf#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20the%20share%20of,such%20as%20equity%20and%20debt)), so demand remains lukewarm unless sweetened by grants or subsidies.

## Eastern vs. Western Europe: Uptake in Context 
**SMEs in Eastern Europe and the Balkans lag behind Western European peers** in tapping green finance and pursuing green investments, though the gap is slowly narrowing. Only **about one-quarter of SMEs in the Western Balkans offer green products or services (25%)**, up from ~20% in 2019 ([[DOC] b8f_annexiitorglobal_en.docx](https://www.wb6cif.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/b8f_annexiitorglobal_en.docx#:~:text=,approaching%20the%20EU)). This is approaching the EU average, but still below the **~32% of SMEs EU-wide that offer green products/services** ([SMEs offering green products or services | Circularity Metrics Lab](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/circularity/thematic-metrics/business/smes-offering-green-products-or-services#:~:text=32,to%20more%20sustainable%20business%20models)). Similarly, Western European SMEs tend to invest more readily in energy efficiency and renewables. A climate survey found that by 2022, **53% of European firms were investing in climate measures**, a figure boosted by Western and Northern Europe; Central-Eastern Europe was catching up (a 15 percentage-point jump in one year) but from a lower base ([What drives firms’ investment in climate action](https://www.eib.org/en/publications/online/all/what-drives-firms-investment-in-climate-action-evidence-from-the-2022-2023-eib-investment-survey.htm#:~:text=,are%20planning%20to%20invest)). In one example, around **75% of Dutch firms were investing in climate action, versus ~53% EU average** ([EIB: SMEs to get €200 million in growth and green financing under EIB accord with SGEF Poland | Science|Business](https://sciencebusiness.net/network-updates/eib-smes-get-eu200-million-growth-and-green-financing-under-eib-accord-sgef-poland#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20half%20of,helping%20maintain%20almost%20450%2C000%20jobs)), highlighting the higher engagement in the northwest. Eastern European SMEs also rely heavily on **grants from EU and development banks** to undertake green projects, whereas many Western SMEs can access bank loans or own capital. Overall, **uptake rates of green financing are lower in Eastern Europe, reflecting the region’s later start and tougher constraints**, whereas Western Europe provides more mature markets and support for SME green finance.

## Institutional Insights and Ongoing Initiatives 
Public institutions recognize this **green finance “absorption gap” for SMEs** and are stepping up efforts. The European Commission has stressed simplifying access: for instance, a proposed *“SME sustainable finance standard”* aims to streamline how SMEs report ESG data to banks, **making it easier to qualify for green loans** ([EU Platform on Sustainable Finance Report](https://www.regulationtomorrow.com/the-netherlands/eu-platform-on-sustainable-finance-report-streamlining-sustainable-finance-for-smes/#:~:text=The%20proposed%20standard%20aims%20to,sustainability%20efforts%20by%20reducing)) ([Streamlining sustainable finance for SMEs - European Commission](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/platform-sustainable-finance-report-streamlining-sustainable-finance-smes_en#:~:text=Streamlining%20sustainable%20finance%20for%20SMEs,their%20climate%E2%80%91related%20efforts%2C%20making)). The European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have launched dedicated programs in the region – often blending loans with technical assistance and investment incentives. The EBRD’s new **“SME Go Green” credit lines (2024)** in the Western Balkans will provide €400 million via local banks, coupled with EU-funded cash-back grants up to 15% for green agri-business and renewables investments ([EBRD and EU launch SME Go Green programme in Serbia](https://www.ebrd.com/home/news-and-events/news/2024/ebrd-and-eu-launch-sme-go-green-programme-in-serbia.html#:~:text=The%20EBRD%2C%20with%20the%20support,the%20SME%20Go%20Green%20programme)) ([EBRD and EU launch SME Go Green programme in Serbia](https://www.ebrd.com/home/news-and-events/news/2024/ebrd-and-eu-launch-sme-go-green-programme-in-serbia.html#:~:text=On%20successful%20completion%20of%20their,and%20the%20agribusiness%20value%20chain)). This kind of subsidy addresses the risk-reward hurdle and is expected to boost uptake. Likewise, in Ukraine, Georgia and peers, initiatives like **EU4Business-EBRD credit lines and FINTECC** are channeling concessional finance to local banks to on-lend for SME climate projects ([](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2023/12/sme-policy-index-eastern-partner-countries-2024_12e74bf3/3197420e-en.pdf#:~:text=electricity%20consumption%20and%20generation%20,its%20EU4Climate%20window%2C%20which%20helps)). 

Crucially, development banks note that **policy and awareness must improve alongside finance**. The OECD/EBRD’s 2024 assessment for Eastern Partnership countries finds that **“dedicated financial incentives for greening SMEs are rare”**, and most countries have yet to integrate SME-specific green targets into strategies ([](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2023/12/sme-policy-index-eastern-partner-countries-2024_12e74bf3/3197420e-en.pdf#:~:text=Dedicated%20financial%20incentives%20for%20greening,programmes%20implemented%20by%20the%20local)). It recommends stronger government action to **“increase awareness and help SMEs go green”** and build capacity so that more small businesses seek out and qualify for green financing ([](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2023/12/sme-policy-index-eastern-partner-countries-2024_12e74bf3/3197420e-en.pdf#:~:text=SME%20agency%20ODA%20,period%20November%202020%20%E2%80%93%20August)) ([](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2023/12/sme-policy-index-eastern-partner-countries-2024_12e74bf3/3197420e-en.pdf#:~:text=Governments%E2%80%99%20efforts%20in%20this%20area,channels%20green%20financing%20to%20SME)). In summary, bridging the green finance gap will require not only more credit lines, but also **simpler procedures, better promotion, and support to SMEs** at each step – so that the region’s thousands of small firms can finally tap into the green funds waiting to be used.

These sources underscore the significant **mismatch between available green financing and actual SME usage**, and the need to address awareness, administrative hurdles, and incentive structures to improve absorption of green funds.
