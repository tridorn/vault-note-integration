### Operative Objective  
Acquire *hard, actor-validated numbers* to populate the twelve narrative questions—without yet deploying code. Treat this as a **structured reconnaissance mission**, not a marketing survey.

---

## 1 Map the Metrics → Source Grid  

| Narrative Question (abbr.) | Data Grain Needed | Plausible Primary Source | Secondary/Desk Proxy if Source Resists |
|----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Pain Audit (Q1) | • Avg. days loan cycle • € hidden fees • # document back-and-forth | 3 SMEs + 1 banker, walk them through their last green purchase | Bundesbank SME lending reports; EIB “Access to Finance” survey |
| Incentive Map (Q2) | KPI definitions + thresholds (e.g., “loan processing ≤ 10 d”) | Bank credit-policy manager, vendor COO | Public CSR reports; EU taxonomy guidance notes |
| Bottleneck (Q3) | Time-stamped hand-off logs | Underwriter workflow export (.csv) | EBA studies on credit decision turn-times |
| Delta (Q5) | Baseline vs pilot cycle-time & cost | Your concierge MVP ledger | McKinsey banking-ops benchmarks |
| Proof (Q6) | Signed statements of improvement | Each actor at pilot close | None—must be original |
| Flywheel (Q7) | Marginal ops hours per extra case | Your internal pilot labour logging | Time-and-motion benchmarks |
| Compliance Edge (Q8) | Quant of audit queries avoided | Bank compliance officer interview | BaFin enforcement statistics |
| Monetisation Logic (Q10) | Budget line & elasticity | SME CFO + Bank product head | KfW programme documentation |

## 2 Data-Acquisition Tactics—Minimal Tech, Max Credibility  

### 2.1 Structured Field Interviews  
*Objective:* Elicit baseline pain and incentive thresholds.

1. **Participant Set**  
   * 3 SMEs (energy-intensive sectors, 10-250 FTE)  
   * 2 Vendors (solar installer, HVAC retro-fit)  
   * 1 Tier-2 German bank underwriter  
   * 1 External verifier ( TÜV, DNV, or similar)  

2. **Instrumentation**  
   * One-hour video call, recorded (with consent).  
   * Use a **time-and-cost questionnaire**—share screen, fill numbers live to avoid later “I’ll get back to you”.  

3. **Script Snippet**  
   > “Last retrofit project: how many calendar days from first vendor quote to funds received? Break it by steps.”  
   > “What explicit fees did you pay? Hidden fees?”  
   > “If that timeline fell by 30 %, what internal KPI would improve?”  

4. **Incentive to Cooperate**  
   *Promise a tailored “Pain-Gap Analysis” PDF plus priority slot in your pilot.*

---

### 2.2 Document Autopsy  
*Objective:* Extract objective timestamps and document counts.

1. Ask banker and SME to **share a redacted deal folder** of their last green loan.  
2. Catalogue: file name, sender, date.  
3. Compute hand-off intervals in Excel—this reveals actual bottlenecks.

---

### 2.3 Concierge Micro-Pilot  
*Objective:* Generate fresh delta metrics (Q5 & Q6).

- Use the **lean seven-facet ledger** you already sketched.  
- Move one real €50 k retrofit through it.  
- Log manual ops hours (your time tracker) and calendar days (spreadsheet timestamps).  
- Secure *written statements* from each actor on perceived friction reduction.

---

### 2.4 Desk Research Accents  
*Objective:* Populate gaps and cross-validate field numbers.

| Topic | Source | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| SME loan processing averages | Bundesbank Monthly Report tables | Sets credible baseline |
| Verification SLA norms | ISO 14064 auditing bodies | Validate your 4-day target |
| Subsidy uptake stats | KfW, BAFA annuals | Test monetisation elasticity |

---

## 3 Execution Timeline (Realistic, 30-day Sprint)  

| Week | Deliverable | Success Gate |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Recruit interviewees; send NDA | 6 signed NDAs |
| 1–2 | Conduct interviews; fill questionnaire | 80 % numeric fields populated |
| 2 | Document autopsy; compute baseline cycle-times | ±10 % error margin across cases |
| 3 | Run first concierge pilot opportunity | All seven facets reach “Disbursed” |
| 4 | Collect signed “Before/After” testimonials | ≥ 3 positive endorsements |
| 4 | Synthesize metric slide-deck | Answers ≥ 10/12 narrative questions with numbers |

---

## 4 Analytical Hygiene  

1. **Triangulate**—accept a metric only if field data and desk proxy differ < 25 %; otherwise flag “volatility”.  
2. **Document Assumptions**—e.g., “Bank FTE cost = €70/h”.  
3. **Traceability**—maintain a Google-Drive folder: `/Evidence/Q1_baseline/…` so every stat is audit-reversible.

### Minimum Viable Data Rule  
> *If a data point does not alter the go/no-go decision for investors or pilot partners, it is decorative—postpone it.*

Collect only what bends a strategic lever. Everything else can wait until software crystallises.
