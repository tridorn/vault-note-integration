**Refined Statement of Intent:**

> *“Let’s proceed with Option A. I’d like you to create a structured vendor onboarding questionnaire that captures all data relevant to Flow 3—vendor quotes and impact metadata—formatted for alignment with EU Taxonomy criteria.”*

---

## Objective

Create a **vendor onboarding form** that accomplishes three things simultaneously:

1. **Captures technical and commercial data** needed to structure a quote for SME-financed green upgrades.  
2. **Collects ESG-relevant metadata** aligned with the EU Taxonomy and green loan standards.  
3. **Prepares structured input for bank due diligence** and downstream impact reporting.

## Next Actions for You:

1. **Decide form medium**: Google Form? Airtable? Embedded widget?
2. **Define use-case filters**: Narrow vendor types—e.g., only solar & HVAC for pilot?
3. **Set review SLA**: e.g., Platform promises to qualify vendor within 48h of submission.

Would you like a pre-formatted version of this as an Airtable base or Typeform logic tree? Or shall I help translate this into a slide deck section for vendor recruitment?
