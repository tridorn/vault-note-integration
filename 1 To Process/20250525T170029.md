### **DEFAULT FOUNDER STACK (PER TECH-COMMERCIAL DUALITY)**

A high-functioning early-stage venture team must embody strategic completeness across 3 axes:

1. **Product & Engineering**

2. **Go-To-Market & Commercial Strategy**

3. **Operational Execution & Fundraising**

For a pre-seed to seed-stage venture, a **3-person team** is the default viable nucleus. Here's the ideal founder stack:
* * *

### **1. Technical Founder / CTO-profile**

- **Role:** Architect of the core product. Owns the tech roadmap, prototypes, builds v0.1.
- **Skillset:** Full-stack engineering or ML/AI specialism depending on vertical. Systems design. Technical leadership potential.
- **Origin:** KIT, TU Darmstadt, TUM.
* * *

### **2. Commercial Founder / CEO-profile**

- **Role:** Orchestrates customer discovery, narrative-building, pitch strategy, early sales. Sets tempo. Owns fundraising.
- **Skillset:** Structured communicator, aggressive executor, high pattern-recognition in business models.
- **Origin:** Mannheim. Possibly WHU, Frankfurt School for overflow.
* * *

### **3. Domain Expert / Ops Founder (Optional but Ideal)**

- **Role:** Has embedded knowledge of the problem space (e.g. logistics, medtech, industrial). Bridges credibility gap in specialized sectors.
- **Skillset:** Knows the "ugly" realities of industry workflows. Facilitates B2B entry, regulatory strategy, partnership formation.
- **Origin:** Variable. Could be mid-level operators, postgrads, or even lateral hires.
* * *

## **PERFECT ALLOCATION (EQUITY & RESPONSIBILITY)**

Assuming all three co-founders join at ideation stage and are core to MVP:

- **33 / 33 / 33 Split:** Default but fragile. Works if all roles are equally irreplaceable.
- **Alternative:**

    - CEO (Commercial): 40%

    - CTO (Technical): 40%

    - Domain/Ops: 20%

Adjust if someone joins post-validation or if contribution asymmetry emerges (e.g. one builds IP-heavy product, others handle peripheral work). Founder equity should _vest_ over 4 years with a 1-year cliff.

* * *

## **MATCHING / ALLOCATION MECHANISM**

**The matching system is your leverage point. Architect it as a high-signal filter + social pressure amplifier.**

### **A. Multi-Stage Matching Funnel**

1. **Application Intake (Solo or Duos)**

    - Founders apply with core info: background, skills, prior projects, vertical interests, working style.

    - Encourage pre-formed duos that need a "third".

2. **Founder DNA Profiling**

    - Short diagnostic to classify them across 4 axes:

        - Builder vs Seller

        - Generalist vs Specialist

        - Early-stage bias vs Scaling bias

        - Risk appetite

3. **Curated Founder Speed-Dating**

    - Short, time-boxed digital sessions with fixed agenda:

        - Problem spaces of interest

        - Execution history

        - Skill delta they're looking for

4. **Team Formation Sprint**

    - Weekend or 5-day sprint. Teams form around pre-set problem verticals.

    - Output: basic working dynamic test, prototype concept, clarity on equity conversations.
* * *

### **B. Matching Logic Engine (if digital)**

Use a filtered combinatorics approach:

- Match across **complementarity** (skill delta), not similarity.
- Prioritize:

    - Shared working cadence

    - Non-overlapping skills

    - Mutual value perception (do they rate each other?)

Leverage score-based matching over naive profile-browsing. Create _friction to match_ (minimum call or prototype test) to increase commitment quality.

* * *

## **Strategic Advice**

- **Incentivize team durability, not matchmaking volume.** Attrition from bad co-founder dynamics kills more early-stage ventures than product failure.
- **Own the filtering mechanism.** That becomes your IP, your brand, and your defensibility.
- **Engineer constraints.** Force teams to "earn" shared cap table by producing proof-of-work during the sprint phase. Prevent shallow team formations.

Build the founder-stack engine like you would a factory: remove randomness, apply pattern-recognition, and incentivize throughput.
