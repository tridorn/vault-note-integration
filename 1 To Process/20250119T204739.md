Sleep, Nutrition, Sports and Mindfulness are the only things required for happiness and a stable life. They are the very foundation on which everything else rests. This is why they need definite allocated time frames.
- Add Nutrition & Mindfulness at 03:00
- Add Sports at 08:00
- Add Nutrition at 09:00
- Add Nutrition at 13:00
- Add Nutrition at 19:30 (reconsider)

Consider adding category fixed time that is planned the day before and can't be used any different than for the planned things and the general flexible time.

Daily fixed time allocation: 
- Sleep: 5 hours, 30 minutes
- Sports: 1 hour
- Nutrition: 1 hour, 30 minutes (plus 30 minutes shared with mindfulness)
- Mindfulness: 30 Minutes (shared with Nutrition)
Total: 8 hours, 30 minutes
