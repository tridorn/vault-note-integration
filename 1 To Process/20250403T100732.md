Understood. I’ll identify a concrete, high-impact pilot project tailored to ProCredit’s green lending strategy—focusing on a specific region, SME segment, and upgrade type where urgency and feasibility are highest. I’ll also outline how this pilot could solve an internal bottleneck for them and serve as the launchpad for scalable deployment.

I’ll be back shortly with a full proposal for your review.

# Pilot Proposal: Empowering Kosovo’s SMEs with Green Energy Upgrades

## Background and Rationale

Kosovo’s energy sector faces urgent challenges. The country relies on aging lignite coal plants for *90%* of its electricity ([ProCredit Holding: The ProCredit group achieves another sustainability milestone with the opening of ProEnergy, its own solar park located in Kosovo - ProCredit Bank](https://www.procreditbank.com.al/eng/newsdetails/procredit-holding-the-procredit-group-achieve-123/#:~:text=production%20of%20the%203%20MWp,to%20health%20and%20the%20environment)), giving it the most polluted energy mix in Europe ([ProCredit Bank Kosovo - a driver of green finance and energy transition in the country](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/procredit-bank-kosovo-a-driver-of-green-finance-and-energy-transition-in-the-country/#:~:text=dependence%20on%20fossil%20fuel,how%2C%20and)). This dependence leads to frequent power shortages and blackouts, which **severely impact small businesses.** During a recent energy crisis, for example, a bakery in Pristina had to spend **€100+ per day on diesel for a generator**, versus a normal €300 **per month** electricity bill ([Residents fire up generators as Kosovo energy crisis escalates | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/residents-fire-up-generators-kosovo-energy-crisis-escalates-2021-12-28/#:~:text=PRISTINA%2C%20Dec%2028%20%28Reuters%29%20,since%20authorities%20introduced%20power%20cuts)). This illustrates the crippling costs and lost productivity SMEs suffer under the status quo. 

At the same time, **energy is used very inefficiently in the Western Balkans**. The region’s energy intensity is roughly *three times higher* than the EU average ([action document template (country) empty](https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d47f102a-f02f-4a88-995c-fc0fed773e0e_en#:~:text=Energy%20is%20used%20inefficiently%20in,Balkans%20with%20the%20World%20Bank)), due to outdated infrastructure and equipment. Studies show up to **25% of industrial and commercial energy use could be saved cost-effectively** with modern efficiency measures ([action document template (country) empty](https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d47f102a-f02f-4a88-995c-fc0fed773e0e_en#:~:text=untapped%20energy%20efficiency%20potential%20in,than%20in%20other%20regions%2C%20imposing)). In Kosovo and similar countries, **high and volatile power prices** have already spurred substantial interest in on-site renewable energy solutions ([ProCredit Impact Report 2023](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ProCredit-Impact-Report-2023.pdf?t=1742439383#:~:text=Our%20green%20loan%20portfolio%20is,of%20green%20energy%20transition%20to)). Indeed, 2023 saw a *22% surge* in new solar and wind projects in Kosovo, driven by international investment and policy support ([Kosovo renewable energy Surges by 22% in 2023: A Stunning Breakthrough - PVknowhow.com](https://www.pvknowhow.com/kosovo-renewable-energy-solar-wind-projects/#:~:text=Kosovo%20is%20experiencing%20a%20significant,support%20from%20international%20financial%20institutions)). This momentum reflects a clear opportunity to help SMEs adopt green energy upgrades that cut costs, improve reliability, and reduce carbon emissions.

**ProCredit Bank’s strategic goals** align strongly with these needs. The bank has been a pioneer in green finance across South Eastern and Eastern Europe, achieving over **20% of its loan portfolio in green investments** ([ProCredit Bank to support SMEs in their transition to a low-carbon economy](https://www.green-forum.eu/finance/20240215/procredit-bank-to-support-smes-in-their-transition-to-a-low-carbon-economy-888#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%20years%2C%20we%27ve,towards%20more%20sustainable%20production%20processes)). ProCredit explicitly focuses on SMEs in **energy-intensive sectors like industry and agriculture**, aiming to reduce their carbon footprint ([ProCredit Bank to support SMEs in their transition to a low-carbon economy](https://www.green-forum.eu/finance/20240215/procredit-bank-to-support-smes-in-their-transition-to-a-low-carbon-economy-888#:~:text=towards%20more%20sustainable%20production%20processes)). The group has set a target to raise green loans to *25%* of the portfolio in the medium term ([ProCredit Impact Report 2023](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ProCredit-Impact-Report-2023.pdf?t=1742439383#:~:text=Increasing%20support%20for%20green%20investments,As%20of%202023%2C%20we)) and ultimately reach net-zero financed emissions by 2050 ([Beeck: ProCredit Bank leads by example in sustainability](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/beeck-procredit-leads-by-example-in-sustainability/#:~:text=Christoph%20Beeck%20outlined%20ProCredit%20Bank%E2%80%99s,partners%20in%20sustainability%2C%E2%80%9D%20Beeck%20asserted)) ([Beeck: ProCredit Bank leads by example in sustainability](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/beeck-procredit-leads-by-example-in-sustainability/#:~:text=transition,stringent%20sustainability%20criteria%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20elaborated)). To meet these goals, ProCredit needs scalable, high-impact projects that address the **twin challenges** of **energy inefficiency and energy insecurity** for its SME clients. The following pilot project proposal is designed as a **“quick win”** initiative in Kosovo – one of ProCredit’s core markets – where the need and potential for green SME lending are especially high and immediate.

## Pilot Project Overview

**Project Name:** *Green Energy for Kosovo Bakeries Pilot*

**Focus Country:** **Kosovo** (Western Balkans)

**SME Segment:** **Bakeries and small food producers.** Bakeries are ubiquitous SMEs that consume significant energy for ovens, mixers, refrigeration, and lighting. They are representative of many small businesses facing high energy costs and frequent power disruptions in Kosovo ([Residents fire up generators as Kosovo energy crisis escalates | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/residents-fire-up-generators-kosovo-energy-crisis-escalates-2021-12-28/#:~:text=PRISTINA%2C%20Dec%2028%20%28Reuters%29%20,since%20authorities%20introduced%20power%20cuts)). Supporting bakeries provides a focused pilot segment with relatively uniform needs.

**Green Upgrade Type:** **Rooftop Solar Photovoltaics (PV)** (with battery backup where feasible). Solar was chosen because it directly addresses electricity shortages and high costs. PV systems allow bakeries to generate their own power, **reducing grid dependence and diesel generator use** during outages. Solar is a mature, easily standardized technology with **strong ROI** under Kosovo’s sun conditions (over 220 sunny days/year) ([Solar blossoms - Kosovo 2.0](https://kosovotwopointzero.com/en/solar-blossoms/#:~:text=Solar%20blossoms%20,positioned%20for%20solar%20energy)). ProCredit’s experience financing ~859 MWp of solar capacity across its markets ([ProCredit Impact Report 2023](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ProCredit-Impact-Report-2023.pdf?t=1742439383#:~:text=Through%20renewable%20energy%20project%20financing%2C,compliance%20with%20our%20Exclusion%20List)) demonstrates this is a proven investment. In fact, a similar SME in neighboring Albania (a shoe manufacturer) installed a 0.5 MWp rooftop PV system with ProCredit’s help and **cut its electricity bills by 60% while covering all its energy needs** ([ProCredit Impact Report 2023](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ProCredit-Impact-Report-2023.pdf?t=1742439383#:~:text=optimisation%20of%20operational%20costs%20and,5%20MWp%20rooftop%20solar%20panels)) ([ProCredit Impact Report 2023](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ProCredit-Impact-Report-2023.pdf?t=1742439383#:~:text=the%20help%20of%20ProCredit%20Bank%2C,5%20MWp%20rooftop%20solar%20panels)). This pilot will replicate such success at smaller scale for bakery businesses in Kosovo.

**Internal Pain Point Addressed:** The pilot is explicitly designed to overcome **low throughput and high transaction costs in green SME lending**. Currently, evaluating and verifying each small “green” loan can be costly and slow for the bank – site visits, technical assessments, and bespoke loan terms reduce efficiency. Furthermore, green loans are not yet fully standardized, which limits volume. This pilot will serve as a **template for a streamlined green loan product**, solving key pain points:
- **Standardized appraisal:** By focusing on one sector (bakeries) and one technology (solar PV up to ~30 kW per site), ProCredit can develop a **uniform credit assessment model**. Each project’s expected output and savings will be estimated using a standard tool (based on roof area, solar irradiance, bakery consumption data), instead of lengthy case-by-case analysis.
- **Technical validation efficiency:** The bank will partner with a vetted local solar installer or engineering firm to conduct *batch assessments* and installations. This reduces duplication – one expert team verifies that all pilot sites meet technical criteria (roof condition, connection, etc.) and that systems are installed properly. **Trusted installer reports** will replace costly individual site inspections by loan officers, addressing the “costly verification” issue.
- **Streamlined green eligibility documentation:** Solar PV automatically qualifies as a renewable energy investment (no complex environmental eligibility calculation needed). The pilot will use a one-page standardized form for green loan classification, improving processing speed and consistency (tackling “poor standardization”).
- **Focused marketing and training:** By zeroing in on bakeries, the pilot enables a targeted outreach campaign and specialized training for staff on this product. This focus helps generate a higher volume of applications (addressing “low green loan throughput”) since loan officers know exactly which clients to approach and how to pitch the benefits.

In short, the pilot acts as a **“green loan factory line”** – testing a repeatable process that could dramatically increase the number of small green loans processed with the same resources.

## Pilot Implementation Plan

**Scope and Scale:** The pilot will target **50–100 bakeries across Kosovo**. This sample size is large enough to demonstrate impact and collect meaningful data, yet small enough to closely manage quality. ProCredit’s portfolio in Kosovo includes hundreds of SME clients, so recruiting 50+ willing bakery owners (through branches in Pristina, Prizren, etc.) is feasible. Each participating SME will receive financing to install a **rooftop solar PV system** sized to its needs (typically 5–30 kW per bakery, depending on bakery size and energy use). In total, the pilot is expected to finance roughly **0.5–1 MWp of new solar capacity** across the SME sites.

**Duration:** **18 months total.** This includes approximately **6 months of preparation and recruitment** (marketing to bakery associations, site surveys, procurement of installers), **6–9 months for installations and loan disbursements** (rolling basis), and at least **6 months of post-installation monitoring**. The timeline ensures one full seasonal cycle of data after systems are up and running, while allowing flexibility if permitting or supply chain issues arise.

**Execution Steps:**
1. **Pilot Setup (Months 1–3):** Form a dedicated Green Finance task force at ProCredit Kosovo. Develop standardized loan terms for the solar product (e.g. loans up to EUR 50k, 5-7 year tenor, possible interest subsidy or grant via Green Economy Financing Facility if available). Partner with one or two reputable solar installers. Create simple marketing materials highlighting how **solar saves money and keeps businesses running during power cuts** (with a testimonial from the example bakery case).
2. **Client Outreach & Selection (Months 2–6):** Contact bakery owners in ProCredit’s client base and beyond. Host a workshop or webinar on “Cutting Bakery Energy Costs” in cooperation with the national bakery association. Interested SMEs undergo an initial energy audit – collecting their past electricity bills and outage impacts. Use this data to prioritize about 50 pilot participants (criteria: sufficient roof space, high energy costs, commitment to invest). 
3. **Loan Approval & Installation (Months 4–12):** Process loans using the **streamlined appraisal**. Each loan officer fills in the standardized PV loan template (with projected solar output and payback). The environmental specialist fast-tracks green approval since PV is an approved category. Upon approval, the partnered installer schedules the PV installation for each SME (aiming to complete ~10 installations per month). ProCredit disburses the loan in tranches tied to installation milestones. By Month 12, all 50–100 systems should be live.
4. **Monitoring & Support (Months 6–18):** As systems go live, help clients register for any net metering or feed-in tariff available (Kosovo recently eased solar rules for small systems ([Kosovo* eases requirements for rooftop solar panels for households](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/kosovo-eases-requirements-for-rooftop-solar-panels-for-households/#:~:text=households%20balkangreenenergynews,limited%20to%20just%207%20kW))). Provide training on monitoring their solar production. Collect **monthly performance data** automatically – the installer will set up monitoring portals, giving ProCredit (with client consent) access to generation data. The bank also tracks each bakery’s monthly energy bill and any generator fuel savings. Loan officers periodically check in on clients to ensure systems are operating and troubleshoot any issues (in coordination with the installer for technical support).

**Data Collection:** The pilot will rigorously collect **baseline vs. post-upgrade data** for each SME:
- **Energy consumption and cost:** Monthly electricity usage (kWh) and costs from utility bills before vs. after PV. Diesel generator usage/cost if applicable (e.g. that Pristina bakery could cut out €100/day generator expense ([Residents fire up generators as Kosovo energy crisis escalates | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/residents-fire-up-generators-kosovo-energy-crisis-escalates-2021-12-28/#:~:text=PRISTINA%2C%20Dec%2028%20%28Reuters%29%20,since%20authorities%20introduced%20power%20cuts)) after getting solar+battery).
- **Solar energy production:** kWh generated by each PV system (via inverter monitoring) and percentage of the bakery’s needs met by solar.
- **Outage resilience:** Number of hours of production lost due to power outages, before vs. after (expected to drop with solar and battery backup). This can be logged by the business (with provided templates).
- **Financial performance:** Loan payment vs. energy savings – to verify that savings exceed the monthly loan installment (a key indicator of viability). We expect most bakeries will see immediate net savings. For instance, with current import prices spiking up to €515/MWh in crisis ([Residents fire up generators as Kosovo energy crisis escalates | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/residents-fire-up-generators-kosovo-energy-crisis-escalates-2021-12-28/#:~:text=On%20Friday%2C%20the%20government%20declared,measures%20and%20more%20power%20cuts)), solar power at <€100/MWh levelized cost yields significant savings.
- **CO₂ emissions reduced:** Using Kosovo’s grid emission factor (very high due to coal), estimate emissions avoided per kWh of solar. With 90% coal power, each MWh of solar likely avoids ~0.9 tons of CO₂ ([ProCredit Holding: The ProCredit group achieves another sustainability milestone with the opening of ProEnergy, its own solar park located in Kosovo - ProCredit Bank](https://www.procreditbank.com.al/eng/newsdetails/procredit-holding-the-procredit-group-achieve-123/#:~:text=production%20of%20the%203%20MWp,to%20health%20and%20the%20environment)). This will feed into ProCredit’s impact metrics (tCO₂ reduction).
- **Loan processing metrics:** Time from application to disbursement (to compare against typical SME loans), and staff hours spent per loan. This will measure the efficiency gains from standardization. 

All data will be analyzed at pilot end to evaluate outcomes and refine the approach.

## Expected Outcomes and Benefits

By the conclusion of the pilot, we anticipate the following **measurable outcomes**:

- **Reduced Energy Costs for SMEs:** Each participating bakery is expected to cut grid electricity consumption by **50–70%**, yielding **20–50% lower energy bills** (depending on system size and self-consumption ratio). For example, a mid-sized bakery with a €500 monthly bill might save ~€250 per month. The Imes Albania case (60% cost reduction with solar) is a strong precedent ([ProCredit Impact Report 2023](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ProCredit-Impact-Report-2023.pdf?t=1742439383#:~:text=optimisation%20of%20operational%20costs%20and,5%20MWp%20rooftop%20solar%20panels)) ([ProCredit Impact Report 2023](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ProCredit-Impact-Report-2023.pdf?t=1742439383#:~:text=the%20help%20of%20ProCredit%20Bank%2C,5%20MWp%20rooftop%20solar%20panels)). Collectively, the pilot’s 50–100 bakeries should save on the order of **€100,000+ per year** in energy costs, improving their profitability and competitiveness.

- **Improved Business Resilience:** Thanks to on-site generation, SMEs will be less vulnerable to Kosovo’s grid outages and energy price spikes. We expect a significant drop in generator fuel expenses and outage-related downtime. For instance, if the pilot had been in place during the 2021 crisis, that one bakery could have avoided most of its **€100/day diesel costs** during blackouts ([Residents fire up generators as Kosovo energy crisis escalates | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/residents-fire-up-generators-kosovo-energy-crisis-escalates-2021-12-28/#:~:text=PRISTINA%2C%20Dec%2028%20%28Reuters%29%20,since%20authorities%20introduced%20power%20cuts)). Going forward, participants can maintain production through moderate load-shedding periods, protecting jobs and income.

- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Avoided:** The pilot should install ~0.5–1 MWp of solar, generating roughly **600–1,200 MWh/year** of clean electricity (assuming ~1,200 kWh/kWp annual yield). Given Kosovo’s heavy coal baseline, this equates to roughly **500–1,000 tons of CO₂ emissions avoided per year**. In broader context, it’s a step toward Kosovo’s goal of increasing renewables from ~7% to 35% of supply ([Kosovo Opposition Parties Pledge Coal, Gas Power Plants and ...](https://prishtinainsight.com/31573-2-mag/#:~:text=Kosovo%20Opposition%20Parties%20Pledge%20Coal%2C,currently%20in%20the%20gross)). ProCredit can publicize this climate impact in its reports, contributing to the group’s SDG and Paris Agreement commitments.

- **Higher Throughput of Green Loans:** Internally, ProCredit Kosovo will have issued ~50+ standardized green loans in under a year – a marked increase in **green loan throughput**. By tracking internal KPIs, we expect to show that the **average processing time per loan drops** (due to the template approach), and staff can handle more loans in parallel. The pilot will also likely have **zero NPLs** (non-performing loans), since energy savings boost borrowers’ ability to repay. A successful repayment record will encourage line staff and management that scaling up green lending is profitable and secure.

- **Template for Standardized Green Products:** Perhaps the most valuable outcome is a **replicable model**. The pilot will produce a tested credit appraisal template, documentation checklist, and partnership model (with installers) that can be **reused for future green finance programs**. It essentially creates a **“Green Bakery Loan” product that could be expanded to other markets or adapted to similar SME segments.** Moreover, the data collected (actual savings, default rates, process metrics) will provide ProCredit with hard evidence to refine risk parameters (possibly allowing slightly higher debt service ratios given demonstrated energy savings, etc.). This know-how strengthens ProCredit’s position as the region’s **leader in SME green finance** ([Beeck: ProCredit Bank leads by example in sustainability](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/beeck-procredit-leads-by-example-in-sustainability/#:~:text=Highlighting%20the%20bank%E2%80%99s%20broader%20vision%2C,stringent%20sustainability%20criteria%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20elaborated)).

Each of these outcomes will be documented in a **pilot report** at the end of the project, including testimonials from bakery owners and before/after case studies.

## Scaling and Expansion Plan

If the pilot proves successful, ProCredit can **scale up and replicate** it in several dimensions:

- **Nationwide Rollout in Kosovo:** Expand the program to **hundreds of SMEs** across diverse sectors in Kosovo. After bakeries, the next targets could be **hospitality (restaurants, small hotels)** and **agri-processing** (dairy farms, mills), which also suffer from energy unreliability and could benefit from solar or energy-efficient equipment. The standardized approach would be similar – perhaps creating tailored loan products (e.g. a “solar+freezer upgrade” package for dairy cooperatives). With Kosovo’s enormous efficiency potential and need to cut coal reliance, scaling green investments is both economically and socially imperative ([ProCredit Bank Kosovo - a driver of green finance and energy transition in the country](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/procredit-bank-kosovo-a-driver-of-green-finance-and-energy-transition-in-the-country/#:~:text=dependence%20on%20fossil%20fuel,how%2C%20and)) ([action document template (country) empty](https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d47f102a-f02f-4a88-995c-fc0fed773e0e_en#:~:text=of%20total%20household%20energy%2C%2040,costs%20on%20the%20Western%20Balkans)).

- **Replication in Other ProCredit Countries:** The pilot learnings can be transferred to other Western Balkan markets and Eastern Europe. Many ProCredit operating countries (e.g. **Serbia, North Macedonia, Bosnia, Moldova, Ukraine**) have *similar SME energy challenges*: outdated equipment, high energy intensity, and rising energy costs. For instance, Serbia’s energy intensity and inefficiencies mirror Kosovo’s (the Western Balkans as a whole could cost-effectively save ~35% of household and ~25% of industry energy use) ([action document template (country) empty](https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d47f102a-f02f-4a88-995c-fc0fed773e0e_en#:~:text=untapped%20energy%20efficiency%20potential%20in,than%20in%20other%20regions%2C%20imposing)). A **scaled program** could be launched in Serbia focusing on another segment like small manufacturers or commercial buildings with insulation/HVAC upgrades. Likewise, **Ukraine** – once the security situation allows more investment – is a prime candidate to extend such green financing. Ukrainian SMEs are already “rushing to install” solar panels and batteries to achieve energy independence amid grid attacks ([Ukrainians find new energy sources to beat blackouts as winter arrives | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainians-find-new-energy-sources-beat-blackouts-winter-arrives-2024-12-03/#:~:text=including%20solar%20panels%2C%20batteries%20and,small%20gas%20turbine%20generators)) ([Ukrainians find new energy sources to beat blackouts as winter arrives | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainians-find-new-energy-sources-beat-blackouts-winter-arrives-2024-12-03/#:~:text=accumulating%20batteries%20and%20inverters)). ProCredit Ukraine could replicate the model to help rebuild a greener, more resilient economy.

- **Product Diversification:** The success of a solar-focused pilot can open doors to financing other **concrete upgrade types** in a standardized way. For example, ProCredit could develop a similar pilot for **energy-efficient HVAC or insulation upgrades for SMEs in Bulgaria or Romania**, where heating/cooling costs are a major pain point. The pilot’s methodology (focus on one tech + one segment + streamlined processes) can be applied to, say, *retrofitting small hotels with heat pumps and insulation*. This addresses both winter gas dependency and summer cooling efficiency, with the same kind of measured outcomes (energy saved, CO₂ reduced). Having multiple proven “product packages” (solar PV, efficient HVAC, etc.) allows ProCredit to significantly broaden its green finance portfolio.

- **Larger Financing Facilities:** With pilot data in hand, ProCredit can approach development banks (EBRD, EIB, Green Climate Fund) for **scaling capital**. For instance, an expansion could be bundled into a dedicated credit line or blended finance facility – much like the existing Green Economy Financing Facilities – to support hundreds of SMEs. Donor grant components (e.g. **cashback incentives** like those EBRD provided in Georgia’s solar program ([Eco-Friendly Vision of ProCredit Bank](https://unglobalcompact.ge/sustainability-spotlight/en/prokredit-bankis-ekomegobruli-khedva/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20we%20placed%20a,solar%20energy%20over%20the%20years)) ([Eco-Friendly Vision of ProCredit Bank](https://unglobalcompact.ge/sustainability-spotlight/en/prokredit-bankis-ekomegobruli-khedva/#:~:text=planned%20a%20financing%20program%20for,solar%20energy%20over%20the%20years))) could be incorporated to encourage even more uptake. By showing strong pilot results, ProCredit strengthens its case to secure such support and perhaps negotiate **lower cost of funds** for green lending, making the business model even more attractive.

In summary, this pilot is designed not as a one-off, but as **the foundation for a scalable program**. It tackles an urgent need in Kosovo – helping small businesses survive and thrive by cutting energy costs – in a way that also generates **valuable lessons for the entire ProCredit network**. As the bank’s Head of Sustainable Development noted, *“supporting clients’ green investments not only helps the environment but improves their competitiveness”* ([ProCredit Bank to support SMEs in their transition to a low-carbon economy](https://www.green-forum.eu/finance/20240215/procredit-bank-to-support-smes-in-their-transition-to-a-low-carbon-economy-888#:~:text=our%20loan%20portfolio%20to%20support,towards%20more%20sustainable%20production%20processes)). By focusing on a high-need country, a concrete technology, and a specific SME niche, this project maximizes the chances of success and learning. 

ProCredit can then confidently expand these green financing solutions, **standardizing them across the region to drive a low-carbon transition for SMEs** – all while growing the bank’s green loan portfolio and meeting strategic targets ([ProCredit Impact Report 2023](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ProCredit-Impact-Report-2023.pdf?t=1742439383#:~:text=Increasing%20support%20for%20green%20investments,As%20of%202023%2C%20we)) ([Beeck: ProCredit Bank leads by example in sustainability](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/beeck-procredit-leads-by-example-in-sustainability/#:~:text=transition,stringent%20sustainability%20criteria%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20elaborated)). This pilot is the first step on that path, offering both immediate impact for Kosovo’s economy and a blueprint for sustainable growth in ProCredit’s markets.
