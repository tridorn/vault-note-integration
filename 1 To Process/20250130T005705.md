To integrate the **flow of phases**—*initiation, pre-production, production, post-production, pre-deployment, launch, and post-launch*—into a universal folder structure without making it overly rigid, we can organize the project space so that each phase is lightly accounted for, ensuring flexibility across different project types. Below, I provide a more detailed and adaptable folder structure that balances your request for phase integration while remaining suitable for **any kind of project**.

### Generalized Folder Structure with Light Integration of Phases

```

│   ├── /production         # Core content creation or coding documentation (production)
│   ├── /post-production    # Edits, revisions, refinements (post-production)
│   ├── /pre-deployment     # Testing reports, QA, final checks (pre-deployment)
│   ├── /launch             # Launch documentation, marketing materials (launch)
│   └── /post-launch        # Performance data, post-launch analysis, feedback (post-launch)
├── /src                    # Primary work, separated by content type

### **Folder Details & Phase Flow Integration**

**`/docs` Folder (Phase Integration)**:  
The **`/docs`** folder encapsulates documentation and planning relevant to each project phase. Each subfolder represents a phase but is flexible enough to handle any kind of project, whether it’s software, media creation, or general content.

1. **`/initiation`**: 
	- Early-stage documents like proposals, briefs, initial brainstorming notes, research, or stakeholder interviews.
	- This would account for research and strategy for content-heavy projects, or feature specs and user stories for software.

2. **`/pre-production`**:
	- Includes wireframes, blueprints, storyboards, or technical specifications. For a website, this might be architecture diagrams; for video, it might be shot lists or script drafts.
	- For writing-heavy projects, this would include outlines, article structures, or initial drafts.

3. **`/production`**:
	- Active working files such as source code, content drafts, or production scripts. This is where the core work happens.
	- Code development documentation (e.g., README.md), content briefs for editors, or video shoot logs could be housed here.

4. **`/post-production`**:
	- Revisions, editing logs, or feedback rounds for refining the output. 
	- For software, this might be code refactoring documentation; for media, this includes video editing notes, final drafts of articles, or design revisions.

5. **`/pre-deployment`**:
	- Testing, QA documentation, and final content approval steps.
	- For coding projects, this includes test reports, while for media projects, this would account for final copyediting or post-editing audio mixes.

6. **`/launch`**:
	- Launch documentation and materials, including any marketing plans, social media drafts, or final deployment instructions.
	- Software release notes, product rollout plans, or media distribution strategies.

7. **`/post-launch`**:
	- Feedback, analytics, and performance reviews. Collecting audience/user feedback, sales reports, or bug reports for continuous improvement.
	- For writing or content projects, this might be reader analytics or post-publishing editorial notes.

**`/src` Folder**:  
This is the **core workspace** where the actual project files reside, organized by type. The folder keeps all the development and creation work modular while being phase-agnostic. You can focus on what’s being created, whether it’s code, media, or content, without the phase dictating the structure.

- **`/code`**: Holds the main development code. In case of a content-focused project, this might include the scripts that automate repetitive processes or website infrastructure.
- **`/content`**: Houses textual content—articles, research, or general written work.
- **`/media`**: Contains editable visual and audio files. For video production, this might store project files (e.g., `.psd` for Photoshop or `.prproj` for Premiere Pro).
- **`/scripts`**: This folder supports the automation and workflows, including deployment scripts, or smaller Python/JS scripts to streamline processes.

**`/assets` Folder**:  
This folder is for **static files**, including images, audio, and videos, which may not necessarily need to be version-controlled in Git but can be linked. When files are hosted externally (for large assets), placeholder files in `/assets` can link to the external storage.

**`/config` Folder**:  
This holds all **configuration files** for the project, which are medium-specific, ensuring that the environment for testing and deployment is consistently set across different platforms and collaborators.

- Examples: **`config.json`** for software settings, **`.env`** files, or **Adobe project configurations** for design work.

**`/build` Folder**:  
This is where the **compiled output** of your project resides. Whether this is binary executables, compiled code, or final media products, the build folder is for storing deliverables.

- For a video production project, this could be your **final video render**.
- For a software project, it holds the **final compiled binaries**.

**`/deploy` Folder**:  
This contains **deployment scripts** and configurations related to shipping the final product. You can include deployment documentation here for media distribution (e.g., platform release guidelines) or infrastructure deployment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes scripts for a web app).

**`/tests` Folder**:  
All **test cases** and **quality assurance** measures go here. This folder would contain unit tests for code, usability tests for UX-heavy projects, or even checklists for final media revisions.

### **How The Phases Flow Across This Structure**

- **Initiation**: Work begins in `/docs/initiation`, with brainstorming, research, and high-level planning. 
- **Pre-Production**: This moves to `/docs/pre-production` as designs, storyboards, or technical specs are solidified, setting up the core project in `/src`.
- **Production**: Work actively happens in `/src` (e.g., coding in `/src/code`, content writing in `/src/content`, media creation in `/src/media`). Concurrent documentation about the production process is stored in `/docs/production`.
- **Post-Production**: Refinements and final edits are done in `/src` or reflected in `/docs/post-production` with feedback logs or revision histories.
- **Pre-Deployment**: Final tests, QA, or reviews are prepared in `/docs/pre-deployment` while output files are stored in `/build`.
- **Launch**: Launch documentation is tracked in `/docs/launch` and deployment files/scripts are executed from `/deploy`.
- **Post-Launch**: The performance of the project is recorded in `/docs/post-launch`, allowing for future iteration.

---

### **General Adaptation for Any Kind of Project**

This structure is inherently adaptable because it is **phase-independent**—meaning the core working directories (`/src`, `/assets`, `/docs`) remain flexible enough to suit any project:

- **For a software development project**:
	- Focus is on `/src/code` for development, `/docs` for technical and user documentation, `/build` for compiled binaries, and `/deploy` for server-side deployment configurations.

- **For a media production project**:
	- Work happens across `/src/media` for video, audio, or graphics production, while `/docs/pre-production` holds storyboards, `/assets` manages linked resources, and `/deploy` may house publishing strategies.

- **For a content-heavy project**:
	- You’d work mainly in `/src/content` for article drafts, with `/docs/pre-production` holding outlines and `/assets` storing supplementary images or audio. Final published articles would be distributed via `/deploy`.

This folder structure, lightly reflecting the flow of phases, is designed to be modular and scalable for **any kind of project**. Each phase is represented without being strictly forced, allowing flexibility in how you progress through the project lifecycle.
