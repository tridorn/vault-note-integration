To make the dual-core system operationally sovereign and strategically sharp, you must define each entity by its **raison d'être**, **operational workflow**, and **position in the venture formation timeline**. Below is the delineation--clean, functional, and role-specific.

* * *

## I. **Reason of Being: Core Purpose**

|  | **Startup Factory (gGmbH)** | **Venture Studio (Eupator UG)** | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Core mandate** | Institutionalise a **trusted public funnel** for high-quality pre-startup projects | Build, fund, and scale high-value startups with proprietary control | 
| **Reason for existing** | Legitimise the conversion of public research and tech talent into spinout-ready ventures | Own the execution, own the equity, deliver investor-grade companies | 
| **Main success metric** | Number of validated, venture-grade projects delivered per year | Equity value captured across portfolio, capital raised, exits | 
* * *

## II. **Workflow: Who Does What, When**

### **1. Upstream Scouting & Intake (Factory)**

- Identifies PhDs, postdocs, researchers, and students with promising tech, prototypes, or problem definitions.
- Sources projects via direct university liaison, events, academic scouting, and faculty chairs.
- Screens applications and selects 8--12 teams/project candidates per cohort.

**Studio:** not involved.
* * *

### **2. Validation Sprint (Factory)**

- Runs a 6-week pre-startup program:

    - Assigns a venture architect per project.

    - Provides €5--10k prototyping budget.

    - Coaches on customer discovery, MVP, and co-founder search (usually bringing in MBAs/business students).
- Tracks KPIs, runs midpoint and final review boards.
- 30--60% of projects are killed before sprint ends.

**Studio:** may observe, suggest founders, but does not control.
* * *

### **3. Graduation & Option Interface (Factory → Studio)**

- Validation committee marks a project as **spinout-ready**.
- IP prepared under standardised licence terms (royalty-free until Series A, 1% net sales cap thereafter).
- Studio receives exclusive **60-day option** to spin out the project.

**Decision point:**

- Studio triggers spinout → company formation begins.
- Studio passes → Factory either archives the project or opens access to other investors (open auction).
* * *

### **4. Spinout Formation (Studio)**

- Incorporates the company (UG/GmbH).
- Assigns internal team (venture lead, product, legal).
- Transfers IP licence from Factory.
- Takes 15--25% equity stake (via convertible or direct equity).
- Co-founder team signs standard SAFE or shareholding agreement.
- Initial capital deployed (studio-funded or via angel network).

**Factory:** exits active involvement, remains a reporting stakeholder.
* * *

### **5. Execution & Venture Building (Studio)**

- Studio drives venture execution over 3--12 months:

    - MVP development.

    - Hiring.

    - Fundraising support.

    - GTM strategy.

    - Legal and financial infrastructure.
- Tracks monthly KPIs, prepares for seed round.

**Factory:** only passive; may track impact KPIs for reporting.
* * *

### **6. External Capital / Exit (Studio)**

- Studio supports venture through pre-seed, seed, and Series A.
- May launch Opportunity Fund to invest follow-ons.
- Captures equity gains on exits, secondaries, or liquidity events.

**Factory:** claims no equity, no upside. May report headline success metrics to city/universities.

## IV. **Role Differentiation Summary**

| Domain | Factory | Studio | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Source** | Public: professors, students, researchers | Private: studio hypothesis, market pain, trends | 
| **Form** | Projects & pre-startup teams | Incorporated ventures | 
| **Owns what** | Nothing | Company equity (15--25%) | 
| **Funds what** | Validation sprints, founder stipends, event ops (public grant) | MVP, legal setup, early salaries (private) | 
| **Decision velocity** | Board-based, slow (institutional) | Operator-driven, fast (founder-led) | 
| **Brand optics** | Civic, neutral, academic | Sharp, venture-grade, execution-focused | 
* * *

## V. **Where They Connect (and Why It Works)**

| Interface Point | Description | Why It's Crucial | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **MoU / IP Option Contract** | Factory gives studio first look, studio gets exclusive build rights | Ensures trust + proprietary pipeline | 
| **Sprint Reporting** | Studio gets early insight into teams, can pre-select interest | Creates continuity from discovery to build | 
| **Spinout SOP** | Standard legal and financial templates across all startups | Accelerates formation, prevents chaos | 
| **Shared CRM / Database** | Factory logs intake, Studio logs progress | Metrics flow up; investor story and grant story stay coherent | 
| **Talent Loop** | MBAs from Studio pool become co-founders in Factory projects | Cross-pollinates both ends of the funnel | 
* * *

## VI. **Summary**

- The **Factory is a civic-intellectual funnel**: trusted, neutral, academically validated.
- The **Studio is a sovereign execution node**: fast, capitalised, operator-controlled.

They occupy **non-overlapping phases** of the venture lifecycle.  
They operate on **non-overlapping funding models**.  
They serve **complementary stakeholders**, and only together do they form a complete, high-functioning innovation engine.

You don't build one. You **operate the interface** between both. That's your edge.
