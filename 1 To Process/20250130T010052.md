# Section for Goals/Questions in Cornell Note-Taking System

"Let us revisit the Cornell note-taking system. I read somewhere that one could optionally add a fourth column at the top for the name of the material being summarized. This made me wonder: could this fourth section be extended to include one's goals and the questions they seek to answer?"

Absolutely, the idea of a fourth section at the top of your Cornell notes can be an excellent addition, transforming the system into an even more powerful tool for intentional learning. By using this section to include **goals**, **questions**, and **focus points**, you not only direct your note-taking process but also enhance the depth of your engagement with the material. This can significantly improve how you approach content and structure your thoughts.

### 1. **Purpose Of the Fourth Section (Header)**

The header section would be used to set the *intention* for the note-taking session. This serves as a mental framework, ensuring that you engage with the material actively and with purpose. It adds a new dimension to Cornell’s structure by connecting the act of note-taking with your **specific objectives** or **learning goals**.

This would transform Cornell notes from being primarily reactive (writing down what you hear or read) to proactive (guiding yourself through the material with predetermined goals and questions).

### 2. **What Could the Fourth Section Contain?**

Here’s how the fourth section at the top of your Cornell notes could be structured:

#### **a) Title (Context)**

- This is the basic identifying information about the content: the book title, lecture topic, or article name. It ensures you always know the context when revisiting your notes.
- **Example**:

```
Title: "Deep Work by Cal Newport"
```

#### **b) Goal/Objective**

- This is where you write your specific goal for the session. What do you want to accomplish? Are you trying to learn a specific concept, understand a theory, or extract practical strategies?
- Writing down your goal ensures that you stay focused on extracting the most relevant information and tailoring your notes toward your purpose.
- **Example**:

```
Goal: Understand the principles of deep work and how to apply them to improve my productivity.
```

#### **c) Key Questions**

- Before engaging with the material, jot down **specific questions** you want answered. This transforms your note-taking into an **active discovery process** and primes your mind to be alert for relevant answers during the reading or lecture.
- These questions can include both general and specific inquiries you have about the topic, and they help ensure that you're always looking for answers rather than passively absorbing information.
- **Example**:

```
Questions:
- How can I create more focused blocks of time for deep work?
- What are the biggest obstacles to deep work in a modern work environment?
```

### 3. **Advantages Of Using a Fourth Section for Goals and Questions**

#### a) **Increased Focus**

- By identifying goals and questions upfront, your note-taking becomes a targeted exercise. You avoid being overwhelmed by unnecessary details and stay laser-focused on what matters most to you.
- This prevents the common issue of overloading your notes with information that you won’t revisit or find useful later.

#### b) **Personalized Learning**

- Every learner has different needs and objectives. Adding goals and questions makes the note-taking process more **personalized**, as it aligns the material with your specific interests and gaps in knowledge.
- This also ties into the **Processing Layer** (from the Input → Process → Output system), as you begin thinking critically even before you start taking notes.

#### c) **More Intentional Review**

- When you return to your notes later, the top section reminds you of what you were trying to achieve. You can check whether the material provided answers to your questions or whether further research is needed.
- This also allows you to check how well the notes served their intended purpose and whether your understanding has evolved.

### 4. **Example Of an Extended Cornell Note-Taking System with a Fourth Section**

Let’s walk through an example of how the extended Cornell system might work, using a lecture or book on **time management**.

#### **1. Fourth Section (Header)**

```
Title: Time Management Strategies (Lecture)
Goal: Learn practical strategies for improving time allocation in my workday.
Questions:
- How do I prioritize tasks effectively?
- What techniques exist to reduce distractions?
```

#### **2. Main Notes (Input)**

```
- The Pomodoro technique: 25-minute work blocks followed by short breaks.
- Eisenhower matrix: Tasks are prioritized based on urgency and importance.
- Reducing distractions: Environmental changes (phone in another room, workspace optimization).
```

#### **3. Cue Column (Processing)**

```
- Cue: How could I adapt the Pomodoro technique to fit longer blocks of focused time?
- Cue: What are examples of non-urgent but important tasks I often overlook?
- Cue: What can I change in my current environment to eliminate distractions?
```

#### **4. Summary (Output)**

```
The Pomodoro technique is helpful for short tasks but may not suit deep work. The Eisenhower matrix can help clarify task prioritization, and I need to experiment with workspace adjustments to improve focus.
Next step: Try the Eisenhower matrix to organize my next AMU mission.
```

### 5. **How This Fits Into the Input → Process → Output System**

The addition of a fourth section at the top, for goals and questions, **enhances the Input layer** of the system. Instead of passively waiting to process material after the fact, you start with **critical engagement**. It encourages a mindset where you are already filtering the material through the lens of your personal objectives and inquiries.

- **Input Layer**: The fourth section primes your mind, focusing your attention on specific goals. As you take notes (Main Notes), you capture the content that serves these goals.
- **Processing Layer**: The cue column aligns with the Processing layer, where you reflect on and interrogate the material further, driven by the questions and objectives you started with.
- **Output Layer**: The summary allows you to assess how well the material answered your initial questions and provided you with actionable insights aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion

By adding a fourth section at the top of the Cornell note-taking system, you add a proactive dimension to your note-taking. Including your goals and key questions ensures that you are **guided by purpose**, leading to more intentional, focused, and meaningful engagement with the material. This enhanced version of the Cornell system fits seamlessly into the **Input → Process → Output** framework, making it a more effective tool for active learning and personal growth.
