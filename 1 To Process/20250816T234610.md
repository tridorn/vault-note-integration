title: 1. Distinguish the types of leadership you owe each

This is the core design problem: how you personally co-steer two interlocking but different beasts:

- your business venture (HoldCo/studio) = operating engine, capital allocation, ventures, execution discipline.
- your "heart project" (Dornhelm Institute/Council) = civilisational ideas, convenings, influence, long horizon.

  

Rational assessment â†’ you need to balance time, legitimacy, and control so neither starves.

* * *

# 1. Distinguish the types of leadership you owe each

  

Business HoldCo (venture engine):

- Needs operational steering (capital allocation, hiring key operators, monitoring performance).
- Very execution-heavy, detail-oriented.
- Success = cash flow, repeatable venture playbooks.

  

Dornhelm (heart project):

- Needs intellectual + convening leadership (ideas, writing, thought-architecture, network orchestration).
- Much less day-to-day ops if you structure right.
- Success = influence, legitimacy, and shaping discourse/coalitions.

  

ðŸ‘‰ The skillsets are different. You should be the "operating allocator" in HoldCo and the "editor-convener" in Dornhelm.

* * *

# 2. Build complementary management models

  

### For HoldCo (business side)

- You = Capital Allocator + CEO at the start.
- Build a Portfolio Ops team early (finance, legal, recruiting, GTM) â†’ they take daily load.
- Add a Managing Director/COO in Year 2--3 â†’ runs ops cadence, so you can focus on allocation + strategy.
- Eventually, you can chair HoldCo's Board, not run daily ops.

  

### For Dornhelm (heart side)

- You = Editor-at-Large + Council Convener.
- Start by writing yourself (essays/briefs), then build an editorial team (1 researcher + 1 comms/producer).
- Appoint a Policy Director in Year 2 â†’ runs Institute's cadence (briefs, events).
- Appoint a Network Head for the Council â†’ runs convenings, coalition logistics.
- Eventually, you can be "Chief Steward" / figurehead, writing 2--3 essays a year, convening the annual Forum, mentoring fellows.
* * *

# 3. Co-steering in practice: the calendar

  

HoldCo

- Weekly: 2--3 ops check-ins (finance, portfolio reviews, venture build progress).
- Monthly: Capital allocation committee (with your CFO + ops lead).
- Quarterly: Board review + kill/scale decisions.

  

Dornhelm

- Weekly: 1 content/editorial block (essay writing, idea shaping).
- Biweekly: 1 Council check-in (prep salons, coalition management).
- Quarterly: Publish a Brief, convene a salon.
- Annually: Flagship Forum.

  

ðŸ‘‰ That means ~60% of your working week goes to HoldCo early (more ops-heavy), ~20--25% to Dornhelm writing/convening, ~15% to learning/networking. Over time, the split shifts as you delegate ops.

* * *

# 4. The secret:

# Shared Services + Brand separation
- Finance/legal/talent/data = one central ops stack under HoldCo. Serves both HoldCo and Dornhelm.
- But brand separation = critical. Dornhelm is its own name, aesthetic, website. Even if it's just a program inside HoldCo legally, don't blur it externally.
* * *

# 5. Control mechanisms you keep personally

- HoldCo: you hold majority equity/control; you chair capital allocation.
- Dornhelm: you are the founding Editor-at-Large; your name (Tristan Dornhelm) anchors legitimacy; later you can transfer operations to a Director, but you remain the intellectual steward.
* * *

# 6. General considerations (risks & mitigations)

- Risk: Spreading thin.

â†’ Solution: build ops delegation early; use your calendar as a guardrail (e.g. fixed "Institute writing block" weekly).

- Risk: Dornhelm becomes seen as mere corporate lobbying.

â†’ Solution: brand separation, independent advisory circle, and principled (but broad) mission language.

- Risk: Business side underperforms because you get pulled into ideas.

â†’ Solution: commit to a strong CFO/COO early at HoldCo; measure with simple quarterly KPIs.

- Risk: Heart project fizzles because you starve it.

â†’ Solution: lock a minimum cadence (e.g. 1 essay/month, 1 salon/quarter) into your calendar. Better to do less but consistent.

* * *

# 7. Rational build-up timeline

  

Year 0--1:

- You run HoldCo hands-on.
- Dornhelm: start as personal project inside HoldCo â†’ 1 essay/month, 2 salons, small brand presence.
- Hire RA + ops support to give Dornhelm "legs."

  

Year 2--3:

- Hire COO/MD for HoldCo; you shift to capital allocation.
- Dornhelm: spin into lightweight nonprofit shell (Institute), hire Policy Director. Council remains informal.
- Cadence: quarterly briefs, annual Forum.

  

Year 4--5:

- You chair HoldCo board, not day-to-day.
- Dornhelm has Policy Director + Network Head. You focus on thought leadership + convenings.
- Possibly add stewardship vehicle (foundation/purpose trust) to lock mission.
* * *

âœ… Summary:

- You co-steer by role separation: operator/allocator in business, editor/convener in the movement.
- You manage by building ops infrastructure + delegation early.
- You protect both by brand separation but shared services.
- You schedule explicitly: 60/25/15 split at the start, shifting towards more Dornhelm as HoldCo matures.

Would you like me to sketch a visual "time allocation roadmap" (Year 0--5, showing how your role shifts between ops, capital allocation, and thought leadership)? That way you can see the balance evolving at a glance.
