Here's a clear, rational way to think about your "startup factory" and the angle it should take.

  

# The strategic fork in the road

  

There are four archetypes you're circling:

1. Venture Studio (build-to-own or build-to-spin)

You originate ideas, assemble founding teams, and provide shared services. Equity-heavy, high variance, slow to cash flow but massive upside if a few hit.

2. Evergreen HoldCo / Compounder (Berkshire-esque, PE-lite)

You buy or build durable, cash-generative businesses, redeploy free cash flow into more acquisitions or internal ventures. Lower variance, compounding engine, control matters.

3. Asset Manager (hedge fund / PE / VC)

You raise external LP capital, earn fees and carry. Capital-light at the GP level, but you own less of the underlying businesses; your edge must be repeatable selection and access.

4. Sovereign-style Allocator (Oil Fund vibe)

Giant, diversified allocator across asset classes. Great for stability and scale--but it presumes enormous, low-cost, long-duration capital. Not a realistic starting point.

  

# Recommendation: build a

# Compounder Studio

  

Blend (1) and (2): an evergreen HoldCo that creates and acquires businesses, with a focused venture studio arm that spins up newco bets where you have a true edge. Default stance is long-term hold, with optional liquidity (structured partial exits, minority sell-downs) rather than routine full divestitures.

  

Why this angle:

- It aligns with your goal: "repeatable playbook + real-world business value."
- It creates a cash-flow flywheel to fund more shots on goal without perpetual fundraising.
- It gives you control where it matters (platform assets), but retains flexibility to co-invest or syndicate when it helps speed and scale.

  

# How it makes money (stacked engine)

1. Operating cash flows from controlled businesses (dividends upstream to HoldCo).

2. Capital gains from selective partial exits or secondaries--not the default.

3. Co-investment vehicles (deal-by-deal or an Opportunity Fund) for larger follow-ons; you can earn small fees/carry without becoming a fee-first asset manager.

4. Shared services margin (internal transfer pricing) that's modest but drives quality and standardization.

  

# Control: business first, money second (with stages)

- Stage-gated control model.

    - At formation (studio-led): HoldCo 45--60%, Founders 30--40%, ESOP 10--15%.

    - On follow-ons: pre-set dilution bands; HoldCo seeks to maintain ≥50% voting in "platform" companies and is fine with 20--40% influential stakes in "adjacent" bets.
- Governance: board majority (or at least vetoes) for platformcos on capital allocation, M&A, and CEO changes.
- Golden share--like protections for mission-critical IP or brand.

  

# Portfolio design & capital allocation

- Focus over sprawl. Pick 1--2 verticals where you have unfair advantage (distribution, data, regulatory know-how, or a captive demand channel). The studio model only scales when distribution is repeatable.
- 70/20/10 policy.

    - 70% capital to doubling down on proven winners (unit economics met).

    - 20% to new studio builds (2--4 per year to start).

    - 10% opportunistic buys (bolt-ons, carve-outs, distressed tuck-ins).
- Hurdle rules (simple, mechanical):

    - New studio builds: aim for 2.5--3.0× MOIC potential inside 5--7 years; kill quickly if milestones miss.

    - Buy & build: ≥15% unlevered IRR, path to 25%+ with synergies.

  

# Spin vs hold?

- Default: hold. You're building a compounding machine.
- Release valve: enable partial liquidity (e.g., sell 10--30% to a strategic or growth fund) at de-risked inflection points to recycle cash.
- Full exit triggers: structural market change, broken moat, or a buyer willing to pay far above your intrinsic value estimate.

  

# Operating system (your repeatable playbook)

- Shared Services: recruiting, GTM, performance marketing, finance, legal, data/ML, SRE/DevOps, procurement, revenue ops, and CFO-as-a-service.
- Pattern libraries: pricing playbooks, onboarding flows, ICP/segmentation templates, sales compensation frameworks, data schemas, vendor master lists, partner contracts.
- Risk & compliance: central vendor risk reviews, security baseline (SOC2/ISO as a service), and regulatory checklists (especially for "real-world" sectors).
- Talent engine: EIR/FIR program, standing founder offers, operator bench you can drop into P&L roles within two weeks.

  

# Incentives that actually work

- Founders must be truly rich if it works (30--40% at start, meaningful ESOP on top). The studio's value is speed and de-risking--not taking 80% of the cap table.
- HoldCo carry on realized value creation inside each opco (measured vs. a capital-at-work baseline) keeps the central team focused on operating outcomes, not just new launches.
- Portfolio leadership LTIP tied to consolidated ROIC and cash conversion rather than vanity metrics.

  

# Minimal numbers to sanity-check the model (illustrative)

- Launch pace: 3 newcos/year; expect 1 quick kill, 1 moderate, 1 potential breakout.
- Capital: ~€7--10M/yr at steady state (newco seeds €1--1.5M each; follow-ons and bolt-ons take the rest).
- Target: By year 5, 6--8 active opcos; 2--3 throwing €2--4M/yr each in free cash flow up to HoldCo; recycle into the next wave.
- If one platform compounder emerges (ARR €25--40M, 20--25% FCF margins), the engine self-funds.

  

# What

# not

#  to do

- Don't chase a sovereign allocator model; you won't have cost-of-capital or scale advantages early.
- Don't become fee-first. Asset management economics can quietly pull you away from building real operating advantage.
- Don't be "sector-agnostic" at the start; the studio succeeds on repeatable distribution and customer access, not ideation.

  

# 12-month execution plan (practical)

1. Define the edge: pick 1--2 verticals with provable distribution advantages (e.g., industrial services + applied AI tooling; healthcare ops + workflow automation; supply chain data + fintech).

2. Stand up HoldCo: capital policy, investment memo template, governance, kill criteria, and 70/20/10 allocation rule.

3. Build the shared stack: recruiting pod, RevOps pod, CFO/Legal desk, data platform. Ship v1 playbooks.

4. Talent pipeline: secure 4--6 EIRs/FIRs and 10--15 operator-athletes (sales leads, PMs, controllers).

5. First wave: launch 2--3 newcos; pursue 1 bolt-on acquisition where you can lift margins via your stack.

6. Set up a small co-invest sidecar with friendly LPs for follow-ons (keeps you in control while augmenting firepower).

7. Milestone cadence: 90-day reviews; kill or double-down decisions based on pre-agreed metrics.

## Direct answers to your explicit questions

- "Do we build businesses to funnel money into investing and build a giant investment company?"

Build businesses to generate durable cash flow, which then funds more control-oriented building and selective acquisitions. You become a compounder with an internal venture engine, not a generic investment firm.

- "Do we maintain our built businesses long-term, never really divesting?"

Yes, default to long-term hold. Use partial liquidity selectively to recycle capital. Full exits only when your edge is gone or pricing is irrationally high.

- "How do we aim for control? The money or business angle?"

Business/control first in platform assets (majority voting, board control, vetoes). Use money/control-light stakes only where your operating leverage is low but financial upside is clear.

- "Is a venture factory the wrong angle?"

A pure factory is rarely capital-efficient. A Compounder Studio--evergreen HoldCo + focused studio + optional co-invest capital--is the right angle for building real-world value that compounds.
