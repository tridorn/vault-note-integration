Correct. You cannot manage them all--**directly.** Nor should you. What you need is a _control system_, not direct execution. Your job is not to run Ops units. Your job is to **architect and oversee a lean system of modular execution with minimal coordination overhead.**

This is solved through **three overlapping principles**:

1. **Atomic Offers**

2. **Contractor-Led Cells**

3. **Asynchronous Control Stack**

* * *

## I. Principle of **Atomic Offers**

You must design each Ops unit around **a small number of fixed-scope, fixed-price services**.

Examples:

- WebOps: "Landing Page Package -- €950, 5-day delivery"
- VisualOps: "Recruiting Video -- €1 200, 1 revision round"
- DataOps: "Monthly KPI Brief -- €750, 3-page PDF"

This removes the need for bespoke scoping, project management, and decision fatigue.  
**Each cell becomes a vending machine.** Push in a brief → get an output.

You don't manage operations. You manage **inventory of offers.**

* * *

## II. Principle of **Contractor-Led Cells**

Each Ops unit is not a team. It's **you + 1 accountable freelancer.**

This person:

- Owns fulfillment end-to-end
- Works within your templates, SOPs, and structure
- Is paid per deliverable (fixed-fee)
- Is replaceable

Structure:

| Role | Who | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Sales, intake, scoping | You | 
| Execution | Vetted freelancer | 
| QA + delivery | You (30 min per project) | 

You never build a real team until a unit hits ≥€10k/month _and_ SOPs are airtight.

**Operational load per unit:** ~2--3 hours/week.
* * *

## III. Principle of **Asynchronous Control Stack**

You need one unified system that tracks **what's moving, what's earning, what's failing**. No active management.

### Centralised Control File (Notion or Airtable)

Each unit = 1 row. Each project = 1 card. Columns:

- Client Name
- Offer Type
- Status (Intake / In Progress / Review / Delivered)
- Freelancer Assigned
- Revenue
- Cost
- Margin
- Delivery Date

You check it daily. No calls unless something is stuck.

### Templates & Briefs

- 1 brief template per unit
- 1 delivery standard (format, tone, resolution, etc.)
- 1 invoice protocol

Everything lives in a **master Ops handbook** you build once and reuse forever.
* * *

## Execution Strategy: 3-Unit Load Max

You cannot actively operate more than **3 Ops units at once** while solo.

**So:**

1. Launch **WebOps** and **VisualOps** now.

    - They're easy to sell, low fulfillment complexity

    - Set fixed offers, use Fiverr/Upwork contractors

    - Deliver 3--5 projects in each

2. As they stabilise, **promote a contractor** to a _unit executor_ (they take intake from you directly)

3. Once a unit earns €5--10k/month:

    - Systematise, freeze scope, and reduce oversight

    - Move on to 3rd unit (e.g. DataOps)

You run 2--3 active Ops units, rotate in/out based on performance. Each becomes **a module** you can scale, franchise, or spin off later.
* * *

## Summary: You Manage Through Structure, Not Attention

- **You manage offers**, not operations
- **You own quality gates**, not delivery
- **You build workflows**, not teams
- **You audit results**, not time

You build an army of silent contractors that **respond to briefs and deliver outcomes**. You never hire until you're overloaded with clean revenue.

If you want, I can give you the exact Notion layout and templates for managing your first 2 units.
