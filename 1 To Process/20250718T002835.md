Below is a **from-scratch vault scaffold that is _purely_ lifecycle-driven.**  
Every top-level folder is a stage in the life of a piece of information, and every sub-folder is an optional stop on its journey. Together they form a **MECE conveyor belt**: notes advance forward, never sideways, and at any moment you know _why_ a file is where it is.

## 0. Design logic (one minute read)

| Design choice | Rationale | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Numbered stages (`00_… 09_…`)** | Keeps Git diffs stable and folders naturally sort by flow order. | 
| **Eight lifecycle stages** | Enough granularity to pinpoint status without encouraging procrastination micro-moves. | 
| **Three depth max** | Avoids "Russian-doll" nesting; beyond level 3 you use links & tags, not more folders. | 
| **Stage verbs** | Folder names describe _what happens_ inside (Capture, Sort, Incubate …). | 
| **"Move, don't copy" rule** | A note exists in **one** stage at a time--clarity beats duplication. |

## 3. Practical tips for Git-synced peace of mind

1. **Initial commit:**
    
        git init && git add . && git commit -m "Lifecycle scaffold v1"
    

2. **Atomic moves:** move a note _once_ per session; Git history then mirrors real progress.

3. **Stage-prefix hooks:** optional pre-commit hook autogenerates commit messages like `Move: 05_Workbench ➜ 06_Deliver`.

4. **Quarterly pruning:** empty or unused sub-folders are collapsed--structure shrinks naturally over time.

### Ready to iterate

This scaffold is intentionally **larger than you need today** so nothing new forces a redesign tomorrow. Tell me which stages or sub-stages feel redundant or missing, and we'll pare it down--or expand--until it matches your exact mental workflow.
