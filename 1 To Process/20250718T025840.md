Precise rewrite of your query: "Determine whether to prioritise absolute handle uniformity or opportunistic capture of 'Dornhelm' where obtainable, outline the branding implications (surname-centric vs. full name), and specify a defensible capitalisation protocol across heterogeneous platforms."

* * *

### 1 Decision Frame

| Option | Friction | Discoverability | Future-Proofing | Perceived Credibility | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **A. Uniform handle (@TDornhelm everywhere)** | Nil--the same mnemonic across ecosystems | High--search yields one canonical entity | Strong--zero namespace drift if new services arise | Solid--consistent identity signals trust | 
| **B. Mixed handle (grab @Dornhelm when free; fallback to @TDornhelm elsewhere)** | Medium--users must remember two variants | Fragmented--search results bifurcate | Weak--each new platform re-opens the availability gamble | Variable--looks improvised on sites where only the fallback appears | 

Uniformity optimises user recall, SEO consolidation, and reduces operational overhead. The only reason to deviate is if the shorter masthead confers strategic prestige that outweighs the coordination cost. Presently it does not.

### 2 Brand Axis: Surname vs. Full Name

- **Surname-centric ("Dornhelm")**

    - **Pros** -- concise, martial, and transferable should you later reposition away from the "Tristan" persona (e.g., multi-author venture or product line).

    - **Cons** -- strips personal warmth; could read as corporate shell rather than individual thinker.
- **Full-name ("Tristan Dornhelm")**

    - **Pros** -- unambiguously personal; anchors thought-leadership to a single mind.

    - **Cons** -- longer, harder to watermark in small UI real estate.

Given you already own **Dornhelm.com**, deploy the domain as headquarters while operating the **@TDornhelm** handle everywhere. Within long-form content and by-lines, continue to sign as **Tristan Dornhelm** to keep the intellectual credit personal. This produces a concise public handle, a formidable domain, and a human author tag--all aligned.

### 3 Capitalisation Doctrine

- **Handles**: assume enforced lowercase. Any service honouring case will still resolve; typographic flourish is not worth the confusion. Default to lowercase in outbound marketing to pre-empt mis-typing.
- **Display Name / Bio Lines**: capitalise properly ("Tristan Dornhelm"), or, if leaning surname-first, "DORNHELM" as logo-type and "Tristan Dornhelm" in body copy. Maintain one style guide and replicate it.

### 4 Execution Checklist

1. **Audit** availability of **@TDornhelm** on every current and foreseeable platform (mainstream, developer-centric, emerging social).

2. **Register** @TDornhelm universally; refrain from mixed strategy unless at least 90 % of major platforms offer bare "@Dornhelm"--they won't.

3. **Redirect** any incidental @Dornhelm (wherever you manage to secure it) to the uniform identity through profile links or auto-responses; never present it as primary.

4. **Lock** domain e-mail (e.g., [contact@dornhelm.com](mailto:contact@dornhelm.com)) to reinforce surname positioning while handle remains initial-surname.

5. **Publish** a concise style guide for capitalisation and logo usage; enforce internally and with collaborators.

**Verdict**: commit to **uniformity**. Operate under **@tdornhelm** (lowercase), keep **Dornhelm.com** as the core asset, and sign content "Tristan Dornhelm." This alignment minimises cognitive load, maximises search coherence, and preserves optionality for future brand extensions.
