### **Architectural Concept**

**1. Exterior Design**  
	- **Gothic Revival Facade:** Drawing from the Victorian fascination with Gothic Revival, the estate features a richly detailed stone facade with pointed arch windows, intricate cornices, and an asymmetrical layout. The exterior combines limestone and red brickwork, with ivy-clad walls adding character and a sense of antiquity.  
	- **Central Clock Tower:** Inspired by Victorian industrial innovation, a grand clock tower serves as both a focal point and a functional feature. The clock’s design incorporates wrought iron detailing and stained-glass accents, visible from across the estate grounds.  
	- **Ornate Entryway and Grand Steps:** A sweeping stone staircase leads to an arched, double-door entrance framed by pillars and wrought-iron lanterns, creating an inviting yet stately entry.

**2. Interior Layout**  
	- **Great Hall with Grand Staircase:** Upon entry, guests are greeted by a grand staircase with intricately carved banisters and a gallery-style landing. Above, a stained-glass skylight floods the space with natural light.  
	- **Drawing Room and Music Salon:** These twin rooms, adorned with velvet drapes, damask wallpaper, and marble fireplaces, serve as both private family spaces and venues for hosting gatherings. The music salon, complete with a grand piano, has acoustics tailored for intimate performances.  
	- **Library and Study:** Featuring dark mahogany shelves, a rolling ladder, and high-backed leather armchairs, the library serves as a quiet sanctuary for study and reading. Adjoining it, a private study for the estate owner is furnished with an antique desk, brass lamps, and Victorian-era maps and memorabilia.  
	- **Ballroom:** A larger room inspired by Victorian ballrooms, with a polished wooden floor, grand mirrors, and crystal chandeliers. Gilded accents on the walls and ceiling frescoes add a touch of Edwardian opulence, perfect for private events or family celebrations.

### **Special Features**

**1. The Winter Garden and Conservatory**

	- Furnished with wicker and brass, the conservatory captures Victorian enthusiasm for botany and offers a sunny escape during colder months.

**2. Tower Rooms with Observatory**

**3. Gentlemen’s and Ladies’ Lounges**  
	- Inspired by Victorian social customs, the estate includes separate lounges. The gentlemen’s lounge features dark wood paneling, leather armchairs, and a cigar humidor, evoking a sense of the Victorian clubroom.  
	- The ladies’ lounge is decorated with floral wallpaper, pastel colors, and art nouveau accents, serving as a refined and intimate gathering space for tea or conversation.

**4. Private Chapel and Reflection Room**  
	- A small, Gothic-style chapel designed for family reflection or small gatherings. Stained-glass windows depict symbolic scenes or family emblems, creating a reverent atmosphere.  
	- Adjacent to the chapel, a quiet reflection room with cushioned benches and a small library of philosophical texts offers a sanctuary for contemplation and wellness practices.
