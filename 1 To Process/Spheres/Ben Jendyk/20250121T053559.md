### **Architectural Concept**

**1. Exterior Design**  
	- **Cotswold Stone Manor:** Constructed from the iconic, locally sourced honey-colored limestone, this manor exudes a warm and inviting appearance. Its architecture would be classic, with tall chimneys, pitched slate roofs, and ivy-draped walls.  
	- **Symmetrical Facade with Central Entrance:** The manor’s design is stately and balanced, with a grand, arched entrance framed by large, Georgian-style windows. Traditional elements like window shutters and wrought-iron detailing add depth and elegance.  
	- **Timeless Roof Design with Chimneys:** Multiple chimneys, reminiscent of Tudor and Georgian architecture, give a classic profile, while dormer windows add charm to the attic or upper-floor spaces.

**2. Interior Layout**  
	- **Drawing Room and Formal Sitting Room:** The drawing room, a central social space, is designed with high ceilings, wainscoting, and elegant chandeliers. Filled with traditional furnishings, it’s ideal for afternoon tea, gatherings, or quiet reading by the fire.  
	- **Orangery and Sunlit Conservatory:** An adjoining glass-walled orangery with antique tile flooring allows sunlight to stream in year-round. Filled with flowering plants and light wicker furniture, it’s a perfect morning room.  
	- **Private Family Quarters and Guest Suites:** Elegant suites feature plush furnishings, fireplaces, and scenic views. Each room is decorated in traditional English decor—soft fabrics, floral prints, and four-poster beds—adding warmth and character.  
	- **Dining Hall and Wine Cellar:** The dining hall, with a long wooden table and candelabras, evokes grandeur and tradition, while the stone wine cellar below stores an extensive collection, including local and European wines.

	- **Secret Garden or Maze:** A hidden garden with climbing roses, wisteria, and a small wrought-iron gate that leads into a secluded area. Alternatively, a small hedge maze would add whimsy and intrigue to the grounds.

**3. Traditional Conservatory and Herb Garden**  
	- **Victorian-Style Conservatory:** This glass-walled conservatory serves as a greenhouse and leisure area, filled with plants like orchids, citrus trees, and ferns. In colder months, it becomes a warm, sunlit refuge.
