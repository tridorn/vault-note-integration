**Restated**: _"Expand the design of the family estate--rationally, not romantically. Focus on physical layout, sensory composition, and environmental placement. I want to clearly visualise the experience of being there."_

* * *

## 1. Geographical Environment: **Alpine Forested Hillside, Mid-Elevation (~900--1,200m)**

| Feature | Specification | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Orientation** | Southeast-facing slope for morning light, mountain shield to northwest for wind protection | 
| **Perimeter** | Forest edge on three sides, open valley on fourth--overlook, not exposure | 
| **Plot size** | 8,000--12,000 sqm (core compound ~1,200 sqm footprint) | 
| **Access** | Private gravel path (~800m) from local road; gate invisible from entrance | 
| **View** | Not panoramic. Filtered through trees. Controlled. Designed for psychological containment, not spectacle | 

**Noise**: Absent. Wind in trees, stream nearby. Possibly cowbells from a distant pasture.  
**Air**: Cold at night, dry and fresh. Earth and stone scent dominate. No car exhaust, ever.  
**Sky**: Always visible but partially occluded by the inner garden walls or eaves.

## 2. Compound Layout: **Walled U-Shape Around Inner Garden**

### Zones by Function

| Zone | Description | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **The Front Gate** | Stone arch, no ornament, oak door with iron hardware. Opens into cloistered transition corridor. No direct entry into main courtyard. | 
| **Cloister Walk** | Covered stone passage along inner side of U-shape; each section connects to a function-specific zone. Cloister is always silent. No loud conversation permitted. | 
| **Inner Garden** | Enclosed. Medicinal herbs, gravel paths, controlled lawn. A single bench. Used for contemplation, not socialising. No furniture. Central tree (maple or linden). | 
| **The Library** | Heavy door, no windows. Vaulted ceiling. Bookcases embedded in walls. One central table with two chairs. Climate-controlled. Silence required. Fire permitted. | 
| **Map Room** | Adjacent to Library. Flat room. Walls clad in wood. Three levels of maps: 1. world strategic, 2. historical lineage (e.g. past travels, properties), 3. Eupator system maps. | 
| **Chapel Room** | Circular or hexagonal. Window slit faces sunrise. One stone altar. Floor polished stone. No ornament. Always unlocked. No seating. Never used casually. | 
| **Family Wing** | Private loggia with valley-facing views. Each room austere but high-comfort: stone + linen. Thick doors. No electronics visible. Walls: silent. | 
| **Kitchen + Hearth** | Stone oven, copper fixtures, thick counter slabs. Cooking is analog. Open fireplace but industrial ventilation. No "entertaining" concept--only nourishment. | 
| **Lower Vault** | Hidden entry. Climate- and humidity-controlled room with safes, codex storage, sealed boxes, and items that never leave. No Wi-Fi, no external cables. One internal workstation air-gapped. |

## 3. Material & Textural Design

| Element | Specification | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Walls (Exterior)** | Local stone, dry-laid where possible. Thick. Age-enhancing. | 
| **Floors (Interior)** | Ground floor: honed limestone. Upper floors: dark oak. Basements: polished stone. No synthetics. | 
| **Furniture** | Fixed or built-in. No clutter. Every item has purpose, many dual-use (bench = chest). | 
| **Lighting** | Soft, indirect, embedded in ceiling troughs or behind beams. No ceiling downlights. Primary ambient source: daylight. | 
| **Heating** | Underfloor + fireplaces. Supplementary concealed radiators. No forced air. | 
| **Technology** | Invisible. No visible monitors. Wi-Fi silent zones. One central server room under physical lock. | 
* * *

## 4. Psychological Geography

**Movement Design**:

- Entry is ritualised. From car to walking path to gate to cloister to garden.
- Every room accessed by walking along defined stone or timber path. No random cutting through.
- Rooms are psychologically distinct. Entering the Library or Chapel produces an internal shift.

**Ritual Coding**:

- Morning walk in garden: mandatory on first day back.
- First day after long absence: 1 hour in the Chapel alone.
- No eating in non-designated areas (not even tea).
- Map Room opened only during strategic reset periods (e.g. new decade, new venture, major loss).

## 5. Weather + Seasonal Adaptation

| Season | Atmosphere | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Winter** | Interior feels tighter. Fireplaces used daily. Snow piles in courtyard. Sounds absorbed. Time slows. | 
| **Spring** | Inner garden reactivates. First medicinal herbs emerge. Light enters lower windows again. | 
| **Summer** | Cool interior air due to stone mass. Courtyard used in morning only. Forest canopy at its peak. | 
| **Autumn** | Ritual season. Best for codex writing. Tree in garden turns. Fireplace + thick wool blankets. | 
* * *

## 6. Security and Sovereignty

- **Fence-line**: 3m stone wall on forest-facing sides. Metal gate--manual.
- **Sensors**: Motion + IR perimeter, not network-connected. Logged, not streamed.
- **Guests**: Pre-cleared. One guesthouse 100m from core compound. Never sleeps inside main house unless designated by rite.
- **Backup**: Generator room + battery wall. Solar panel array on east-facing roof.
- **Archives**: Three-layer lock: physical, passphrase, biometric. Logged access only. One emergency destroy mechanism (manual).

## 7. Final Concept Summary

| Parameter | Output | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Location** | Forested hillside near Lake Ã„geri or Alpthal (Schwyz/Obwalden) | 
| **Function** | Permanent anchor of self and dynasty | 
| **Size** | ~1,200 sqm enclosed build on ~10,000 sqm plot | 
| **Aesthetic** | Neo-Romanesque brutalism: stone, wood, darkness, permanence | 
| **Atmosphere** | Quiet, tight, inward. Power is implied, not shown. | 
| **Purpose** | Sovereignty, not comfort. Memory, not lifestyle. You do not live here. You _return_ here. |
