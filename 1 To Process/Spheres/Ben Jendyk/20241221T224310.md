The **Dynamic Pressure System** is designed to challenge you continuously by increasing your **Hourly Income Requirement (HIR)** based on performance, creating urgency to find and expand income streams. Here's an **enhanced and more ambitious version** of the system:

---

### **Dynamic Pressure System: Enhanced**

This system dynamically adjusts your HIR based on performance—both positive and negative—to ensure constant growth and accountability. It is ambitious, forcing you to push your limits while balancing the risk of failure.

---

### **Core Principles**

1. **Base HIR Increase**:
	- Your **HIR automatically increases every month**, regardless of performance.
	- Starting point: €1/hour (16 hours/day = €16/day).
	- Monthly increase: **€0.20/hour**.
	- Example:
	  - Month 1: €1.00/hour (€16/day).
	  - Month 2: €1.20/hour (€19.20/day).
	  - Month 3: €1.40/hour (€22.40/day).

2. **Performance-Based Adjustments**:
	- Your HIR adjusts dynamically based on how well you meet your **daily or monthly income targets**.
	- Two performance triggers:
	  - **Missed Goals Penalty**: Failing to meet targets increases the HIR.
	  - **Exceeded Goals Reward**: Exceeding targets increases the HIR even more aggressively.

3. **Progression Pressure**:
	- Every time you fail to adapt to the new HIR for two consecutive months, the monthly increase doubles (e.g., from €0.20/hour to €0.40/hour).

---

### **Dynamic Adjustments**

#### **Missed Goals Penalty**

	- If you miss your daily HIR goal **5 or more days in a month**, your HIR increases by **an additional €0.10/hour** for the next month.
	- If you miss it **10 or more days**, increase by **€0.20/hour**.

#### **Exceeded Goals Reward**

	- If you exceed your daily HIR goal for **10 or more days in a month**, increase your HIR by an **additional €0.15/hour** for the next month.
	- If you exceed your goal for the entire month (every single day), increase by **€0.30/hour**.

---

### **Key Components of the System**

1. **Ambitious Base Increases**:
	- HIR increases by €0.20/hour monthly by default, regardless of performance.
	- This ensures you're constantly under pressure to earn more.

2. **Cascading Pressure**:
	- If you fail to meet your monthly income target **for 2 consecutive months**, the **base monthly increase doubles** to €0.40/hour until you catch up.

3. **Success Multiplier**:
	- Exceeding targets accelerates your growth. The more consistently you outperform, the faster your HIR grows, forcing you to scale your income streams.

4. **Weekly Checkpoints**:
	- Break the month into weekly goals to maintain accountability.
	- Example:
	  - Weekly goal at €1/hour: €112 (16 hours × €7/day × 7 days).
	  - Weekly goal at €1.20/hour: €134.40.

5. **Daily Surplus Pressure**:
	- If you earn more than your daily HIR target, the **excess is automatically added to your next day’s target**.
	- Example:
	  - Earn €20 when the target is €16 → Add €4 to tomorrow’s target.

### **Ambitious Example Timeline**

#### **Month 1** (Starting)

- HIR: €1.00/hour (€16/day).
- Monthly Target: €480.

#### **Month 2** (Base Increase)

- HIR: €1.20/hour (€19.20/day).
- Monthly Target: €576.
- Missed Goals 7 Days → Penalty: €0.10/hour.
- New HIR for Month 3: €1.30/hour.

#### **Month 3** (Cascading Increase)

- HIR: €1.30/hour (€20.80/day).
- Monthly Target: €624.
- Exceeded Goals for 15 Days → Reward: €0.15/hour.
- New HIR for Month 4: €1.45/hour.

#### **Month 4** (Ambition Rising)

- HIR: €1.45/hour (€23.20/day).
- Monthly Target: €696.
- Missed Goals 10 Days → Penalty: €0.20/hour.
- New HIR for Month 5: €1.65/hour.

### **Additional Rules for High Ambition**

1. **Rapid-Failure Recovery**:
	- If you miss your monthly target by **more than 20%**, you must:
	  - Dedicate 2 extra hours/day to earning for the next month.
	  - Increase HIR by an **additional €0.10/hour** immediately.

2. **Income Diversification Incentive**:
	- Bonus increases for generating income from **new streams**:
	  - First new stream: +€0.05/hour.
	  - Second new stream: +€0.10/hour.

3. **Minimum Monthly Growth Requirement**:
	- If your monthly income doesn’t grow by at least **10%**, apply a penalty of **€0.15/hour**.

### **Example Of Ambitious HIR Progression Over 6 Months**

| **Month** | **Base HIR (€)** | **Daily Target (€)** | **Performance Adjustment (€)** | **New HIR (€)** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1         | 1.00             | 16.00               | Base                           | 1.00            |
| 2         | 1.20             | 19.20               | Penalty for missed goals       | 1.30            |
| 3         | 1.30             | 20.80               | Reward for exceeding targets   | 1.45            |
| 4         | 1.45             | 23.20               | Penalty for missed goals       | 1.65            |
| 5         | 1.65             | 26.40               | Cascading pressure (failure)   | 1.85            |
| 6         | 1.85             | 29.60               | Bonus for new income streams   | 2.00            |

### **Tracking And Implementation Tips**

1. **Set Up Automation**:
	- Use a financial app or spreadsheet to calculate daily targets and track performance.
	- Automate base HIR increases and penalties/rewards.

2. **Visual Progress**:
	- Create a graph showing your HIR growth over time.
	- Include milestones for monthly income, investment contributions, and new income streams.

3. **Investment Alignment**:
	- As your HIR grows, increase the portion of your income directed to investments.
	- Example: Start with 50% of earnings → Gradually increase to 70%.

This ambitious system will push you to constantly seek new opportunities, adapt quickly to failures, and grow sustainably. Would you like a spreadsheet template or tool recommendations to manage this?
