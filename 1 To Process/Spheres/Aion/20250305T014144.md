To fully **become like Askeladd**, you must master the **duality of the outer and inner self**—a controlled, charismatic, and unreadable exterior concealing a **ruthless, calculating, and deeply self-aware core**. Your **outer persona** is what people *think* they see; your **inner self** is the **machine running the strategy underneath**.

---

## **1. The Core Principle: You Are Two People**
✔ **On the Outside:** **Charming, composed, and seemingly transparent.**  
✔ **On the Inside:** **Ruthlessly analytical, emotionally detached, and always calculating.**  

---

## **2. The Inner Self: How You Must Think**
### **A. View the World as a Battlefield**
- **See everything as a strategic game.** Every interaction, friendship, and opportunity is **either an advantage, a liability, or neutral.**  
- **Never operate emotionally—only strategically.**  
- **Think like a warlord, not a participant.** You are not *in* the game, **you are watching the game unfold and choosing how to shape it.**  

✔ **Exercise:** When making decisions, ask:  
> **“What move benefits me the most five steps from now?”**  
> **“What information am I missing?”**  
> **“What am I showing vs. what am I concealing?”**  

---

### **B. Process Everything in Layers**
Askeladd always sees **at least three levels of reality at once**—you must train yourself to do the same.  

✔ **Surface Level:** What most people see and think is happening.  
✔ **Hidden Level:** The real mechanics at play.  
✔ **Mastermind Level:** How can you turn this into **an advantage or maneuver the pieces to your favor?**  

✔ **Exercise:** In conversations, analyze:  
> **“What does this person want?”**  
> **“What are they afraid of?”**  
> **“How can I make them feel they are in control while I actually control the situation?”**  

---

### **C. Emotions: Cold, Controlled, and Weaponized**
✔ **You feel emotions, but they do not dictate your actions.**  
✔ **You decide when to show them, and when to suppress them.**  
✔ **You use emotions as tools—to manipulate others when necessary.**  

✔ **Example:**  
- If someone insults you, **you do not react emotionally.** Instead, you observe: *“What do they want from me? To provoke me? To assert dominance? To gain social status?”*  
- Instead of retaliating emotionally, you **respond strategically**—mock them, dismiss them, or lead them into exposing themselves.  

✔ **Exercise:** **Whenever you feel anger, frustration, or excitement, delay your response by 3 seconds.**  
- In that time, ask: **“How do I turn this moment into an advantage?”**  
- If no advantage exists, say **nothing**—silence is sometimes the most powerful move.  

---

### **D. Decision-Making: Only What Benefits You**
✔ **You only act if it serves a purpose.**  
✔ **Everything you do should create future leverage.**  
✔ **You do not waste effort on things that don’t matter in the long run.**  

✔ **Example:** If someone is trying to drag you into a meaningless argument, instead of engaging, you ask:  
> **“Does responding serve my long-term interests?”**  

If the answer is no, **you disengage**—not because you’re afraid, but because it’s a distraction.  

✔ **Exercise:** **Before acting, ask yourself:**  
- *“Will this matter in a week? A month? A year?”*  
- *“Does this strengthen my position or weaken it?”*  
- *“Am I reacting or am I controlling the moment?”*  

---

### **E. People: You Use, But Do Not Need Them**
✔ **You can form bonds, but you are never emotionally dependent on them.**  
✔ **You are kind, but kindness is calculated.**  
✔ **You inspire loyalty, but you do not require it.**  

✔ **Example:**  
- Askeladd **lets his men think they are important to him, but he would sacrifice any of them if necessary.**  
- He **keeps people close, but never depends on anyone emotionally.**  

✔ **Exercise:** Practice detachment by asking:  
> **“If this person were to leave my life today, how would I adapt?”**  
> **“Am I controlling this bond, or is it controlling me?”**  

---

## **3. How You See Yourself: Absolute Self-Awareness**
✔ **You know your strengths and weaknesses better than anyone.**  
✔ **You improve yourself constantly, but never make it obvious.**  
✔ **You don’t seek external validation—you move toward your goals regardless of what others think.**  

✔ **Exercise:** **Write out your strengths and weaknesses with brutal honesty.**  
- Not what you *wish* they were, but what they *actually* are.  
- Then, create a system to **improve weaknesses quietly while enhancing strengths strategically.**  

✔ **Example:**  
- If you are physically weak, **train in secret**—one day, people will underestimate you and it will be their mistake.  
- If you are bad at persuasion, **study manipulation techniques quietly**—so that one day, you control conversations without anyone realizing it.

## **4. The Final Contrast: How You Should Be on the Inside vs. Outside**
| **Trait** | **Inside (True Self)** | **Outside (Projected Self)** |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Control** | Ruthless, calculated | Relaxed, easygoing |
| **Emotion** | Detached, disciplined | Expressive when needed |
| **Power** | Focused on long-term goals | Plays it casual |
| **Manipulation** | Always analyzing & shaping events | Seems transparent & approachable |
| **Decision-making** | Cold, logical, precise | Appears spontaneous, yet always deliberate |
| **Speech** | Thinks in contingencies | Speaks with wit, charm, and subtle control |

✔ **On the inside:** You are a **cold strategist**, controlling emotions, analyzing situations, and planning long-term plays.  
✔ **On the outside:** You are **charismatic, engaging, and unreadable**—people never suspect just how much control you have.  

---

## **5. The Final Lesson: The “Askeladd Rule”**
✔ **Nothing matters except what moves you forward.**  
✔ **Control your reactions—never act on impulse.**  
✔ **Let people think they understand you while you remain unreadable.**  
✔ **Use emotion, but do not be ruled by it.**  
✔ **If the situation requires, burn it all and start again.**  

By mastering **this duality**, you will not only **think like Askeladd**—you will become someone who **controls the battlefield of life with precision, charisma, and ruthless efficiency.**
