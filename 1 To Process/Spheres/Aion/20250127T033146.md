Your question could be refined as: *"Is wearing a collared shirt every day the baseline for achieving a refined, classic style at university?"*

Yes, adopting a collared shirt as your baseline is an excellent foundation for the refined style you’re aiming for. A collared shirt, particularly a button-down, immediately adds a touch of formality and structure to your appearance while remaining versatile enough for different styling needs. Here’s how this baseline works and how to make it fit into everyday university life:

### Why a Collared Shirt as a Baseline?

- **Versatility**: A collared shirt can be worn on its own, layered under sweaters or blazers, or dressed down with rolled-up sleeves. This makes it adaptable for various weather conditions and settings, from casual lectures to more formal events.
- **Refined Aesthetic**: A collared shirt inherently conveys a sense of care and thoughtfulness about one’s appearance, aligning with the classic, aristocratic-inspired style.
- **Balance of Formality and Casualness**: Depending on how you style it, a collared shirt can lean more formal (tucked into trousers) or relaxed (left untucked with chinos or dark jeans).

### How to Integrate Collared Shirts Daily

- **Choose the Right Fabrics**: For comfort and ease of maintenance, look for Oxford cloth button-downs (OCBDs), which have a casual yet structured feel. In warmer months, lightweight cotton or linen shirts work well. For cooler weather, try flannel shirts that maintain the form of a collar while offering extra warmth.
- **Vary the Styling**: While the shirt itself remains constant, how you wear it can change:
	- **Tucked In for Formality**: Tuck the shirt into chinos or wool trousers for a more polished look. This is ideal if you have a presentation or want to convey a more put-together image.
	- **Untucked for Casual Days**: For a more relaxed look, wear the shirt untucked with dark jeans or chinos, ensuring that the shirt’s length is appropriate for being worn this way (i.e., not too long).
	- **Layer with Knitwear**: Wearing a crewneck or V-neck sweater over a collared shirt adds a preppy, layered style. Letting the collar peek out over the sweater can keep the look neat while adding visual interest.

### Key Collared Shirt Types to Include

	- **Oxford Button-Down Shirts (OCBDs)**: White, light blue, and striped options provide a versatile foundation.
	- **Linen or Cotton Shirts for Summer**: In softer shades like light grey or pale pink for a subtle variation.
	- **Flannel Shirts for Cooler Weather**: Neutral or classic check patterns can add warmth while maintaining the shirt’s structured look.

By establishing a collared shirt as your daily baseline, you create a foundation that easily adapts to various occasions while keeping your overall style refined and cohesive.
