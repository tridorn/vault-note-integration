You bring up excellent points! Let’s reassess the logical flow and the placement of **"The Moment is Mine"**, **"Unyielding Will,"** and **"Silent Authority"** for better coherence and practical application.

---

### **Revisiting "The Moment is Mine"**

Placing it at the **end** makes sense if the goal is to reinforce presence and intention after completing the sequence of mantras. This way, it acts as a culmination of all the ideas, bringing the focus back to the present and ensuring intentionality moving forward. 

---

### **Addressing "Unyielding Will" And "Silent Authority"**

Both mantras focus on resilience and leadership, but their placement depends on how we interpret their roles:

1. **Unyielding Will**:
	- This mantra emphasizes **inner strength** and the ability to overcome obstacles.  
	- It could fit better earlier in the sequence, as **resilience is foundational** for maintaining progress in the face of challenges.  
	- It could follow "Discipline is Freedom" and precede "Vision First," ensuring that you are mentally fortified before focusing on your long-term goals.

2. **Silent Authority**:
	- This mantra emphasizes **leading through quiet strength** and feels like a more **advanced stage of leadership** that comes after mastering internal discipline, purposeful action, and value creation.  
	- It makes sense to place this **toward the end**, as leadership is a natural culmination of earlier mantras like "Value Multiplier" and "Give and Grow."

### **Revised Logical Flow**

Here’s the updated sequence with considerations for better mental connections:

---

### **1. Calm Command**

*"I am calm and in control."*  
- Start by calming your mind and centering yourself. This establishes mental clarity and control.

---

### **2. Discipline is Freedom**

*"I master myself."*  
- Build on calmness by taking control of your thoughts, actions, and emotions. Self-mastery is essential for everything that follows.

---

### **3. Unyielding Will**

*"Nothing can stop me."*  
- Reinforce resilience and determination to fortify your mindset before setting your long-term vision. This ensures that no obstacle will derail your focus.

---

### **4. Vision First**

*"I see the bigger picture."*  
- With inner strength established, look outward and focus on your long-term vision. This gives you direction and purpose.

---

### **5. Strategic Precision**

*"I act with purpose."*  
- Translate your vision into deliberate and effective actions. This avoids wasted effort and keeps you aligned with your goals.

---

### **6. Value Multiplier**

*"I create immense value."*  
- Focus on creating value for others, as this is the foundation of sustainable success.

---

### **7. Give and Grow**

*"I lift others to rise higher."*  
- Extend value creation by helping others grow. Collaboration and mutual empowerment amplify your impact.

---

### **8. Infinite Opportunity**

*"I see abundance everywhere."*  
- Train yourself to recognize opportunities in every situation, reinforcing an optimistic and expansive mindset.

---

### **9. Endless Curiosity**

*"I learn endlessly."*  
- Build on the abundance mindset by staying curious and open to growth. Continuous learning ensures adaptability and innovation.

---

### **10. Silent Authority**

*"I lead through quiet strength."*  
- Once you've mastered yourself, created value, and empowered others, you can lead with calm confidence and competence. This represents maturity and mastery in leadership.

---

### **11. Time’s Steward**

*"I invest time wisely."*  
- As a leader, ensure that every moment is spent intentionally and aligned with your vision and priorities. Time management is essential for sustained success.

---

### **12. The Moment is Mine**

*"I own this moment."*  
- End with this mantra to ground yourself after completing the sequence. It brings you back to the present, allowing you to carry forward everything you’ve reinforced with full focus and ownership.

---

### **Why This Order Works**

1. **Foundation First**: Calmness, discipline, and resilience prepare your mind for long-term focus.
2. **Vision and Action**: Once grounded, you can focus on purposeful actions that create value and build relationships.
3. **Mindset Expansion**: Abundance and curiosity keep you open to opportunities and growth.
4. **Leadership and Optimization**: Leadership and time management come after mastering internal and external aspects.
5. **Re-grounding**: Ending with "The Moment is Mine" ensures intentionality and presence moving forward.

---

### **Practical Application**

- Repeat the short titles frequently as quick reminders.
- Use the full mantras as deeper reflections for specific situations.
- Begin and end your day with **"The Moment is Mine"**, using it to set and reset intentions.

This revised flow minimizes logical jumps and creates a natural progression from self-mastery to leadership and intentional living.
