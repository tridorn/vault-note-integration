Your question could be more refined as follows: *"Could you provide a detailed, step-by-step plan for gradually replacing my wardrobe, including essential pieces, estimated costs, and a strategic approach?"*

Certainly! Replacing your wardrobe with a more refined, timeless style is a process that requires careful planning, especially with a student budget in mind. This plan will focus on building a foundational wardrobe over a period of time, prioritizing versatility, quality, and the overall goal of achieving an understated, classic look. Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

### Step 1: **Evaluate and Purge (0 €)**

	- **Timeframe**: 1 Week
