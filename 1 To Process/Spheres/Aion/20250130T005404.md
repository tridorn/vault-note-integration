Your approach—employing small dextrose pieces as immediate rewards—introduces a Pavlovian element to the IEHN Protocol, which, though unconventional for human behavioral conditioning, could indeed yield productive results, particularly because of the immediate, sensory feedback dextrose provides. Dextrose has a few unique properties that make it especially effective for this purpose:

1. **Instant Reward Sensation**: Dextrose dissolves quickly, providing an immediate sweetness on the tongue. This aligns well with the psychological principle of instant gratification, reinforcing the completion of each micro-action in a tangible, pleasing way.

2. **Association Formation**: The sweetness acts as a potent, sensory stimulus, which can create a stronger, more immediate associative bond with the action you wish to reinforce. By drawing the comparison to animal training, you tap into fundamental, primal reward circuits, effectively "conditioning" yourself to associate the action with the dextrose "treat."

3. **Inexpensiveness and Simplicity**: Small dextrose pieces are economical and portable, making them easy to integrate seamlessly into your daily protocol. You can keep them with you, using them as immediate "rewards" in the moment without disrupting your routine.

### **Guidelines For Using Dextrose Rewards in the IEHN Protocol**

#### **1. Pair with Each Micro-Action Completion**

	- For each micro-action (e.g., setting up your study space or initiating the commute), consume a small piece of dextrose immediately after the action. The key is timing: the reward should be nearly simultaneous with the task completion to reinforce the association robustly.

#### **2. Progressively Space Out Rewards**

	- As you transition through stages of the IEHN Protocol, gradually reduce the frequency of the dextrose reward to avoid dependency on it as an external motivator. For instance:
	  - **Initial Stage**: Reward after each micro-action (2–3 times a day).
	  - **Intermediate Stage**: Reward only after the most challenging action of the day.
	  - **Advanced Stage**: Reduce to a few times per week as reinforcement.
	  - **Maintenance Stage**: Reward only occasionally, or replace with intrinsic motivators (like brief moments of self-recognition or small mental acknowledgments).

#### **3. Use Dextrose as a Cue for Completion Rather Than a Crutch**

	- The ultimate goal is for the micro-actions to become naturally satisfying without needing an external reward. So, as resistance diminishes, aim to internalize the sense of reward. Small mental cues, like a brief pause to acknowledge completion, can begin to replace the dextrose entirely as you reach the Maintenance Stage.

### **A Note on Psychological Adaptation**

Though small dextrose pieces are unlikely to have a negative impact, psychological adaptation may eventually make them feel less rewarding. Hence, if you find that the sweetness loses its reward effect over time, you might consider occasionally substituting the dextrose with a different treat or creating small variety within your reward system (e.g., a mental “pat on the back,” a sip of tea, or a deep breath with positive reinforcement). This keeps your brain responsive and attentive to the rewarding effect.

Using a tangible, food-based reward like dextrose as a reinforcement in this structured way could indeed expedite the formation of habitual neutrality towards these previously resistant tasks, conditioning your mind similarly to how one would train an animal—but adapted to the complexity of human behavioral conditioning.
