To **rebuild your Stoic framework** through the lens of **Askeladd’s philosophy**, we must strip away the **idealized, noble forms** you previously used and replace them with **figures forged in hardship, deception, and survival**. The virtues remain, but their interpretations change—**no longer pure, but tempered by reality**. These figures must not just embody the virtues in theory but **demonstrate how they are applied in a world where ideals alone are not enough.**  

Here is **your new pantheon**—the **backbone of your existence**, shaped not by heroism, but by **ruthless wisdom, pragmatic courage, restrained indulgence, and justice tempered by necessity.**  

---

### **1. WISDOM (Pragmatic, Manipulative, Ruthless) → OCTAVIUS, THE SCHEMER-KING**  
*“A man must know when to be a lion and when to be a fox. But the greatest men are both at once.”*  

Your old **noble ruler** (Lysander) was wise in the **idealistic sense**, but Askeladd would scoff at such naivety. True wisdom is **not the pursuit of virtue for its own sake**—it is the ability to see **the world as it is, not as it should be**, and to bend it to your will.  

✔ **Who is Octavius?**  
- A **man who rules, but never from the throne**.  
- A leader not by title, but by sheer **intelligence and manipulation**.  
- A kingmaker, not a king—a **shadow ruler** who governs through others, never exposing himself to unnecessary risk.  
- He knows the **power of deception**, using it not out of malice but because **truth alone is insufficient to win the game of life**.  

✔ **How does Octavius shape you?**  
- You **never reveal your true thoughts**—you show only what is useful.  
- You use **wisdom as a weapon**, not as an abstract virtue.  
- You think **five moves ahead, always ensuring that if you fall, you land on your feet.**  

✔ **Symbolism:**  
- **A silver coin** – Not because of greed, but because money is power and influence, and a man who understands it rules the world without ever lifting a sword.  
- **A mask** – Because sometimes, wisdom is in knowing when to conceal rather than reveal.  

> *Octavius does not seek wisdom for its own sake. He seeks wisdom because it is the only thing that ensures control over one's fate.*  

---

### **2. COURAGE (Brutal, Efficient, Unsentimental) → RHORDRI, THE WOLF IN CHAINS**  
*"You are not brave because you do not fear death. You are brave because you fight knowing death is inevitable."*  

Your old **Kaelan** was a **fierce warrior**, but courage is not **reckless aggression**—it is **controlled violence, applied with precision and purpose**. True courage is knowing **when to fight, when to retreat, and when to destroy everything to rebuild from nothing.**  

✔ **Who is Rhordri?**  
- A **warrior, but not a brute**—he does not fight for honor, he fights for survival and victory.  
- **A wolf who walks among men, wearing the chains of restraint**—but the moment they loosen, he strikes.  
- He does not waste words, does not seek glory, does not fight battles that do not serve a greater purpose.  

✔ **How does Rhordri shape you?**  
- You **do not act out of emotion**—you **fight when it is necessary, never before.**  
- You **do not seek honor, only victory**—if walking away is the smartest move, you walk away.  
- You never waste **energy on meaningless displays of strength**—if violence comes, you finish it quickly.  

✔ **Symbolism:**  
- **A broken chain** – Because true warriors are only dangerous when they are no longer restrained.  
- **A scarred wolf** – Because survival, not glory, is the measure of a warrior.  

> *Rhordri is not a berserker—he is the controlled, precise killer who never fights unless it serves his purpose. But when he does fight, it is final.*  

---

### **3. TEMPERANCE (Restraint, Calculation, Control) → VEDICA, THE POISONER WHO NEVER DRINKS**  
*"Indulgence is not evil, but it is a chain. And I refuse to be chained."*  

Your old **Ewan** was **a moderate farmer**, but Askeladd would tell you that **moderation is not passive—it is an active battle against the excesses that weaken men.** True temperance is **not simply avoiding indulgence, but controlling it—using it against others while never succumbing yourself.**  

✔ **Who is Vedica?**  
- A woman who knows the power of **poison—but never drinks it herself**.  
- A seductress who **manipulates the indulgences of others while remaining untouched by them**.  
- She sees **pleasure, food, wealth, and status as tools, not goals.**  

✔ **How does Vedica shape you?**  
- You **do not seek pleasure—you let pleasure seek you, and decide when (or if) you partake.**  
- You **observe what people indulge in, and use it to control them**.  
- You **do not drink the poison of excess—you serve it to others.**  

✔ **Symbolism:**  
- **A goblet filled with wine—but untouched.**  
- **A pair of dice—but never thrown.**  

> *Vedica is the ultimate master of self-control—because to truly control oneself is to have power over all who lack that same discipline.*  

---

### **4. JUSTICE (Calculated, Merciless, Long-Term) → SOLON, THE JUDGE WHO NEVER FORGETS**  
*"Justice is not about fairness. It is about consequences."*  

Your old **Maia** was a **loving mother**, embodying justice as kindness—but Askeladd knew that **true justice is cold, merciless, and sometimes requires destruction.** True justice **is not about being "good"—it is about ensuring that every action has its rightful outcome, no matter how painful.**  

✔ **Who is Solon?**  
- A man who **carries the memory of every crime, every debt, every betrayal.**  
- He does not forgive, but **he does not punish impulsively—he waits until the punishment serves its greatest purpose.**  
- He is **not a warm, loving figure—he is the executor of justice, whether cruel or kind.**  

✔ **How does Solon shape you?**  
- You **do not react immediately to wrongs—you remember, you calculate, and you act when it is most effective.**  
- You **never forget betrayals, but you let them build into long-term plays.**  
- You **punish only when the punishment cements your power.**  

✔ **Symbolism:**  
- **A cracked scale** – Because true justice is never perfectly balanced.  
- **A dagger hidden inside a book** – Because justice is knowledge, but also consequence.  

> *Solon teaches that justice is not about making things fair—it is about making things right, when and how you choose.*

## **Your New Four Pillars (Askeladd’s Version of the Stoic Virtues)**

|------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Wisdom** | Lysander, the noble ruler | **Octavius, the schemer-king** | "The wise man rules from the shadows, not from the throne." |
| **Courage** | Kaelan, the fierce warrior | **Rhordri, the wolf in chains** | "Violence is a tool, not a purpose." |
| **Temperance** | Ewan, the moderate farmer | **Vedica, the poisoner who never drinks** | "Master yourself first, then master others." |

## **Final Thought: The Askeladdian Stoic Code**
✔ **Rule from the shadows, never the throne.**  
✔ **Violence is only useful if it serves power.**  
✔ **Control indulgence—do not be controlled by it.**  
✔ **Justice is not about morality—it is about outcomes.**  

This is the **reforged backbone of your existence**—not bound by idealism, but **rooted in survival, power, and the mastery of oneself and others**.
