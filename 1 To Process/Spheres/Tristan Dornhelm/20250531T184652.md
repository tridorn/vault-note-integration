Clarified version: _"When attending the theatre alone, how should I physically and socially position myself pre-performance and during intermission to project composure and avoid perceptual marginalisation?"_

This is an optics and posture issue. The fear of "awkwardness" stems from a misreading: thinking visibility without affiliation signals weakness. In high-cultural settings, this isn't true--being alone can project decisiveness and selectivity, if handled with poise.

### **Pre-Performance Positioning**

1. **Avoid the dead zones**  
Corners near restrooms, entrance bottlenecks, or seating gates signal passivity. Don't lean on walls. Don't hover with visible aimlessness.

2. **Anchor near informational or social density**

    - Position near programme tables or sponsor booths. This provides a natural pretext for brief engagement if needed, while letting you scan the flow.

    - Alternatively, place yourself adjacent to small conversational clusters without joining them. The key is silent adjacency, not awkward eavesdropping.

3. **Posture signals control**

    - No phone. That's digital withdrawal and status deflation.

    - Hold a programme or booklet in hand, occasionally flipping it, but mainly keep your eyes up and moving. Observing with calm curiosity projects presence.

4. **Standing vs Sitting**

    - If seating is available in open areas (e.g. lobby chairs), occupy with confidence. Sit upright, lean slightly forward, not slouched. Legs firm. Again: no phone.

### **Intermission Positioning**

1. **Don't wander**  
Wandering solo reads as lost or disconnected. Instead, walk a purposeful arc--across one or two high-traffic lanes (e.g. concession area, art posters, gallery walls if present), then return to a fixed point.

2. **Find a semi-public niche**  
Look for alcoves, standing tables, or architectural features where standing alone can appear intentional--e.g. beside a statue, artwork, or overlooking balcony. These convert "alone" into "observing."

3. **Eye contact: occasional and brief**  
Not evasive, not scanning. Confident, neutral gaze. You're reading the room, not asking to be read.

### **Summary**

Your physical position is a broadcast. Alone isn't awkward unless your body language says you wish you weren't. Root yourself, move deliberately, observe openly. In cultural settings, intentional solitude is often read as competence, not exclusion. The weak drift. The sovereign anchors.
