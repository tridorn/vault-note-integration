**Clarification:** More effectively framed: _"Given my current German tax residency, the need to incorporate a UG now, and a planned exit in 3+ years, provide a concrete, legally robust execution plan to optimise value extraction and prepare for a clean, low-friction emigration."_
* * *

## **Execution Plan: Building Under a German UG with a Future Exit in Mind**

You are locked into three facts:

1. You must **incorporate a UG** now.

2. You are **fiscally resident in Germany**.

3. You will **not exit for at least three years**.

Therefore, your only rational option is **controlled value capture**: extract value legally before it compounds, and structure the UG such that exit tax at year 3 is either (a) fully paid at a low valuation or (b) defused via sale or legal nullification.

* * *

### **Phase 1: Immediate Setup (Month 0--1)**

#### 1.1 **Incorporate the UG**

- Standard template: one-person UG, €500--€1,000 starting capital.
- List yourself as sole shareholder and managing director.
- Register with local tax office (Fragebogen zur steuerlichen Erfassung).

#### 1.2 **Draft Founder--UG Agreements**

- **IP license agreement**:

    - You personally license any IP/code/brand to the UG.

    - Use revocable, non-exclusive terms; peg license fee to future revenue (e.g., 5% net turnover).

    - Must predate any UG-generated revenue.
- **Service contract**:

    - Sign an Anstellungsvertrag with the UG for yourself.

    - Reasonable salary: €2,000--€3,000/month is defensible; low enough to keep income tax under control.

#### 1.3 **Open UG bank account**

- N26 Business or Qonto for speed; Deutsche Bank or Commerzbank for reputation.

#### 1.4 **Get tax number, set up accounting**

- Choose a tax advisor (Steuerberater) to file VAT returns (Umsatzsteuervoranmeldung), corporate tax, and annual balance sheets.
* * *

### **Phase 2: Year 1--2 -- Value Generation Under Constraint**

#### 2.1 **Limit retained earnings**

- Pay out profits as:

    - **Salary** (deductible at UG level, taxed as income)

    - **Dividends** (26.375% flat tax, deferred until payout)
- Target: keep company valuation low by **minimising equity buildup inside UG**.

#### 2.2 **Avoid IP creation inside UG**

- Write code, design, create assets **outside working hours**, outside UG contracts.
- Maintain **proof of personal ownership** (timestamps, Git history, author tags, emails).

#### 2.3 **Track potential valuation**

- Once net profits cross ~€40,000/year or you accumulate >€100,000 in assets, you're entering **exit-tax danger zone**.
- Get an annual **business valuation report** from a neutral advisor to monitor.

#### 2.4 **Do not raise external capital**

- Equity injection raises valuation → hard to unwind later.
* * *

### **Phase 3: Pre-Exit Planning (Start in Year 2)**

#### 3.1 **Form foreign holding company (Dubai, Estonia, Cyprus)**

- Choose a jurisdiction with:

    - Tax treaty with Germany (to reduce capital gains tax friction)

    - Low tax on dividends/income

    - Ability to open a bank account and prove substance
- Incorporate entity 6--12 months before exit

#### 3.2 **Sell UG shares to foreign holding**

- Hire a tax advisor to:

    - Conduct market valuation of the UG

    - Draft **share purchase agreement**

    - File and pay **capital gains tax** under §17 EStG (likely 26.375%)
- This crystallises your taxable event **before exit**; post-sale value appreciation occurs outside German tax reach

#### 3.3 **Optional: IP migration to holding**

- If your foreign entity can legally own IP, assign personal IP to it.
- Have UG license it from the foreign entity going forward.
- Must be priced at arm's length.
* * *

### **Phase 4: Emigration (Year 3)**

#### 4.1 **Deregister from Germany (Abmeldung)**

- Submit Abmeldung form to local Bürgeramt
- Notify Finanzamt in writing of change of tax residency

#### 4.2 **Meet substance test abroad**

- Live in new country **>183 days/year**
- Lease apartment, open bank account, obtain tax number
- Optional but recommended: sign personal employment contract with foreign holding

#### 4.3 **File final German tax return**

- Disclose final capital gains and dividends
- Ensure no UG shares are held at emigration date to avoid §6 AStG exit tax
* * *

## **Operational Model After Exit**

- All new ventures, assets, and compounding occur under foreign holding
- UG remains only as:

    - Passive sales entity for Germany/EU

    - Or wound down
- Personal income flows as salary/dividends from the new jurisdiction
* * *

### **Documentation & Compliance Checklist**

| Document | Purpose | When Needed | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| IP License Agreement | Establish external IP ownership | At incorporation | 
| Share Purchase Agreement | Lock in capital gains tax event | Pre-exit | 
| Valuation Report | Justify share sale price | Year 2--3 | 
| Lease & Utility Bills Abroad | Prove new tax residency | At emigration | 
| Accounting Trail | Track distributions & retained earnings | Ongoing | 

* * *

## Final Notes

- **Yes, this is compliant** under current law--if pricing is fair, agreements real, and filings clean.
- **Avoid artificial constructs.** German tax authorities can pierce anything not commercially justified under §42 AO.
- **Your real risk isn't illegality--it's misexecution.**

If you want this airtight, you will need a German tax advisor fluent in outbound structuring (not just compliance). This is not do-it-yourself territory past year 2. You're playing at the edge of the legal envelope, so the margin for documentation error is zero.
