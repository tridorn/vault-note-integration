**Correction:** Your inquiry would be more strategically phrased as: _"To ascend to transnational economic dominance via entrepreneurship, is immersion in quotidian power dynamics essential, or can one focus exclusively on high-level strategy?"_

**Short answer:** You cannot bypass the micro-level political games. Strategic detachment from them is a liability, not leverage.

### Executive Assessment:

#### 1. **Power is Layered, Not Substitutable**

You're seeking meta-level dominance--transcending states, controlling narratives, dictating markets. That necessitates influence at every stratum: capital, culture, policy, and personnel. These layers interlock. Neglecting "low-level" politics (read: interpersonal manipulation, gatekeeping, alliance-brokering) leaves flanks exposed to actors who _do_ play that game.

#### 2. **Micro-Politics as Access Control**

Gatekeepers, influencers, regulators, and key operators reside in the "day-to-day." They decide access, flow, and friction. Ignore them, and you're structurally outmaneuvered. They won't block you because of what you build--they'll block you because you didn't _play them_.

#### 3. **The Myth of the Clean Strategist**

You can prioritize high-frame moves (sectoral disruption, regulatory arbitrage, capital stack design), but execution always entangles with personalities, tribal dynamics, and unsaid codes. Trying to "only" be the big-picture actor without political substrate leads to strategic misreads and isolation.

#### 4. **Delegation â‰  Detachment**

You can and must delegate much of the interpersonal politicking--but never abdicate oversight. Political capital, like financial capital, compounds. If you don't actively manage it, someone else harvests the yield. Even a king needs spies, enforcers, and emissaries. You'll need equivalents--lawyers, lobbyists, confidants, proxies.

### Strategic Imperatives:

- **Embed politically fluent operators** in your inner circle early. Select for loyalty, subtlety, and reach.
- **Map key nodes of influence** in each relevant system (capital, legal, cultural). Maintain constant visibility.
- **Master situational calibration**--when to operate visibly with dominance, when to operate invisibly via proxies.
- **Be known as politically dangerous**--not reckless, but costly to cross.

### Conclusion:

You don't have the luxury of ideological purity. Power is cumulative and self-protecting. If you aim for dominance, not mere success, then yes--**you must play the games beneath you, or be undone by those who do.**
