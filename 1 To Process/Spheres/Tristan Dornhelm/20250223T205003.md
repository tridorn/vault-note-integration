### **🚀 Travel, Mobility, and Car Ownership as a Global Entrepreneur & Trader**  

Since you’ll be **operating globally**, traveling frequently between **Dubai, Europe, and the U.S.,** you’ll need an **optimized mobility strategy**. Here’s how to **structure your travel**, decide **whether to own a car**, and **choose the best type of car** based on your lifestyle.

---

## **📌 1. Your Core Travel Strategy: Fast & Efficient Mobility**
Since you’ll be **living tax-free in Dubai**, with **business in the U.S. & Europe**, your **travel needs** will look like this:

### **🔹 A) Key Travel Routes**
| **Route** | **Travel Frequency** | **Best Transport Method** |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Dubai ↔ Europe** | Every **1-3 months** | Direct **business-class flights (Emirates, Lufthansa, Swiss)** |
| **Dubai ↔ U.S.** | Every **3-6 months** | **Non-stop Emirates flights to NYC, Miami, LA, SF** |
| **Europe ↔ U.S.** | Every **2-4 months** | Business-class flights (BA, Lufthansa, Delta) |
| **Dubai ↔ Switzerland** | Occasionally (future residency planning) | Short-haul **private jet charter or commercial** |

🚀 **Pro Tip:** Get an **Emirates Skywards status (Platinum)** for lounge access, priority boarding, and business upgrades.

### **🔹 B) Where You’ll Spend Most Time**
- **Dubai:** Main residence (0% tax, global hub).  
- **U.S. (Miami, NYC, SF, Austin):** Business & networking.  
- **Europe (Switzerland, Portugal, Andorra):** Alternative residency, meetings, summer base.  

💡 **Your lifestyle will be ultra-mobile**, meaning a **permanent car in one place might not be the best option** unless you plan to have a fixed secondary base.

## **📌 2. Should You Own a Car?**
Since you’ll be **traveling often**, car ownership depends on **where you plan to spend the most time**.

### **🔹 A) Where It Makes Sense to Own a Car**
| **Location** | **Should You Own a Car?** | **Why?** |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **Dubai 🇦🇪** | ✅ **Yes** | No public transport culture, high-end cars are cheaper, fuel is cheap |
| **Switzerland 🇨🇭 (Future Base)** | ❌ **No** | Public transport is world-class, high costs for ownership |
| **U.S. 🇺🇸 (Miami, Texas, LA, SF)** | ✅ **Yes (if spending time here often)** | U.S. cities are car-dependent |
| **Europe 🇪🇺 (Lisbon, Andorra, Germany, Spain)** | ❌ **No (use rentals or car subscriptions)** | Most cities have great public transport |

🚀 **Verdict:**  
✅ **Buy a car in Dubai** (your main base).  
❌ **No need for a car in Switzerland, Europe, or the U.S.** unless you stay there frequently.  
✅ **For U.S. & Europe trips, use high-end rentals, luxury car subscriptions, or chauffeur services.**

## **📌 3. Best Car Type for Your Lifestyle**
Since you’re balancing **business, high mobility, and a tax-free lifestyle in Dubai**, you want **a car that fits these needs**.

### **🔹 A) Best Car for Dubai (Your Main Base)**
**Top Criteria:**  
✅ **Luxury, performance, & comfort** (since Dubai roads are built for speed & status).  
✅ **Reliable & easy to service** (avoid niche brands with poor service networks).  
✅ **Tax-efficient or low-depreciation models** (since Dubai has no VAT, reselling later is easier).  

🚀 **Top Picks for Dubai:**  
🏎 **Luxury Daily Driver:**  
- **Porsche 911 Turbo S** – Reliable, high performance, great resale value.  
- **Mercedes-AMG G63** – Dubai classic, holds value, luxury off-road ability.

- **Lamborghini Urus** – Ultra-luxury SUV with insane performance.  

⚡ **Exotic Car (if going all-in on Dubai lifestyle):**  
- **Ferrari 296 GTB** – Hybrid, modern, crazy speed.  
- **McLaren 765LT** – Supercar with Dubai resale value.

### **🔹 B) Best Car for the U.S. (If You Need One)**
If you stay in **Miami, Texas, or California** for extended periods, you might want a car.

🚀 **Top Picks for U.S. Use:**  
- **Tesla Model S Plaid** (California, tech hub cities).  
- **Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT** (Miami, Texas).  
- **Cadillac Escalade V-Series** (Texas, NYC, big presence).

In **Switzerland, Andorra, Portugal**, or other European locations, **owning a car is unnecessary** since:

🚀 **Best Option?**  
✅ **Luxury car rentals for flexibility (Sixt, Hertz Prestige, Avis Select).**

---

## **📌 4. Alternative: Ultra-Mobile Car Subscription & Rentals**
If **buying a car doesn’t make sense**, consider **premium rental or car subscription models**.

| **Service** | **Best For** | **How It Works** |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Porsche Drive (U.S., Europe)** | Frequent U.S./EU travel | Monthly subscription for Porsche fleet access |
| **Sixt Luxe / Hertz Ultimate Collection** | Short-term luxury rentals | Rent premium cars on demand |
