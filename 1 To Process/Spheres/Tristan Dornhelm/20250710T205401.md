Clarification of your request:

More precisely: "Define a rational, tightly scoped suite of core software programs that will serve as foundational infrastructure for the Tristan Dornhelm identity, spanning security, knowledge management, communication, and system control. Bitwarden is under consideration--what else qualifies?"

* * *

### Selection Criteria

  

A program qualifies if it meets all of the following:

1. Sovereignty: It returns control to you, not to a platform owner.

2. Portability: It survives across systems and can be reconstituted from backup.

3. Modularity: It plays well in a stack, doesn't dictate the ecosystem.

4. Longevity: It's actively maintained, or simple enough to self-maintain.

5. Resilience: It doesn't require a single point of failure (e.g., cloud dependency).

Rationale

 | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 

Password Vault

 | 

Bitwarden (self-hosted or cloud)

 | 

Cloud-native + exportable

### Integration Model

  

You are not building a collection of apps--you're building a cohesive operations layer.

- All tools must be scriptable or CLI-accessible.
- Data should persist in flat files, git, or declarative configs.
- Everything sensitive must be GPG- or age-encrypted.
- Every critical function (auth, writing, sync, mail, backup) must be restorable from clean system + Git + keyfile.
* * *

### Minimal Starting Subset (Tier 1)

  

To operationalise the identity and its infrastructure:

1. Bitwarden (or self-hosted vaultwarden)

2. Obsidian + vault in Git

3. restic + automated sync script

4. Git + GPG + sops

5. Thunderbird + secure email setup

6. Firefox with profile containers

7. taskwarrior (versioned tasks)

8. Syncthing between primary and recovery devices

9. NixOS (VM first, then metal)

* * *

Let me know if you want this expressed as a flake that deploys the entire Tier 1 stack declaratively, or if you'd like encrypted bootstrap scripts for a trusted-device recovery scenario.
