### **E. Cash Flow Analysis**

**Example for Lisbon Property**:

- **Annual Rental Income**: €31,875
- **Operating Expenses**: €11,781
- **Income Tax**: €5,626
- **Mortgage Payments (if financed)**: Let's assume no mortgage for simplicity.
- **Net Cash Flow**: €14,468/year

### **F. Return on Investment (ROI) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**

#### **1. ROI Calculation**

- **ROI**: (Annual Net Income) / (Total Investment) x 100%
- **Total Investment**: €432,000
- **ROI**: (€14,468 / €432,000) x 100% ≈ 3.35%

#### **2. Consideration of Appreciation**

- **Assumed Appreciation**: 3% per year
- **Annual Appreciation**: €432,000 x 3% = €12,960
- **Total Annual Return**: €14,468 (Net Income) + €12,960 (Appreciation) = €27,428
- **Adjusted ROI**: (€27,428 / €432,000) x 100% ≈ 6.35%

#### **3. IRR Calculation**

- The IRR accounts for cash flows over time, including initial investment, net income, and eventual sale price.
- **Assumptions**:

	 - Hold Period: 10 years
	 - Sale Price After 10 Years: Projected using 3% annual appreciation.
	 - Future Value: €432,000 x (1 + 3%)^10 ≈ €580,000
	 - Selling Costs: 5% of sale price (~€29,000)
	 - Net Sale Proceeds: €580,000 - €29,000 = €551,000
- **Cash Flows**:

	 - Year 0: -€432,000 (initial investment)
	 - Years 1--10: +€14,468 (annual net income)
	 - Year 10: +€551,000 (net sale proceeds)
- Calculating IRR with these cash flows yields an IRR of approximately 5.5%.
