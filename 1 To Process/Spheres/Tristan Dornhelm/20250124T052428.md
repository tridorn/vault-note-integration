### **1. Initial Setup: Building the Foundation**

#### **A. Define Clear Goals**

- Determine **why** you want this lifestyle: freedom, exploration, investment, or all three.
- Decide on the level of luxury or simplicity you want in your homes and travel.

#### **B. Financial Planning**

- **Assess Your Financial Standing**:
	- Calculate your net worth, monthly income, and savings.
	- Define how much of your assets you can allocate toward properties, travel, and lifestyle expenses.
- **Establish Income Streams**:
	- Ensure sustainable, location-independent income (e.g., remote work, online businesses, or passive income from investments).
	- Build a buffer fund for unexpected costs (6–12 months of living expenses).

#### **C. Portfolio Creation**

- **Property Investment**:
	- Identify locations that align with your seasonal rotation and offer rental potential.
	- Work with local real estate agents and financial advisors to optimize purchases.
- **Travel-Friendly Setup**:
