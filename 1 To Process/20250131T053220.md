# Plan and Review Option 2

## Exposition

1. **First Minute (Review of Past Half-Hour Session):**

- Review the task(s) you've just completed. Was the task finished as intended, or is there anything that needs to be carried forward into your GTD system? If a task was not finished, decide what the 'next action' is and capture it in your system.
- Quickly fill in your tracking form based on your performance criteria like energy level, productivity, task difficulty, etc.
- Note down any challenges or distractions that you encountered for further reflection in your more extensive review sessions

1. **Second Minute (Planning Next Half-Hour Session):**

- Look through GTD system and identify the next task or project that needs your attention.
- Visualize the task. What are the steps involved? Do you anticipate any difficulties?
- Estimate how long the task might take. Will it fit into the next half-hour, or will it spill over into the next session?

1. **Third Minute (Adjustment and Realignment):**

- If the task doesn't fit into the next half-hour, can it be broken down into smaller tasks that do fit?
- Based on your energy level and mood, do you need to adjust your plan? Maybe you need to switch to a lighter task or take a rest.
- Are there any distractions that you can eliminate before the next session starts?

1. **Fourth Minute (Setting Intentions and Transitioning):**

- Set your intention for the next session. What do you want to achieve? How do you want to feel when the session is over?
- Take a moment to clear your mind and mentally transition to the next task. You could take a few deep breaths or do a mini stretch to signal the transition.
