**Sample Folder Structure for Areas in the PARA System**

In the **PARA** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) methodology, **Areas** represent your spheres of responsibility and ongoing activities that require regular attention but are not specific projects with defined end dates. Areas are meant to be maintained over the long term and benefit from a shallow folder structure for easy access and management.

### **Principles For Organizing Areas**

- **Shallow Hierarchy**: Limit the depth of folders to keep navigation straightforward.
- **Role-Based Organization**: Align folders with your roles and ongoing responsibilities.
- **Clarity and Consistency**: Use clear, singular nouns for folder names.
- **Regular Updates**: Periodically review to ensure folders reflect your current responsibilities.
