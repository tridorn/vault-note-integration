# Reconciling modern view with stoicism

Your question could be refined as: "I feel some inner resistance toward Stoic teachings, particularly the rejection of materialism and the focus on detachment from wealth and status. How can I reconcile my modern values that place some importance on status and wealth with Stoic principles?"

It's entirely natural to feel resistance toward certain Stoic teachings, especially if your values around materialism, wealth, and status have been influenced by modern societal norms, which often emphasize these aspects. Stoicism, especially in its rejection of excess materialism and its focus on detachment from external success, can feel challenging to reconcile with the more status-oriented goals we often grow up with. However, this tension offers an opportunity for self-reflection and a deeper exploration of how you can live in harmony with Stoic principles without feeling that you have to abandon aspects of your life that you find valuable.

Here’s a way to think through and navigate this tension:

---

### **1. Understand Stoic Detachment Differently:**

It’s important to recognize that Stoicism doesn’t necessarily demand that you **abandon material goods** or **reject wealth**. What it encourages is **detachment**—the idea that your inner peace, self-worth, and happiness should not depend on external possessions or status. Stoics didn’t reject wealth entirely, but they taught that wealth should be treated as **indifferent**—it’s neither inherently good nor bad.

#### **What This Means**:
- You can still enjoy material goods and even seek success and status, but the key is not allowing these pursuits to define you or cause emotional distress if they are lost. Stoicism asks that you **don’t base your identity or happiness** on wealth or external achievements, but rather on living virtuously and practicing reason.
  
- Wealth and status, under the Stoic lens, are **"preferred indifferents"**—things that are not bad to have but should not control your sense of well-being. If you attain wealth, use it wisely and virtuously. If you lose it, remind yourself that your core sense of self has not been diminished.

#### **Practical Thought**:
You don’t have to **abandon** your pursuit of wealth or status, but consider shifting your mindset. Pursue these things if they align with your values, but be mindful not to **attach your happiness or sense of self** to whether or not you achieve them. If you value wealth, ask yourself why, and ensure that your pursuit of it remains within the bounds of **reason** and **virtue**.

**Example**: You can aim for a promotion at work, enjoy the benefits of higher income, and even appreciate the recognition it brings, but remind yourself that these things don’t determine your worth as a person. Your real success lies in how you conducted yourself ethically during that process.

### **2. Explore the Value You Place on Wealth and Status More Deeply:**

Many people feel an inherent pull toward status or wealth because society often reinforces these as measures of success. Part of living Stoically is **examining your values** critically and understanding why you seek certain things. This is an opportunity to **reflect on what status and wealth represent to you**—whether they are fulfilling deeper, meaningful goals, or whether they have become ends in themselves.

#### **What This Means**:
- Stoicism encourages **self-examination**. What do wealth and status provide you with? Are they instruments for achieving something meaningful, like providing for your family, enabling philanthropy, or giving you a platform for virtuous influence? Or have they become ways to seek validation or avoid inner feelings of inadequacy?
  
- If status and wealth serve a **virtuous purpose**, Stoicism doesn’t necessarily demand you give them up, but it encourages you to be **conscious of your motives**. Are they serving your higher self, or are they feeding insecurities or societal pressures?

#### **Practical Thought**:
Reflect on what drives your pursuit of status and wealth. Are these pursuits aligned with your deeper values, or are they attempts to **meet external expectations**? Stoicism doesn’t oppose wealth, but it challenges you to ensure that wealth is used as a tool for **living virtuously**, not as a means of chasing superficial satisfaction.

**Example**: If you find that status and wealth give you the ability to provide opportunities for others, create stability for your family, or contribute to causes you care about, these can be Stoic motivations. But if you find that the desire for recognition or material success is leading to stress, overwork, or feelings of inadequacy, it may be a sign to reconsider your relationship with these pursuits.

### **3. Reframe Wealth and Status as Opportunities for Virtue:**

Rather than viewing wealth or status as things to avoid or downplay, **reframe them as tools** through which you can practice virtue. Stoicism does not necessarily ask that you reject wealth or status, but rather that you use these things wisely to **act justly**, **practice temperance**, and **live courageously**. The real question isn’t whether you have wealth, but whether you are able to handle it with **virtue**.

#### **What This Means**:
- Wealth and status can give you greater opportunities to **exercise virtue**. With more resources, you can help others, support causes that align with your values, or take on leadership roles where you can practice **justice** and **wisdom**.
  
- However, if wealth or status lead to **excess, greed, or vanity**, Stoicism would caution against this. The goal is to remain in control of your desires and actions, ensuring that you don’t let wealth or status **corrupt your judgment** or lead to unethical behavior.

#### **Practical Thought**:
Reframe your desire for wealth and status not as something that defines you, but as something that gives you the chance to practice **temperance**, **justice**, and **generosity**. If wealth allows you to live comfortably, see it as an opportunity to maintain balance, not to indulge in excess.

**Example**: If you achieve wealth, use it in ways that support the common good. For instance, allocate resources toward helping others, creating opportunities, or making contributions to charitable causes. Ensure that your relationship with wealth and status remains one of **detachment**, where you use them as tools rather than as markers of success or self-worth.

### **4. Practice Voluntary Discomfort as a Middle Ground**:

If you feel resistance toward Stoic ideas of simplicity, you might benefit from **periodic practices of voluntary discomfort**. These are exercises where you deliberately **go without luxury or status** for a short period to remind yourself that your well-being doesn’t depend on these things. This can help you gradually build **emotional resilience** and a deeper sense of **indifference** to external wealth without needing to completely abandon it.

#### **What This Means**:
- Voluntary discomfort, such as fasting, sleeping on the floor, or going without certain luxuries, helps you **detach** from the belief that comfort or wealth are essential for happiness. You remind yourself that you can still thrive without them and build a stronger sense of inner contentment.

- These practices don’t require abandoning wealth or status permanently but serve as exercises in **building resilience** and challenging the assumptions you might have about comfort and success.

#### **Practical Thought**:
Periodically practice going without certain luxuries to see how you feel. This helps you build a sense of **inner strength** and reminds you that while wealth and comfort are pleasant, they are not necessary for inner peace or virtue.

**Example**: You might choose to forego dining out for a week or avoid purchasing any new luxury items for a month. During this period, reflect on how it feels and whether it changes your perspective on what you truly need for a fulfilling life.

### **5. Remember Stoicism’s Flexibility:**

Finally, Stoicism is not an **all-or-nothing philosophy**. It allows for personal interpretation and adaptation to individual lives and circumstances. If you find value in wealth or status, Stoicism doesn’t demand that you renounce it completely. Instead, it asks you to **examine your relationship** with it and ensure that it serves a **higher purpose** aligned with your virtues and values.

#### **What This Means**:
- Don’t feel pressured to adopt Stoicism in a rigid or dogmatic way. If there are elements of Stoic philosophy that resonate with you, focus on applying them while acknowledging your modern values.
  
- Stoicism encourages reflection and growth rather than perfection. You can hold onto aspects of status or wealth that feel important to you, as long as you’re mindful not to let them control your **well-being** or sense of **self-worth**.

#### **Practical Thought**:
Take what works from Stoicism and apply it in ways that feel **authentic** to you. You don’t have to fully reject material wealth or status, but you can approach them with **intention**, using them as tools for virtuous living rather than as ends in themselves.

**Example**: If you’re drawn to Stoic ideas of self-control and virtue but also value material success, you might focus on ensuring that your pursuit of wealth remains **balanced** and aligned with your broader goals of **living well** and acting ethically.

---

### **Conclusion**:

It’s natural to feel inner conflict when encountering Stoic teachings about materialism, especially if you’ve grown up valuing wealth or status. The key is to recognize that Stoicism doesn’t demand **complete rejection** of material goods but asks for **detachment**—that you enjoy them without being **controlled** by them. You can pursue wealth and status if they align with your values, but your sense of self should remain **independent** of these external things.

By practicing **self-reflection**, periodically engaging in **voluntary discomfort**, and reframing wealth and status as **opportunities for

 virtue**, you can create a healthier relationship with these pursuits while still incorporating Stoic principles into your life. Stoicism offers flexibility in how you apply its teachings, allowing you to find a balance that aligns with both your values and the virtues of **wisdom**, **courage**, **justice**, and **temperance**.
