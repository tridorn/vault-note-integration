## **Guidance On Smoothie Preparation**

1. **Layering**: Always start with liquids at the bottom to facilitate blending.  
2. **Consistency**: Adjust with ice, milk, or water to achieve your preferred texture.  
3. **Fresh vs. Frozen**: Use frozen fruits for a creamier consistency without watering down the flavor.  
4. **Equipment**: High-speed blenders work best for fibrous ingredients like kale or seeds.  
5. **Storage**: Consume immediately, but if storing, use an airtight container and refrigerate for no more than 24 hours. Stir or re-blend before drinking.
