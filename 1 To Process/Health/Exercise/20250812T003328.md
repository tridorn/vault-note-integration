Love it — let’s make it brutally simple and effective. Here’s a 7-day plan built around Hannibal’s “Around the World” circuit, with just a pull-up bar and dip bars (or sturdy equivalents). Sessions are 30–45 minutes unless noted.

Your 7-Day Simple Plan

Warm-up (every day, 5–8 min):
2 rounds — 10 arm circles, 10 scapular pull-ups (or dead hangs), 10 easy push-ups, 15 air squats, 20–30s plank.

Day 1 — Around The World (baseline)

AMRAP 30–45 min (minimal rest):
	•	5 pull-ups
	•	5 dips
	•	10 push-ups
Record total rounds + any notes (grip, form).

Day 2 — Legs & Core (simple)

AMRAP 30–35 min:
	•	20 air squats
	•	10 reverse lunges/leg
	•	30–40s plank
Optional finisher: 2×60s calf raises (rest 30s).

Day 3 — Around The World (beat baseline)

Same 5/5/10. Aim for +1 round vs Day 1 or cleaner reps with the same total.

Day 4 — Easy Mobility / Active Recovery (20–30 min)

Walk or cycle easy + shoulder, hip, ankle mobility. Light band pull-aparts or dead hangs if you like. No grinding.

Day 5 — Around The World (quality focus)

Same 5/5/10. Keep perfect reps, breathe through your nose, and cut rests. Try to match Day 3’s rounds with stricter form.

Day 6 — Legs & Core (repeatable)

AMRAP 30–35 min:
	•	20 air squats
	•	10 step-back lunges/leg
	•	20 hip hinges (good-mornings) or 15 glute bridges
	•	30–40s hollow hold

Day 7 — Around The World (test)

Go 30–60 min depending on feel. Pace the first 10 minutes, then hold that rhythm. Try to set a weekly PR in rounds.

Scaling (keep it demanding, not sloppy)
	•	Pull-ups: band-assisted or 3 reps strict if 5 breaks form.
	•	Dips: bench/box dips if needed; keep shoulders down and chest up.
	•	Push-ups: incline if needed; diamond/feet-elevated if you’re breezing through.
	•	Stay 1–2 reps shy of failure on early rounds so you don’t crash later.

Recovery & guardrails
	•	If elbows/shoulders get cranky, swap dips for push-ups for a day, or halve pull-up volume (e.g., 3/5/10).
	•	Sleep, protein, water. If you feel cooked, turn Day 5 into a short technique session (20–25 min easy).

How to progress next week
	•	Add 5 minutes to one ATW session or add 1 rep to push-ups (5/5/11).
	•	For legs, try to beat total rounds by 1 with the same form standard.

If you want, I can set daily reminders at your preferred time with the workout of the day—just say the word and tell me roughly when you train.
