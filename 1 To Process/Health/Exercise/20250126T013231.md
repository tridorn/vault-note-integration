Running Cadence

A good running cadence, often measured as the number of steps one takes per minute (SPM), can vary based on individual factors such as fitness level, leg length, and running experience. However, a common target for many runners is around 170 to 180 steps per minute. This cadence is considered effective for promoting efficient energy use and reducing injury risk.

For someone of your profile—23 years old, male, and 185 cm tall—aiming for this cadence range could be a good start. It's important to note that while this is a general guideline, the optimal cadence might differ slightly based on personal comfort and running style. It's also useful to gradually adjust to this cadence if it's significantly different from your natural stride rate to avoid injury.

Using a metronome app or a running watch that tracks cadence can help you maintain your target as you run. Also, integrating cadence-focused drills, like high knees or butt kicks, into your warm-ups can improve your natural ability to maintain a higher cadence during runs.
