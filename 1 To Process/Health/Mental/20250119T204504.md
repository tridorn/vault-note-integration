# Incorporating Standing into CRAPM

Incorporating moments to stand up and move during your day, especially within the context of the CRAPM method, is an excellent strategy for boosting both physical and mental health. Standing and light movement can counteract the negative effects of prolonged sitting, increase energy, improve circulation, and even enhance focus and creativity. Here are some recommendations on how to seamlessly integrate standing and movement into your routine:

## During the Categorise, Review, Adjust, Plan, and Mindfulness Phases

- **Stand Up and Stretch:** Use the transition between these phases as an opportunity to stand up from your desk or work area. Incorporate simple stretches that target your arms, neck, shoulders, and back. This can help reduce muscle tension and increase blood flow.
  
- **Mindful Standing:** During the mindfulness minute, stand comfortably with your feet hip-width apart. Close your eyes, if comfortable, and focus on the sensation of standing â€” the feel of the ground beneath your feet, the alignment of your body, and the movement of your breath. This not only incorporates mindfulness but also the physical activity of standing.

## Specific Standing Activities

- **Standing Deep Breathing:** While standing, engage in deep breathing exercises. The change in posture can enhance lung capacity and oxygen flow, making the breathing exercise even more beneficial.
  
- **Standing Body Scan:** Perform a body scan meditation while standing. Start from the soles of your feet and move upwards. Notice how different it feels to be mindful of your body while standing compared to sitting.

## Incorporate Movement

- **Walk or Pace Briefly:** If space allows, take a short walk or pace for a minute. This can be an excellent way to clear your mind, stimulate creativity, and prevent the stiffness associated with prolonged sitting.
  
- **Standing Desk Option:** If you have a standing desk or a convertible workspace, plan to use it for one of the CRAPM segments. Working while standing for even a short period can significantly reduce the risks associated with sedentary behavior.

## Integrating Standing into Your Routine

- **Schedule Standing Breaks:** Set a timer to remind you to stand and move, ideally at the end of each CRAPM cycle. This ensures that you're not sitting for too long without a break.
  
- **Combine Activities:** Pair standing with another task, like taking phone calls, reading, or even during your review and planning phases. This makes standing a productive part of your workflow.

- **Use Technology Wisely:** Apps and smart devices often have features or can be programmed to remind you to stand up and move around. Leveraging technology can help keep you accountable and consistent with your standing goals.

By thoughtfully integrating standing and movement into your CRAPM method, you're not only enhancing your productivity but also taking important steps toward maintaining your physical health and well-being. Making these activities a regular part of your routine ensures a balanced approach to work and health, contributing to long-term success and vitality.
