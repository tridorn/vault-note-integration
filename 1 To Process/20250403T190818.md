Here’s how to **maximize** your short time in front of ProCredit’s Head of Corporate Strategy & Development—so you **leave with momentum**, actionable steps, and potential buy-in for a pilot.

---

## **1. Clarify Your Goals for the Meeting**

You have two main objectives:

1. **Show** you have a credible, valuable solution (using both the prototype + a brief pitch deck).  
2. **Discover** ProCredit’s internal processes, pain points, and next steps—so you can shape a pilot that aligns with their needs.

### **What You Want Out of the Meeting**
- **A champion** inside ProCredit—someone who sees the value and can push the idea forward internally.  
- **Green light** to explore a pilot or at least a willingness to pass you on to the next decision-makers (like product heads, risk managers, or ESG committees).  
- **Concrete action items**: e.g. scheduling a follow-up call to refine the pilot scope, sharing relevant data, or introducing you to colleagues who handle SME product development.

## **2. Pre-Meeting Prep**

### **A. Build a Short, Targeted Pitch Deck (5–7 Slides Max)**
1. **Slide 1 – Problem & Context**  
   - “Why is green SME financing so cumbersome? Billions go unfunded.”  
   - Quick stat or two.  
2. **Slide 2 – Our Solution**  
   - Show **the big highlight** (GreenBridge aggregator/infrastructure).  
   - Summarize your differentiator in **one** sentence.  
3. **Slide 3 – The Pilot Use Case**  
   - “We start small with rooftop solar for SMEs. Here’s how it works (bullet points).”  
   - Call out the **pain** it solves for ProCredit (speed, volume, ESG compliance).  
4. **Slide 4 – The Prototype Flow**  
   - Quick screenshots from your clickable demo or 2–3 key mockups.  
5. **Slide 5 – Proposed Timeline & Success Metrics**  
   - “3-month pilot, targeting X SMEs, measuring Y.”  
   - (Underwriting speed, # of financed projects, etc.)  
6. **Slide 6 – The Ask**  
   - “We want a chance to pilot with your SME portfolio in [Country/City].”  
   - “We need 1–2 internal contacts and sign-off to proceed.”  
7. **(Optional) Slide 7 – Team & Next Steps**  
   - Show you have a credible team.  
   - Outline “What happens after the meeting,” e.g. scheduling follow-ups, data gathering.

**Crucial**: Keep text minimal; use big, simple visuals. Let **you** narrate.

### **B. Refine Your Prototype Demo**
- Rehearse the **60-second** walk-through: “SME enters data → sees ROI → picks vendor → sends to ProCredit. Done.”
- Make sure any clickable links aren’t broken. Keep a backup PDF or static slides if something fails.

### **C. Prep 2–3 Key Questions for Them**
This is your chance to discover **their** priorities and constraints:

1. **“Which departments or stakeholders typically approve pilot projects at ProCredit?”**  
2. **“How does ProCredit currently assess and process small green loans—any specific bottlenecks?”**  
3. **“Who on your team would champion or sponsor a project like this internally?”**

Having these up your sleeve ensures you learn what you need to shape a compelling pilot.

## **3. Meeting Flow (30–60 Minutes)**

### **A. Quick Intro (1–2 mins)**
- **Thank** them for their time.  
- **1-liner about you**: “We’re developing a frictionless platform for SME green investments, starting with rooftop solar.”  
- Mention you’ll show **a short pitch** and a **live prototype** that addresses their green finance goals.

### **B. The Big Picture—Pitch Deck (5–7 mins)**
- **Share Screen** → walk through your 5–7 slides.  
- Emphasize **ProCredit** and how your solution can help them meet **ESG/portfolio** targets.  
- Make it **conversational**—pause to see if they have immediate questions.

### **C. Demo the Prototype (3–5 mins)**
- Transition from slides to your clickable prototype.  
- **Narrate** the journey from the SME’s perspective: “Here’s how easy it is to finalize an application.”  
- End with a recap: “This process all feeds into a standardized packet for ProCredit’s credit team—saving time and cost.”

### **D. Discovery & Q&A (Remaining Time)**
- **Open it up**: Encourage them to share their biggest concerns or internal hurdles.  
- Ask your **prepared questions** about how they do green lending now, who else you should speak to, what success metrics they value, etc.  
- Listen carefully—you want insights into how to **tailor your pilot**.

### **E. Next Steps & Action Items (Final 2 mins)**
- Propose a **follow-up**: “We’d love to set up a 2nd call to refine the pilot scope with your SME product or ESG team.”  
- Request **any data** you need: “If possible, we’d like info on average SME loan size for green projects, or your typical approval times, etc.”  
- Clarify who is **empowered** to green-light a pilot or an internal test.  
- Summarize your **2-3 immediate actions**: e.g. “(1) Introduce us to relevant colleagues, (2) we’ll refine pilot details, (3) we reconvene in 2 weeks.”

## **4. Potential Objections & How to Handle Them**

1. **“We already have a green loan process.”**  
   - Affirm: “That’s great—this complements your existing process by reducing the manual overhead for smaller deals.”  
2. **“We rely on in-house ESG experts.”**  
   - Affirm: “Our platform **augments** your experts. They’ll spend less time on routine tasks and more on strategic decisions.”  
3. **“Is this secure/compliant?”**  
   - Emphasize your **focus on data integrity**, and that the pilot is minimal risk. “We can work under an NDA or test environment if needed.”

## **5. Tips to Ensure a Productive Meeting**

- **Be mindful of time**: Don’t let the pitch or demo run long—**stay crisp** so you have time for Q&A.  
- **Ask for next steps** explicitly: “Who do you think should see this next?” “Would you be open to a pilot in Q2?”  
- **Listen intently**: Let them talk about their strategy, so you can **tailor** your approach.  
- **Follow up** with a concise email or doc summarizing the meeting’s highlights, decisions, and next steps within 24 hours.

## **6. Concluding Thoughts**

Your **prototype** + **concise pitch deck** + **pointed questions** should make a powerful impression. The Head of Strategy & Development is likely scanning for:

1. **Strategic fit**: Does this align with ProCredit’s green finance push?  
2. **Feasibility**: Is your solution realistic, easy to pilot, not a massive IT burden?  
3. **Potential ROI**: Will it drive more SME loans, cost savings, or ESG compliance?

Show you **understand** their vantage point, keep the discussion **solution-focused**, and you’ll stand a strong chance of **locking in** the next conversation—and eventually, a pilot. 

**Good luck**—let me know if you need any extra details on the deck or the Q&A approach!
