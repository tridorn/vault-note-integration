### **Building Toward Swiss Residency While Expanding into the U.S. Market**  

Your **long-term goal** of moving to **Switzerland** while **growing as an entrepreneur** and **establishing a presence in the U.S. market** is completely feasible. Here’s a **structured approach** to achieving both.

## **1. The Path to Switzerland: When & How?**  
Since Switzerland **makes the most sense after accumulating wealth**, the goal is to **build a high-income business first**.  

### **How to Move to Switzerland as a Wealthy Entrepreneur?**  
There are **two main ways** Switzerland works well for wealthy entrepreneurs:  

#### **🔹 A) Lump-Sum Taxation (Best for High-Income Expats)**
- If you earn **€500K+ per year**, you can **pay a fixed tax (~€100K–€200K per year)** instead of a percentage of your income.  
- This is **perfect for entrepreneurs with international businesses** (where profits are generated outside of Switzerland).  
- **Best Swiss Cantons for This:** Zug, Schwyz, Valais, Ticino (lower lump-sum rates).  

#### **🔹 B) Business Relocation (For Active Business Owners)**
- If you **run a successful business**, you can **move your company to Switzerland** and pay **low corporate tax (~12-18%)**.  
- **Best Cantons for Business:** Zug, Lucerne, Geneva, Vaud (low corporate tax & strong business presence).  

🚀 **Swiss Goal:** **Once you hit €500K+ per year, Switzerland becomes an optimal tax-friendly base.**
