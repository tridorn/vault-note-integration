A more exact inquiry would be:  
**"After relocating to Dubai and waiting out (§ 6 AStG instalments, § 2 AStG ten-year 'extended limited' period, ErbStG five-year estate rule), am I thereafter permanently outside the reach of German taxation?"**

### 1 What really falls away -- and what never does

| Exposure | Sunset? | Why it can re-emerge | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Exit tax (§ 6 AStG)** | _Yes, once paid or cancelled._ | Re-establish German residence later → any new emigration re-triggers on the then-stepped-up value. | 
| **Extended limited income tax (§ 2 AStG, German citizens in low-tax states)** | _Ends automatically after ten assessment years._ | A _fresh_ 10-year clock starts if you move back to Germany for > 183 days in a later year and then emigrate again to a low-tax jurisdiction. ([Rose & Partner](https://www.rosepartner.de/en/taxes-abroad-emigrants-lawyer-lawfirm-germany.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | 
| **Worldwide estate/gift tax (§ 2 ErbStG)** | _Ends after five calendar years abroad (ten only for civil servants)._ | Resets if you re-acquire German residence before death/donation. | 
| **Limited tax liability on German-source income (§ 49 EStG)** | _Never lapses._ | Any German dividends, rent, PE profits, workdays or royalties remain taxable for life. With no DTA since 1 Jan 2022, UAE residents face the full domestic rates (26.375 % on dividends, 15 % on royalties, etc.).

| **Corporate nexus (POEM, PE)** | _Depends on conduct._ | If you run the company from Germany--even intermittently--its profits (and possibly yours) attach to the German tax base. | 
| **Future legislative changes** | -- | Bundestag can extend or re-activate extraterritorial rules; past decade shows willingness (exit-tax fund extension 2025, § 2 tightening). |

### 2 Reality-check on the "tax-free for life" thesis

1. **German-situs flows follow you.**  
Own German shares, real estate, or spend consulting days on German soil and the Finanzamt retains a charging right indefinitely. No treaty shields you in the UAE because Germany terminated the 2010 DTA in 2022. ([Rödl & Partner](https://www.roedl.com/insights/uae-germany-double-taxation-national-disinfection-program-covid-19-travel-dubai-pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

2. **Behaviour, not passport stamps, determines corporate nexus.**  
Board meetings by video from Munich, signature authority on German contracts, or bookkeeping kept in Frankfurt will shift the place of effective management back to Germany, re-creating a corporate taxpayer that drags you in through § 8 AO attribution.

3. **Estate planning remains essential.**  
Die within five years of departure (or still holding German property at any time) and Berlin assesses inheritance tax regardless of where your heirs live.

4. **Return visits are a minefield.**

> 183 days, or simply maintaining a furnished German dwelling available for use, revives unlimited liability immediately (§ 8 AO + § 9 AO). The clock on all "sunset" periods restarts.

5. **Legislation can change faster than your structure.**  
The 2025 step-up of § 6 AStG to cover >€500 k fund positions arrived with three months' notice. Expect similar moves if high-net-worth emigration accelerates.

### 3 How sovereigns lock in the freedom you want

| Lever | Tactic | Pay-off | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Purge German assets** | Hold operating company through a non-German top-holdco; sell or upstream German shares before the move; rent, don't own, German real estate. | Removes future limited-liability flows. | 
| **Corporate substance abroad** | All decisive functions, cash management, IP ownership, board minutes in the UAE; German presence limited to a self-contained PE run by local hires. | Prevents POEM drift. | 
| **Strict day-count discipline** | 60-to-90-day annual buffer; avoid having an apartment "ready to move in." | Keeps residency claws retracted. | 
| **Stagger distributions** | Delay dividends, licence fees, exit bonuses until § 2 window has closed; thereafter they are only German-sourced if paid by a German entity. | Cuts off the 30 %/€62 k income-weight test. | 
| **Dynastic planning** | After five years abroad, shift wealth to heirs via non-German vehicles; keep German property in corporate wrappers so only the wrapper (not the assets) changes hands. | Bypasses ErbStG worldwide reach. |

### 4 Executive verdict

You can reach a point where **Germany no longer taxes _world-wide_ income or capital**, but you are never immune to:

- German-sourced cash flows,
- German-situs assets,
- any future period of German residence,
- legislative shifts that widen the net.

Thus "free for life" is conditional, not absolute. The freedom endures only so long as you **continuously police residence, assets, and management location**. Fail on any of those vectors and the German tax nexus re-activates--without regard to how long you have been abroad.
