The **4-season rotation** for global living typically aligns with the natural seasons in the **Northern Hemisphere** and the **Southern Hemisphere**, but adjusted for climate optimization and cultural events. Below is a general breakdown of months for each season in the rotation:

---

### **1. Spring: March – May**

- **Northern Hemisphere spring** offers mild weather, blooming landscapes, and fewer tourists compared to summer.  
- Best suited for destinations like **Europe**, **Japan**, and **temperate regions**.

#### **Examples**

- **Tuscany, Italy**: Rolling green hills, wine festivals, and warm-but-not-hot weather.
- **Kyoto, Japan**: Cherry blossom season, cultural festivals, and serene temples.
- **Lisbon, Portugal**: Sunny days without the crowds of summer.

---

### **2. Summer: June – August**

- **Northern Hemisphere summer** allows for outdoor activities and exploring regions with milder climates.  
- This is the ideal time to avoid hot tropical areas and focus on cooler or northern destinations.

#### **Examples**

- **Stockholm, Sweden**: Long daylight hours, perfect for island hopping and Nordic summer vibes.
- **Vancouver, Canada**: Beautiful weather for hiking, kayaking, and exploring the Pacific Northwest.
- **Tallinn, Estonia**: Warm Baltic summers and medieval charm.

---

### **3. Autumn: September – November**

- **Northern Hemisphere autumn** offers cooler weather, harvest festivals, and vibrant foliage.  
- It’s also a perfect time for exploring tropical regions that are post-monsoon or cooler highlands.

#### **Examples**

- **Buenos Aires, Argentina**: Early spring in the Southern Hemisphere with warm, pleasant days.
- **Chiang Mai, Thailand**: Cooler post-monsoon weather, ideal for cultural events like Loy Krathong.
- **Mendoza, Argentina**: Spring in wine country, with blossoms and great hiking weather.

---

### **4. Winter: December – February**

- **Southern Hemisphere summer** or **equatorial/tropical climates** provide warmth and sunshine.  
- Escape the cold of the Northern Hemisphere by moving to beach or summer-dominated regions.

#### **Examples**

- **Cape Town, South Africa**: Sunny days, beach weather, and wine country exploration.
- **Bali, Indonesia**: A tropical paradise with consistent warmth (though wet season peaks in January).
- **Queenstown, New Zealand**: Alpine summer adventures, wineries, and lakeside tranquility.
