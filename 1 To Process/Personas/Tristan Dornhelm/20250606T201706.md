**Clarification:** You should have asked, _"Give me a clear, structured overview of how to organise my digital life across multiple roles and devices, with distinct boundaries, responsibilities, and data security controls."_
* * *

## OBJECTIVE STRUCTURE

You operate across **four identities** and manage **six devices**. The key is to prevent cognitive bleed, data overlap, and operational inefficiency. The goal is a **deliberate, modular digital system**: each identity is a self-contained zone, with assigned hardware, cloud infrastructure, communication channels, and data boundaries.
* * *

## I. IDENTITIES (Roles to Isolate)

| Identity | Description | Requirements | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Private** | Personal comms, finances, documents | Privacy, stability, zero business overlap | 
| **Public Persona** | Strategic writing, brand voice, publishing | Speed, creative tools, low distraction | 
| **Eupator (Business)** | Client work, operations, finance | Secure, structured, multi-user workflows | 
| **Employer** | Employment-related duties | Corporate compliance, VPN compatibility | 
* * *

## II. DEVICES (Assets to Assign)

| Device | Assigned Role(s) | Primary Function | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Desktop** | Eupator, backup for all | Data archive, heavy work, control hub | 
| **Microsoft Surface** | Employer only | Compliant, isolated workstation | 
| **iPad Pro + Keyboard** | Public Persona | Writing, posting, concepting | 
| **Chromebook** | Eupator auxiliary, contractor intake | Secure, disposable, browser-first | 
| **Good iPhone** | Private + Eupator comms (dual-SIM) | Primary mobile terminal | 
| **Bad iPhone** | MFA device, content testing, field audio | Offline fallback, testbed | 
* * *

## III. CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE (Per Identity)

| Identity | Cloud Stack | Notes | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Private | iCloud + Proton | iCloud for sync, Proton for privacy | 
| Public Persona | Google Workspace (same as Eupator) | Shared identity space with brand persona | 
| Eupator | Google Workspace (dedicated) | Own domain, own storage, strict permissions | 
| Employer | Microsoft Office 365 | Company-bound, not your infrastructure | 

* * *

## IV. APPLICATION ZONES

Use **strict application containment**: no commingling of tools across identities.

| Function | Private | Public Persona | Eupator | Employer | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Email | Proton / iCloud | Gmail (Workspace) | Gmail (eupator.de) | Outlook | 
| Docs | iCloud / Notes | Google Docs | Google Docs | Word / SharePoint | 
| Calendar | iCloud | Google Calendar | Google Calendar | Outlook Calendar | 
| Messaging | Signal / iMessage | None | Signal / WhatsApp Business | Teams / Slack | 
| Social Media | None | LinkedIn, Medium | LinkedIn (company page) | None | 
| Storage | iCloud Drive | Google Drive | Google Drive (Business) | OneDrive | 
| Notes | Apple Notes | Notion | Notion | OneNote | 

* * *

## V. BOUNDARY CONTROL (Rules of Engagement)

1. **No cross-profile sign-ins**  
Never open business files on personal iCloud. Never check employer email on Eupator devices.

2. **Browser compartmentalisation**

    - Firefox → Private

    - Chrome (Profile A) → Eupator

    - Chrome (Profile B) → Public Persona

    - Edge → Employer

3. **Cloud firewalling**  
No shared Google Drives across identities. Use strict folder access control.

4. **Physical routines**

    - Leave the Microsoft Surface in a locked, employer-only space.

    - Use the iPad only during defined persona-writing windows.

    - Keep the bad iPhone powered off unless in use.
* * *

## VI. DATA & SECURITY POLICY

| Function | Standard | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Password Vault | 1Password or Bitwarden, with separate vaults per identity | 
| 2FA Enforcement | Hardware tokens where possible (use bad iPhone if needed) | 
| Backups | Monthly encrypted backup to external drive (Desktop only) | 
| Device Lock & Wipe | All devices with remote wipe enabled, strong passcodes | 
| Periodic Audits | Quarterly identity review: devices, access, tokens, sign-ins | 

* * *

## VII. DAILY OPERATIONS FLOW (By Context)

| Context | Device Used | Tools Activated | Boundaries Enforced | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Personal Errands | Good iPhone | iCloud, Proton, iMessage | No work apps | 
| Employer Work | Surface | Outlook, Teams, OneDrive | No browser sign-ins to anything else | 
| Writing | iPad Pro | Notion, Docs, Medium | No inbox access | 
| Client Work | Desktop or Chromebook | Notion, Google Drive, Gmail | Work files only | 

* * *

## SUMMARY

You are not building a personal system--you are building four sovereign digital environments. Each must be **logically segmented**, **physically contained**, and **operationally consistent**. No shortcuts, no grey zones.

The payoff: mental clarity, faster execution, lower risk. This structure anticipates scale and shields your attention from entropy.

If you need a mapped-out visual of this architecture (device-to-role-to-tools), I can generate it. Confirm.
