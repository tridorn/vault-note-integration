Your revised request could have been phrased as: "Could you outline a medium-term, cyclical, worldwide travel setup with semi-permanent bases, avoiding short-term hotel stays, and suitable for repeating annually?" Below is a detailed plan:

### **Medium-Term Worldwide Setup with Semi-Permanent Bases**

This plan divides the year into **3-4 regional bases**, where you stay for 3--4 months at a time. Each base serves as a hub for deeper regional exploration, providing stability while allowing flexibility for occasional trips. The setup optimizes for seasonal weather, cost-efficiency, and cultural variety, making it repeatable year after year.
