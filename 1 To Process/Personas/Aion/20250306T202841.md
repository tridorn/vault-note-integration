Askeladd’s relationship with the female sex is **largely non-existent, at least in a romantic or emotional sense**. Unlike many characters in *Vinland Saga*, he never expresses any interest in women, nor does he engage in typical warrior behavior regarding relationships, seduction, or family-building. This is not because he is incapable of attraction, but rather because **his mindset is entirely focused on power, survival, and his long-term goal** (protecting Wales).  

### **1. Askeladd’s Core Approach to Women**
✔ **Detached & Uninterested** – He **never pursues relationships or distractions**.  
✔ **Unsentimental & Non-Romantic** – He does not display **romantic inclinations or deep emotional attachment**.  
✔ **Pragmatic & Utilitarian** – If he ever interacted with women, it would be **for advantage, not personal enjoyment**.  
✔ **No Known Offspring** – Unlike many warriors of his time, he leaves **no family, heirs, or lovers** behind.  

### **2. Why Is Askeladd This Way?**
✔ **His Childhood Trauma** – Askeladd’s mother was a **slave concubine**, abused by his Viking father. He grew up seeing the worst of male-female dynamics in a brutal world.  
✔ **Hatred for Vikings & Their Lifestyle** – Viking culture was **dominated by violence, conquest, and women being seen as spoils of war**—a culture Askeladd despised. He likely viewed most warrior attitudes toward women as **animalistic and beneath him**.  
✔ **No Time for Attachments** – Askeladd had **one purpose: playing the long game**. Relationships would be a distraction or liability.  

### **3. How Would Askeladd Handle Women If He Had To?**
While *Vinland Saga* never shows him interacting with women much, we can infer his approach based on his personality:  

✔ **Charm When Necessary** – Askeladd is a smooth talker; if he had to manipulate a woman for political or tactical reasons, he would do so effortlessly.  
✔ **Emotional Detachment** – Even if he had a sexual relationship, he would treat it as **purely transactional, without attachment**.  
✔ **No Emotional Weakness** – He would never let a woman **hold leverage over him**.

### **4. How Should You Apply This Mindset?**
If you want to emulate Askeladd’s approach to women in a **modern** context, it means:  

✔ **Don’t Chase—Be the One Who is Chased** – Askeladd **never needs anything from anyone**, including women. His strength comes from **detachment and control**.  
✔ **Never Be Controlled by Emotion** – Women (or relationships) should never make you **lose focus on your goals**.  
✔ **Use Charm, But Never Depend on It** – If you interact with women, **be charismatic but unreadable**, just as Askeladd is in conversations with men.  
✔ **Avoid Unnecessary Attachments** – He never **binds himself emotionally to anything that can be used against him**.  
✔ **Stay Focused on Your Greater Purpose** – If a relationship does not align with your long-term strategy, it is **a distraction, not an asset**.

### **5. Conclusion: The Askeladd Model of Relationships**
- **Romantic, emotional, or sexual pursuits are secondary (or non-existent) to greater ambitions.**  
- **If involved with a woman, it is purely for strategy, not personal need or indulgence.**  
- **Askeladd does not despise women, but he does not concern himself with them either.**  
- **His only true loyalty was to his cause—not to pleasure, love, or legacy.**  

If you want to **think like Askeladd**, you must **see relationships as strategic, not necessary**—enjoyable if beneficial, ignored if distracting, and **never something that controls you.**Q
