Rephrasing your statement for lucidity and precision: “I struggle with initiating certain actions consistently, such as eating without distractions, focusing on study sessions, commuting to university, or even getting up upon waking. Recently, I watched a video in which a dog trainer discussed the concept of ‘stacking success’ to condition a dog through incremental achievements. This inspired me to consider repeatedly performing these actions throughout the day to alleviate the resistance I experience toward them—such as driving to university multiple times in succession.”

While your strategy of "stacking success" bears some merit, particularly for reducing aversions by frequent exposure, I would advocate for a more nuanced approach that addresses the core psychological mechanisms underlying these resistances. A framework built on both behavioral conditioning *and* mental reframing might yield far more profound and sustainable results.

Consider the following refined method:

1. **Micro-Habit Structuring**: Instead of taking large leaps, create minuscule, almost absurdly simple tasks as entry points. For instance, if the goal is to study, start by simply opening your books or materials and setting them on your desk without the expectation of immediate, prolonged study. Such minimal actions, repeated, can neutralize your psychological resistance through ease of entry. In your case of commuting, begin by merely getting ready as if you were going to drive to university, perhaps only sitting in the car at first.

2. **Mindful Exposure**: Although driving repeatedly to the university could theoretically alleviate resistance, you risk associating this action with even greater frustration if repeated excessively. Instead, consider brief exposures with an intentional focus on the sensory experience. When commuting, for instance, focus solely on the act of driving—the sounds, the movement, the environmental details—rather than thinking about the act as a necessary precursor to attending classes. This way, you’re reshaping the experience of the commute itself into a neutral or even enjoyable action, rather than a preliminary obstacle.

3. **Cognitive Reframing with Intentional Rewards**: To deepen the “stacking” effect, integrate small, immediate rewards after each successful instance of engagement. This is more than mere "reward psychology"—the reward acts as an anchor for positive reinforcement but also shifts your cognitive focus toward the intrinsic reward of having *attempted* the action. For instance, if you sit to study even briefly, reward yourself with something minor yet pleasurable—a brief walk, or a quick stretch. This helps dissociate each action from its heavier context and establishes it as an isolated and conquerable unit.

4. **Intermittent Compounding**: Lastly, implement periodic assessment points to observe whether your micro-habits and exposures are reducing resistance or enhancing it. Psychological conditioning is most effective when it compounds but remains unpredictable. After a few days or weeks, *slightly* increase the difficulty—study for two minutes instead of one, or drive halfway to university rather than repeatedly to the same spot. The aim is not to force yourself into habitual actions, but to recalibrate your resistance threshold gradually.

While "stacking success" can be a useful analogy, the aforementioned method—a synthesis of minimalism, mindfulness, and cognitive reframing—likely offers greater resilience against the cognitive and emotional friction that obstructs consistent action.
