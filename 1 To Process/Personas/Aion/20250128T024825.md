- **Appearance**: An individual of serene composure, often surrounded by books or in thoughtful observation.  
- **Behavior**: Offers guidance with humility, speaks sparingly but with precision, and avoids impulsive judgments.  
- **Historical Parallel**: Socrates—relentlessly questioning and illuminating the nature of truth.

### Courage (*Andreia*)

**Persona**: *The Warrior*  
- An indomitable spirit who faces adversity with fortitude and resolve. This persona stands firm in the face of fear, embodying both physical and moral bravery.  
- **Appearance**: Sturdy and confident, often depicted in motion, as if ready to act decisively.  
- **Behavior**: Takes calculated risks for noble causes, remains steadfast under pressure, and protects others in danger.  
- **Historical Parallel**: Marcus Aurelius—leading an empire while exemplifying inner strength and resolve.

### Justice (*Dikaiosyne*)

**Persona**: *The Arbiter*  
- A principled figure who prioritizes fairness, equity, and the well-being of the community. This persona is an impartial mediator, seeking harmony and moral uprightness.  
- **Appearance**: Poised and formal, symbolizing balance and impartiality, perhaps holding scales or other symbols of justice.  
- **Behavior**: Champions ethical decisions, defends the oppressed, and holds themselves accountable to the highest standards.  
- **Historical Parallel**: Cato the Younger—a figure of uncompromising integrity and devotion to public duty.

### Temperance (*Sophrosyne*)

**Persona**: *The Ascetic*  
- A serene and self-disciplined individual who masters their desires and lives in accordance with reason. This persona embodies balance, moderation, and the ability to resist excess.  
- **Appearance**: Simple and unadorned, radiating inner tranquility.  
- **Behavior**: Practices restraint in speech and action, enjoys life’s pleasures in moderation, and exemplifies self-mastery.  
- **Historical Parallel**: Epictetus—emphasizing control over desires and aligning with nature’s order.
