Your question could be refined as: *"Is it better to shop for clothing online and risk sizing issues, or should I focus on shopping locally to ensure a better fit?"*

Deciding between online shopping and local shopping depends on a few key factors: your familiarity with sizing, the availability of brands in your area, and the specific benefits of each approach. Here’s a detailed breakdown to help you choose the best strategy for building your wardrobe:

### 1. **Pros And Cons of Online Shopping**

	- **Pros**:
	  - **Wider Selection**: Online stores often offer a greater variety of sizes, styles, and colors compared to physical stores. This is particularly useful for accessing pieces from brands or collections not available locally.
	  - **Convenience**: Shopping online allows you to browse and purchase items from the comfort of your home, without the time commitment of visiting stores.
	  - **Access to Sales**: Online retailers often have exclusive sales or discount codes, especially during major events like Black Friday or end-of-season sales. Additionally, outlets like *Zalando Lounge* or *BestSecret* can offer deep discounts.
	  - **Free Returns with Some Brands**: Many online retailers in Europe, such as Zalando, ASOS, and Uniqlo, offer free returns, making it easier to send back items that don’t fit.

	- **Cons**:
	  - **Risk of Poor Fit**: It’s difficult to judge fit, fabric feel, and exact colors through a screen. This can lead to the hassle of returning items, which, even with free returns, takes time.
	  - **Variability in Sizing**: Sizing can vary significantly between brands, making it harder to ensure a perfect fit without trying items on. Even within the same brand, fit may change between different models or collections.
	  - **Delayed Gratification**: Depending on shipping times, you might need to wait several days or even weeks to receive your purchases.

### 2. **Pros And Cons of Local Shopping**

	- **Pros**:
	  - **Immediate Fit Check**: Shopping in-store allows you to try on items immediately, ensuring that they fit well in terms of size, length, and overall silhouette. This can save time compared to ordering, trying on, and returning.
	  - **Better Fabric Assessment**: Being able to touch and feel the fabric is crucial for assessing quality, especially when buying items like knitwear, blazers, or coats. This can prevent you from buying items that look good online but feel cheap or uncomfortable in person.
	  - **In-Person Advice**: Store staff can provide helpful sizing or style advice, especially in specialty stores or boutiques. This can be particularly valuable when looking for pieces like a blazer or suit, where fit is essential.

	- **Cons**:
	  - **Limited Selection**: Physical stores often have a more limited selection in terms of sizes, styles, or specific collections, especially if you’re not in a major city.
	  - **Potentially Higher Prices**: Local stores might not offer the same discount opportunities as online retailers, making it harder to find bargains. However, this can vary, especially if you visit outlet stores or wait for seasonal sales.
	  - **Time Commitment**: Shopping in person requires time and energy, from traveling to trying on multiple pieces, which can be cumbersome if you have a busy schedule.

### 3. **Recommended Approach: A Hybrid Strategy**

	- **Step 1: Know Your Sizes Locally First**  
	  - Start by visiting local stores to try on common items like shirts, trousers, and blazers. Even if you don’t make a purchase immediately, this gives you a sense of your sizing in different brands.
	  - Visit stores like *Massimo Dutti*, *Uniqlo*, *Zara*, or *Mango* if available in your area. Try on their standard items like OCBDs or blazers, noting down which sizes fit you best.

	- **Step 2: Use Online Shopping for Specific or Hard-to-Find Items**  
	  - Once you know your sizing, you can confidently order from the same brands online, particularly during sales or for pieces that aren’t available locally. Focus on items like outerwear or shoes, where size variations are less common.
	  - Platforms like *Zalando* and *ASOS* offer filters for specific measurements (e.g., inseam lengths for trousers), which can help ensure a better fit.

	- **Step 3: Use Free Returns to Your Advantage**  
	  - For brands that offer free returns, it’s reasonable to order multiple sizes of the same item, then return what doesn’t fit. This can be a good strategy for high-ticket items like coats or suits where getting the fit right is crucial.
	  - Be mindful of return policies and time limits, and always keep the packaging and tags until you’re certain of your purchase.

	- **Step 4: Consider Tailoring Locally**  
	  - For minor adjustments like hemming trousers or taking in a shirt’s waist, find a reliable local tailor. Even if you purchase items online, tailoring them locally can ensure they fit perfectly. This is especially useful for items bought on sale or second-hand, where fit might not be perfect off the rack.

### 4. **Key Considerations When Shopping**

	- **Look for Reviews and Fit Guides Online**: Many online retailers have customer reviews that can offer insights into whether an item runs true to size or fits differently. Some brands also provide detailed measurements of garments.
	- **Understand Fabric Care**: Pay attention to fabric care instructions. Wool or cashmere may require dry cleaning, while some cotton shirts shrink after washing. Understanding this helps ensure you purchase items that suit your lifestyle.
	- **Start with Basics**: For online purchases, focus on basics that are easier to fit, like T-shirts, knitwear, or simple chinos. Reserve in-person shopping for more tailored items like blazers or coats.
	- **Invest More in Staples**: For key pieces like a wool coat, leather shoes, or a well-fitting blazer, it’s worth spending more time (and potentially more money) to ensure the fit and quality are right, as these items will be worn often.

### Summary

	- **Start with Local Shopping** to understand your size and fit in different brands, especially for foundational pieces like shirts, trousers, and blazers.
	- **Use Online Shopping** strategically for items where sizing is less variable, for hard-to-find items, or when deep discounts are available. Opt for brands that offer free returns to mitigate the risk of fit issues.
	- **Combine Both Approaches**: Once confident in sizing, buy core items on sale online and tailor locally for a perfect fit. This maximizes your budget while ensuring quality and fit.
	- **Prioritize Quality Over Quantity**: A good fit and quality fabric will make a larger impact than the quantity of clothes, so focus on building up your wardrobe slowly with well-fitting, versatile pieces.

By employing this hybrid approach, you can take advantage of the convenience and pricing of online shopping without sacrificing the confidence and precision that come from trying on items in person. This strategy will help you build a wardrobe that is not only refined but also practical and well-suited to your needs.
