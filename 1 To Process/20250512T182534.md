Here is your **executive-grade, top-down framework** delineating precisely what a consultant does--and thus what you must master.

Think of consulting as **four clearly defined, logically sequential imperatives**:

* * *

# **The Consulting Workflow: CLEAR**

**C.L.E.A.R.** = **Clarify → Leverage → Evaluate → Advise → Relay**
- **Top-level Logic**:  
Every consulting project is fundamentally structured as follows:
    
    
    [Client Ambiguity] → Clarify → Leverage → Evaluate → Advise → Relay → [Client Action]
    

* * *

## **① CLARIFY -- Define & Structure the Problem**

You move from ambiguity to structured questions:

| Task | Actions | Methods & Tools (Concrete) | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Problem Framing | Turn client request into testable hypothesis. | Problem Statement, SCQ (Situation-Complication-Question) | 
| Problem Structuring | Break down main hypothesis into MECE drivers. | Issue Tree, Logic Tree, Hypothesis Tree (Miro, Whimsical) | 
| Alignment & Validation | Confirm clarity of objective with client. | Quick client calls, problem restatement | 

**Core Output:**

- Defined problem statement
- MECE-structured issues
- Prioritized hypotheses
* * *

## **② LEVERAGE -- Targeted Evidence & Insight Gathering**

You collect **exactly and only what you need**:

| Task | Actions | Methods & Tools (Concrete) | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Hypothesis-Driven Research | Source and pull data explicitly to validate hypotheses. | RAPT Method (Hypothesis → Assumptions → Data → Insight) | 
| Benchmarking & External Validation | Compare to best practices & market references. | Statista, Pitchbook, MBB Reports, Analyst Reports | 
| Internal Knowledge Exploitation | Mine internal resources, prior client experiences. | Internal knowledge base, previous decks | 

**Core Output:**

- Validated/refuted hypotheses
- Clearly articulated insights (1 insight per slide)
* * *

## **③ EVALUATE -- Analytical & Quantitative Reasoning**

Here you build structured models and synthesize findings:

| Task | Actions | Methods & Tools (Concrete) | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Analytical Modeling | Convert insights into quantifiable logic models. | Excel: Driver-based models, scenario analyses | 
| Implication Synthesis | Translate model outputs into conclusions and recommendations. | Pyramid Principle, Slide-based syntheses | 
| Reality Check | Stress-test findings (business sense, partner validation). | Sanity checks, peer-review within team | 

**Core Output:**

- Actionable quantitative analyses (models)
- Structurally robust conclusions (slides)
* * *

## **④ ADVISE -- Formulate Clear Recommendations**

This is your strategic payload--the answer the client pays for:

| Task | Actions | Methods & Tools (Concrete) | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Recommendations Framing | Turn insights & conclusions into client actions. | Recommendation Trees (Option A vs. B vs. C) | 
| Risks & Mitigations | Anticipate risks and trade-offs explicitly. | Risk matrices, trade-off analyses (Pros/Cons) | 
| Roadmapping | Define timelines, dependencies, clear next-steps. | Implementation plans, Gantt charts, phased roadmaps | 

**Core Output:**

- Strategic recommendations
- Concrete roadmap (time/action clarity)
* * *

## **⑤ RELAY -- Executive Communication & Delivery**

Your final phase: package, sell, defend your thinking clearly:

| Task | Actions | Methods & Tools (Concrete) | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Slide Crafting | Create decks that clearly, logically communicate recommendations. | Storyline: Exec Summary → Issue → Analysis → Advice | 
| Storytelling & Framing | Persuasively structure the narrative. | Pyramid Principle, Slide templates (MBB style) | 
| Presentation & Defense | Defend logic clearly; anticipate stakeholder questions. | Backup Slides, Talk Track notes, Q&A prep | 

**Core Output:**

- High-quality presentation decks
- Structured client conversations (logically sound defense)
* * *

## **Top-down Recap: CLEAR**

**C:** **Clarify:** "What exactly is the issue?" _(Structure ambiguity)_  
**L:** **Leverage:** "What specific evidence do I need?" _(Evidence with precision)_  
**E:** **Evaluate:** "What are implications?" _(Analytical synthesis)_  
**A:** **Advise:** "What should be done?" _(Actionable guidance)_  
**R:** **Relay:** "How do I communicate this convincingly?" _(Structured persuasion)_
* * *

## **Consultant's Daily Mindset (CLEAR):**

Every task you undertake falls within **one of these five mandates**. Your internal dialogue:

- **C**: Have I precisely defined the problem?
- **L**: Do I know exactly which hypotheses and evidence I'm targeting?
- **E**: Have I transformed evidence into logical implications?
- **A**: Do I have concrete actions and trade-offs clearly delineated?
- **R**: Is my output structured, persuasive, and defensible?
* * *

This **CLEAR Framework** is your strategic operating protocol--robust, logically delineated, actionable.
