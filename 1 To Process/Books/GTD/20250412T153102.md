# The Three Tiers of Mastery

1 | Employing the fundamentals of managing workflow;  
2 | Implementing a more elevated and integrated total life management system; and  
3 | Leveraging skills to create clear space and get things done for an everexpansive expression and manifestation.

## Mastering the Basics

Other basic practices, which, even if implemented initially, easily regress into incomplete, out-of-date, and therefore dysfunctional usage, include:

- Avoiding next-action decision making on “stuff to do”
- Fully utilizing the “Waiting For” category, such that *every* expected deliverable from others is inventoried and reviewed for follow-up in adequate timing
- Using Agenda lists to capture and manage communications with others
- Keeping a simple, easily accessible filing and reference system
- Keeping the calendar as pure “hard landscape” without undermining its trustworthiness with extraneous inputs
- Doing Weekly Reviews to keep one’s system functional and current

## Graduate Level—Integrated Life Management

Whereas the first level of mastery involves in-trays, meetings, e-mail, phone calls, agendas, waiting-fors, reference systems, list management, getting the right tools, etc., this next tier is concerned with getting rigorous with the bigger issues that are driving the contents of the basic level. These specific actions and information exist because of their relevance to things larger than themselves— the projects we have to complete, the problems we need to solve, the areas of focus and interest we have in our complex lives. Why are you getting that email? What’s the purpose of that meeting, and why do you have to attend? What’s coming up next quarter that you need to start dealing with now? What “projects” need to become “someday/maybes,” and vice versa, because of some of the larger changes going on? Mastery of the fundamentals, which provides the basics of effective and efficient execution, also provides the ability and room to address a higher level of control and focus—projects, and how they are identified, managed, and understood in relation to one another and to the larger frameworks within which we operate. Developing comfort with an external mind frees up and leverages one’s cognitive abilities, paving the way for many more creative and productive uses of an integrated self-management system. The hallmarks of this next level of maturity with Getting Things Done are:

- a complete, current, and clear inventory of projects;
- a working map of one’s roles, accountabilities, and interests—personally and professionally;
- an integrated total life management system, custom tailored to one’s current needs and direction and utilized to dynamically steer out beyond the day-today; and
- challenges and surprises trigger your utilization of this methodology instead of throwing you out of it.

### When Projects Become the Heartbeat of Your Operational System

 Further down the path of mastering this methodology you will reach a stage at which your Projects list becomes more the driver, rather than a reflection, of your Next Action lists, and your projects themselves will become a truer reflection of your roles, areas of focus, and interests. At this point the center of gravity of your self-management system will have moved from the Ground-level horizon to somewhere between Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 (refer to page 55 in chapter 2). Though it is central to an ongoing experience of stress-free productivity, very few people—even among those who have been engaged with Getting Things Done for years—actually walk around with a complete inventory of their projects, objectively and regularly reviewed. Those who do reach this level, however, and come to realize its power, make that the principle list from which they navigate. Given my broad definition of project (any outcome requiring more than one step that you’re committed to achieve within a year), it might be challenging enough for you to delineate all of those, even if they are clear (“Get new tires,” “Fix the printer,” “Find a new babysitter,” etc.). But the real expression of maturity here is the inclusion of the more subtle desired outcomes definable as doable events (“Clarify Frank’s new role on the team,” “Research options for improving Bettina’s math grades,” “Resolve property boundary issue with neighbor,” etc.). A signpost of GTD mastery at this stage—and, indeed, life mastery!—is when one recognizes anything that has his or her attention (concerns, worries, problems, issues, tensions) and translates them into achievable outcomes (projects), to be executed with concrete next actions. Most people resist acknowledging issues and opportunities until they know they can be handled successfully, not realizing that exploring, looking into, or in some way accepting or putting something to bed because there is no solution is an appropriate outcome (project) itself. The ability to create appropriate engagement with your neighbor’s boundary issue, your daughter’s math grades, or the role of a new team member—no matter how ambiguous or unclear the actual path for achieving each may be—by identifying the inherent project and taking steps to resolve it is quite an extraordinary and mature self-management practice.

### Assessing and Populating Your Projects List From Your Areas of Focu

Everything we do is serving some aspect of the roles and accountabilities we have taken on or an area of interest and engagement in our lives. I call my brother just to check in and say hello because “family relationships” has meaning for me. I buy groceries because I consider “health and vitality” important. I produce an agenda for a board meeting because I need to maintain “corporate oversight” in my role in my company. Whenever people actually produce a checklist for this horizon—the areas of professional and personal focus they can identify—they invariably realize that there are more projects they need to add. They will also usually realize that they have not been paying appropriate attention to some aspect of either their work or their personal life, or both, and they are motivated to bring more balance and wholeness to their Projects list.

### An Integrated Total Life-Management System

The third aspect of this stage of mastery is that your system will have become not just a conglomeration of various lists, information, applications, and tools but rather a cohesive “control room” with all its components working together to engage effectively with whatever circumstance arises. You will have attained the ability to customize your lists and categories, and how you use them, in response to changes in your world and your own increasing sophistication with the possibilities. This is a reflection of a functional awareness of GTD. You understand the essence and recognize the value of the various parts of the model and therefore have the freedom to tailor how they are implemented to best serve your needs. You could build your own application of the GTD system from scratch, if need be, with your own tools at hand. You are guided by the principle of creating and engaging with the necessary orientation “maps” to ensure you are appropriately focused as required for a given situation. You’re not at a loss about what to do with anything—a business card you collected at a lunch meeting, a harebrained idea you woke up with this morning about a project you might want to launch, an unexpected private invitation to a major gala event, or your blood panel report from your last medical checkup. You can create the right placeholder for any type of potentially meaningful data. You can also easily get a sense of your priorities for an upcoming trip; you have everything you need at hand for the next webinar you’re conducting; it would take minimal effort to pull together a company overview for your bank; and you can quickly create a rich context for a family conversation about plans for the next two years. You have a dynamic, working dashboard that serves your orientation for virtually any context, whether at home, at the office, or in transit, seamlessly.

### Pressure Produces Greater Rather Than Reduced Utilization of These Practices

One of the most common observations I hear from people who have at some point bought into the GTD process but have not progressed particularly far with it is that they fell away from it because they had an intense series of back-toback business trips, or an extended bout of the flu, or an unexpected crisis occur with a major client, or were asked to run a major project in addition to their regular job, or … and so on. And one of the most common things I hear from people who have matured with their application of and experience with the methodology is that applying Getting Things Done is the very thing that enabled them to negotiate these kinds of tense situations with much more effectiveness and much less stress. So, a significant hallmark of progress in the path of mastery at this stage is that very transition point when issues and opportunities galvanize GTD practices instead of causing its users to abandon them. When a new problem explodes at work, you can get back in control quickly with a new mind sweep instead of taking everything back up into your head. You identify desired outcomes, projects, and next actions about this circumstance as soon as you can, as opposed to simply worrying about what’s happened. You actually do a Weekly Review in the middle of the week because you need that kind of elevated focus to recalibrate your work, instead of reverting back to latest-and-loudest as your priority criterion. Operating at this level of GTD mastery is achievable and truly elegant. The experience, for those who do achieve it, is one of establishing the conditions to flourish. What flourish means and looks like for a twenty-four-year-old rock musician will likely be very different than for a fifty-four-year-old attorney with three kids, but the expanded experience and the process of how they got there with GTD are identical.

## Postgraduate: Focus, Direction, and Creativity

Once you have incorporated the basic elements of Getting Things Done and integrated the more elevated aspects of your commitments of life and work into a trusted and customized systemic approach, the next frontier opens: using clear internal space to optimize your experience, ad infinitum. This mastery level involves two key aspects: Utilizing your freed-up focus for exploring the more elevated aspects of your commitments and values Leveraging your external mind to produce novel value

### Freedom to Engage in the Most Meaningful Things

Once you really know and trust you can and will execute effectively anything that lands in your in-tray, you will have the freedom to toss anything into your own in-tray, whether it’s your next crazy idea, a possible new technology to research, a book you might want to write, or an NGO Web site that almost brought you to tears that you’d like to support. The power to produce produces powerful possibilities.* And, as I hope I’ve made clear throughout this book, the ability to put your attention on the more subtle and elevated levels of your life and work to a large degree depends on your being able to “put to bed” the inevitably necessary more operational and mundane aspects that, without your appropriate engagement, can easily distract and exhaust your creative focus. I applaud the people who can sufficiently compartmentalize their consciousness to be able to draft a movie script, craft a vision statement for their NGO, or write the perfect poem for their wedding vows, with all the stuff of unanswered e-mails, crashed computer, taxes to be filed, mother-in-law’s complaints about the wedding program, and needed bank credit line extension still impinging on their psyches. I do know that if all of those issues were quieted with appropriate engagement from a GTD perspective, the space and inspiration for the more creative activities would be tremendously enhanced. The negative effect on focus and performance of the cognitive load of these kinds of open loops has now been documented. Many people attest to their ability to leave work at work and drop everything to focus on the creative pursuits that interest them, but in my experience that’s only because they don’t have a reference point of what their lives would be like without that pressure to begin with. The lack of pervasive angst about the details of your daily life also makes it much easier to shift your attention to the direction and qualities of experience that really matter. As I indicated in chapter 2, the upper Horizons of Focus— goals, vision, purpose, and principles—are the defining criteria for your priorities. But most people find the ability to concentrate on and execute them effectively elusive at best and avoided (and guilt producing!) at worst. A distraction-free mind won’t by itself get you to think about wild success scenarios five years in the future—you still have to consciously direct your attention to those matters—but it does make it infinitely easier to engage in such an exercise productively.

### Leveraging Your External Mind

 Once you are regularly functioning at this level of mastery, the creative thrust of your “GTD-ing” shifts from implementing the most effective way of dealing with the inputs and inherent demands of your day-to-day world to optimally taking advantage of self-created contexts and triggers to produce creative ideas, perspectives, and actions that wouldn’t normally occur.

> Wouldn’t it be great not to have to think too hard about what you need to think about?

For instance, if you have ever needed to purge and bring up-to-date a contact manager, as you’ve reviewed old and potentially out-of-date entries of people and businesses, you’ve invariably come across items that caused you to tell yourself, “You know, I really ought to get in touch with her again, given what I’m now doing in my business.” If that kind of catalyzed thought has ever turned into something in any way valuable, then you’ve tasted at least a tiny bit of what could be infinitely more utilized. How many more ideas could any of us have had today that would have potentially added value to some aspect of our relationships, work, and creative expressions, had we only brought the right things into our conscious focus with the ability to capture what might show up? This highly creative and productive reflection activity automatically occurs in something like the Weekly Review, when you are glancing at past and future calendar items (“Oh, that reminds me … !”) and updating your Projects and Next Actions lists (“Ah … now I need to … !”). Regularly reassessing your Someday/ Maybe contents offers an even more expansive berth (“You know, I think I really am going to take a painting class!”). But how many other aspects of your experience and relationships could be enhanced with the same kind of triggers for reflection? What other contents, reviewed with some consistency, might reveal valuable ideas? It’s challenging enough to build in regular catch-up behaviors, but the possibilities of going beyond them are endless. This is the stage of maturity along the GTD path of mastery in which the simple idea of checklists takes on sublime significance. As cognitive scientists have validated, your mind is terrible at recalling things out of the blue, but it is fantastic at doing creative thinking about what it has directly in front of it to evaluate. When freed from the remembering function, the mind is a fabulous mechanism to put in play by putting things “in front of the door” so you don’t have to think too hard about what to think about. Howoften would you like to be reminded to think about your significant family members? What, specifically, would be good to remind yourself to think about when you think about your partner, your son, your sister? Whom would you consider to be on your A-list in your professional network (the people whose influence and interactions with you are most valuable)? How often should you review that list? What affirmations and inspirational writings would serve you to reconnect with, and at what intervals? There are obviously an infinite number of opportunities any of us could take advantage of to add value to our world, with the right kind of structure established to relieve our psyche of the jobs it does not do well and to leverage what it does wonderfully. But that will not happen by itself. It is a hallmark of this advanced level of GTD mastery that you recognize that dynamic and use your intelligence to leverage itself. It’s having the freedom to generate and develop ideas, without constraint, and then utilizing the practice of processing and organizing those notes and thoughts appropriately. It’s the smartest individuals who realize they are only randomly in their “smarts” and inspired. They’re the ones who intelligently build in systems and processes to take advantage of the brilliance that often simply lies sleeping behind the dullness required to deal with the brutish world we inhabit. This path of GTD mastery—incorporating the fundamentals, utilizing an elevated and integrated system, and leveraging creative directional focus—is not actually as limited sequentially as I have laid it out. Most everyone manifests aspects and portions of all of these levels in his or her own practices, and I have often met novices in some field who had some extraordinarily advanced moves. But in my experience, when the whole gestalt of stress-free productivity is taken into consideration, it requires a solid progression that does not have shortcuts. You can’t really maintain a sense of week-to-week control if your e-mail is in chaos. You won’t really be free to engage with your long-range planning or vision if you don’t have a grip on the current reality of the actual inventory of your seventy-five projects. You are continually involved in all of these levels, consciously or unconsciously, explicitly or implicitly. You have appointments, projects, actions, goals, and values, and as a professional you will find that your work has its own set of commitments within which you must operate. Your mastery of Getting Things Done will simply reflect the elegant equanimity with which you are engaged with all of them. The unexpected e-mail with the major problem that just appeared, your aunt Martha’s birthday this week, the potential change in strategy for your company, and the new piece of cookware you realize you want —each is dealt with quickly, smoothly, and in an appropriate context, leaving nothing on your mind other than what’s present in the moment.
