A sharper phrasing: "Outline the quickest viable path to stand up the described stack (multi-service experiments on subdomains with shared login and payments), starting from zero."

* * *

## Fastest Path (0 → usable in days)

  

### 1. Core foundation

- Domain & DNS: Register the main domain, delegate to Cloudflare, enable wildcard *.domain.com with proxy + SSL. This unlocks instant subdomain routing.
- Repo: Create a GitHub repo as a monorepo. Init with pnpm + Turborepo (for multi-app).
- Host: Connect repo to Vercel, enable automatic preview deploys. This gives you CI/CD without extra setup.

  

### 2. Identity (cross-cutting login)

- Do not improvise. Pick a managed IdP immediately: Clerk (fastest DX) or Auth0 (more enterprise).
- Set it up on accounts.domain.com. Enable email/password + social logins.
- Configure OIDC clients for:

    - core.domain.com (marketing + account management)

    - *.domain.com (wildcard; services can reuse the same client with redirect whitelists).
- Verify JWTs server-side in each app; never reinvent auth.

  

### 3. Database & backend

- Spin up one Supabase project.
- Create one schema per service (core, notes, images, …).
- Enable RLS by default, tie row access to IdP sub claim.
- Migrations: add Drizzle ORM with SQL migrations in /packages/db.

  

### 4. Payments

- Create Stripe account. Add one Product per service, with free + paid plans.
- Implement checkout using Stripe Checkout (no custom forms).
- Add a webhook endpoint in /apps/core to upsert entitlements in core.entitlements table keyed by IdP sub.

  

### 5. Core site (

### core.domain.com

### )

- Next.js app in /apps/core.
- Purpose: landing, signup/login redirect to IdP, billing portal, list of available services.
- Minimal UI: Tailwind + shadcn/ui.

  

### 6. First service (

### notes.domain.com

### )

- Next.js app in /apps/notes.
- Protect with middleware checking for valid JWT.
- Reads/writes via Drizzle to notes.* schema in Supabase.
- Show "Upgrade" → redirect to Stripe Checkout. On webhook success, grant entitlement.

  

### 7. Developer workflow

- pnpm dev runs all apps concurrently.
- GitHub Actions: lint + test. On merge → Vercel deploy, Supabase migrations run automatically.
- Observability: add Sentry (errors) and PostHog (basic analytics) early.
* * *

## Timeframe if disciplined

- Day 1: Domain + Cloudflare + repo + Vercel deploy + Clerk/IdP.
- Day 2: Supabase project + Drizzle migration baseline + Stripe integration (test mode).
- Day 3--4: Core site skeleton + one sample service on subdomain, protected login + paid upgrade working.
- Day 5+: Duplicate service skeleton for new experiments; iterate.
* * *

## Path to scaling and graduation

- Start everything in one Supabase project and one repo.
- Graduate a service only if revenue proves out:

    - New Supabase project for isolation.

    - New Vercel project for deployment.

    - New domain; keep subdomain as 301.

    - IdP remains shared; no auth fragmentation.
* * *

## Bottom line

  

The fastest path: Cloudflare (DNS), Vercel (hosting), Clerk/Auth0 (auth), Supabase (DB), Stripe (billing), Next.js monorepo (apps). This stack boots in under a week and scales from "toy experiment" to "paid product on its own domain" without re-platforming.

Do you want me to lay this out as a day-by-day action checklist (literally what to click/configure in order), or just the high-level plan you can adapt?
