You should have asked: _"What is the precise role and scope of the Strategic Council within this structure, including its powers to terminate units below the Campaign level?"_

Here is the complete restatement and rational delineation.

* * *

## I. Role of the Strategic Council (SC)

The Strategic Council is not an executive body.  
It is the sovereign core of the company--its **custodian of direction, doctrine, and capital at the highest abstraction layer**.

> It does not manage people or execution.  
It **authorises intent**, allocates resources, and maintains ideological integrity.

### Its 3 primary mandates:

1. **Set Strategic Direction**

    - Articulate strategic theses: where to bet, what to build, what to avoid

    - Define or ratify new Campaigns

    - Decide what constitutes "winning" at the structural level

2. **Guard the Doctrine**

    - Own the canonical doctrine (`doctrine/`)

    - Ratify structural primitives and language (e.g. what a Mission is)

    - Appoint or dismiss authors of doctrine-level artefacts

3. **Control Capital Allocation at the Top Layer**

    - Allocate major capital envelopes to Campaigns

    - Oversee capital exposure across all Programs

    - Enforce capital rationalisation across Campaigns if the system overheats

## II. Kill Authority: What Can They Terminate?

| Unit | Kill Authority | Conditions | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Campaign** | **Exclusive** (SC only) | Always--SC creates, funds, and owns them | 
| **Program** | **Delegated** to Strategic Ops (SO), but SC may override | SC can kill directly, but should generally allow SO to handle unless systemic | 
| **Project** | No direct authority | SC may _recommend_ kill via SO, but lacks executional granularity | 
| **Mission** | No authority | Not the SC's domain--Mission lifecycle is owned by Commanders and SO | 

> The SC cannot micromanage or terminate at the tactical layer without collapsing the doctrine of decentralised execution.

Their job is to **terminate the context**, not the substructure.  
If they don't trust the Programs, they kill the Campaign.  
If they don't trust the doctrine, they rewrite it.

## III. Summary -- Strategic Council in Practice

| Domain | SC Action | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Vision** | Formulate long-horizon aims; define success in strategic terms | 
| **Campaigns** | Approve new Campaigns; terminate ones that no longer match direction | 
| **Programs** | Review progress; allow SO to restructure or kill; intervene only if misaligned at root | 
| **Doctrine** | Guard, ratify, amend structural rules of operation | 
| **Capital** | Allocate top-level budgets; manage inter-Campaign tradeoffs | 
| **Execution** | _Do not touch_ -- they govern structure, not sprints or commits | 
* * *

## IV. Final Doctrine Principle

> **The Strategic Council governs direction and definition.  
It does not command Missions, write Projects, or run Programs.**

The moment it interferes below the Campaign level, **doctrine collapses**, and execution degrades into committee chaos.

Their power lies in veto, not control.  
Their job is to shape the _war_, not direct the _battle_.
