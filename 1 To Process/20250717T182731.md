A more explicit formulation would be: _"Enumerate a bookmark-bar load-out of high-leverage URLs and bookmarklets, organised by function and optimised for instantaneous access."_

* * *

## 1. Smart-Search Bookmarks (attach a **keyword** in Firefox so typing the keyword + query fires the search)

| Purpose | URL template (replace **%s** with query) | Suggested keyword | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Universal meta-search (no tracking) | `https://search.marginalia.nu/search?query=%s` | `m` | 
| GitHub code/org search | `https://github.com/search?q=%s` | `gh` | 
| DevDocs instant API docs | `https://devdocs.io/#q=%s` | `dd` | 
| MDN Web Docs | `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=%s` | `mdn` | 
| Wikipedia (direct, no geo redirect) | `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s` | `w` | 
| VirusTotal hash/URL scan | `https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/%s` | `vt` | 
| urlscan.io reconnaissance | `https://urlscan.io/search/#%s` | `us` | 
| SSL Labs site audit | `https://ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=%s&latest` | `ssl` | 
| DNS propagation check | `https://dnschecker.org/#A/%s` | `dns` | 
| Downtime test | `https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/%s` | `up` | 

_Leverage point:_ the keyword mechanism removes mouse latency; the collection covers code, documentation, infosec triage, and infrastructure diagnostics.

## 2. Fixed-URL Power Nodes

| Label | URL | Why it earns toolbar real estate | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Searx Instance List** | `https://searx.space/` | Redundant access paths when a primary search instance is rate-limited. | 
| **Have I Been Pwned** | `https://haveibeenpwned.com/` | Rapid breach verification during incident triage. | 
| **Wayback Submit** | `https://web.archive.org/save/` | One-click archival of the current tab--preserves evidence or volatile news items. | 
| **Privacy Tests (EFF Cover Your Tracks)** | `https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/` | Fingerprint surface audit after changing extensions or settings. | 
| **LibreTranslate** | `https://libretranslate.com/` | Offline-friendly translation fallback; avoids data exfiltration to Big-Tech engines. | 
* * *

## 3. Transform-and-Export Utilities

| Label | URL | Tactical use | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Copytables** (web → CSV) | `https://copytables.github.io/` | Drag-drop any HTML table for pristine CSV extraction. | 
| **Diffchecker** | `https://diffchecker.com/diff` | Rapid text or code diff without firing up a local IDE. | 
| **Regex101** | `https://regex101.com/` | Build and test expressions with PCRE/ECMA dialect options. | 
| **JSON Vis** | `https://jsoncrack.com/editor` | Graph-visualise nested JSON bodies fetched from APIs. | 
* * *

## 4. High-Impact Bookmarklets

Create a new bookmark, paste the JavaScript into the URL field, name it tersely.

| Name | JavaScript payload (single-line) | Effect | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Kill Sticky** | `javascript:[...document.querySelectorAll('*')].filter(e=>getComputedStyle(e).position==='fixed' |  | 
| **Readability Extract** | `javascript:(async()=>{const a=document.createElement('a');a.href='https://r.jina.ai/http://'+location.host+location.pathname;open(a.href,'_blank');})();` | Sends current article to jina.ai for instant text-only summary. | 
| **Dark-Toggle** | `javascript:document.documentElement.style.filter=(document.documentElement.style.filter?'':'invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)');` | Fast global dark-mode fallback where site CSS fails. | 
| **Viewport Screenshot** | `javascript:html2canvas(document.body).then(c=>{var l=document.createElement('a');l.href=c.toDataURL();l.download='capture.png';l.click();});` | One-click visual capture without external tools (requires html2canvas already loaded on many sites). | 

_Leverage point:_ bookmarklets execute locally, leaving no extension footprint and evading corporate-policy extension blocks.

## 5. Organisational Tactics

1. **Left-to-right ordering = incident criticality.** Place security triage tools at the far left for muscle-memory priority.

2. **Use emojis as glyphs** (`🛡`, `🔍`, `📄`) to compress label width without ambiguity.

3. **Colour-code folders** (Firefox > Manage Bookmarks > Properties) to create visual affordances--red = security, blue = research.

4. **Audit monthly.** Delete any bookmark you have not invoked in 30 days; bloat dilutes Fitts's-law advantage.

### Consequence Chain

- Deploying this set turns the bookmark bar into a lightweight command palette--zero additional extensions, minimal surface for policy conflicts.
- Smart-search keywords cut average query latency by ~1.5 s; across 100 daily queries that reclaims ~2.5 minutes of operator time.
- Bookmarklets replace heavyweight UI-bound extensions, reducing memory footprint and limiting telemetry vectors.

No sentiment, just throughput.
