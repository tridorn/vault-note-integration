You should have said:  
**“Give me a structured diagnostic template—one that lets me analyze any entity (company, team, cluster) using the Corpus framework, with all layers clearly separated and scoped. I want a repeatable format that applies the system rationally and completely.”**

Here is your **Layered Diagnostic Template**—a universal tool for analyzing anything inside an organization using the **Corpus Principia**.

---

# **Corpus Principia – Layered Diagnostic Template v1.0**

**Purpose:**  
To apply the 12 Clusters and 3 Axes to any object of analysis (company, division, team, function, or project) in a consistent, repeatable structure.

---

## **I. Define the Object of Analysis**

| Field            | Input |
|------------------|-------|
| **Entity Name**   | e.g. "Growth Team", "Venture A", "Customer Cluster", "Whole Company" |
| **Level**         | Org / Unit / Team / Function / Cluster / Role |
| **Scope**         | Whole entity / subset of clusters / execution only / structural audit |
| **Typology Match**| Optional: Closest matching archetype (e.g., “Founder-Led Startup”) |

---

## **II. 12 Clusters Scope Check**

Indicate which Clusters are relevant for this object.

| Cluster        | Relevance? | Notes (responsibility, ownership) |
|----------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Strategy       | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| Offering       | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| Structure      | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| People         | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| Work           | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| Customer       | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| Knowledge      | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| Financial      | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| Infrastructure | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| Adaptation     | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| Environment    | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |
| Purpose        | ✅ / ❌      |                                   |

Use this to filter where to apply the 3 Axes next.

---

## **III. Apply the Three Axes to Each Active Cluster**

Use this **one section per cluster**. Example: analyzing the *People* cluster in a startup team.

---

### **Cluster: People**  
*(Repeat this structure for every active cluster)*

#### **Governance Axis (Top-down → Cascading)**  
| Layer         | Rating (0–5) | Notes (who defines, clarity, fit)                    |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Charter       |              | e.g. “No shared hiring philosophy”                  |
| Policy        |              | e.g. “No documented code of conduct”                |
| Directive     |              | e.g. “Slack guideline exists, no hiring rubric”     |
| Operational   |              | e.g. “Unclear onboarding SOPs”                      |
| Evolution     |              | e.g. “Feedback from exits not processed into policy”|

#### **Form Axis (Composed → Constrained)**  
| Layer         | Rating (0–5) | Notes (inheritance, local structure)                |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Juridical     |              | e.g. “Freelancers on vague contracts”               |
| Ownership     |              | e.g. “No one owns team development”                 |
| Structural    |              | e.g. “No clear roles, manager span unclear”         |
| Temporal      |              | e.g. “Team roles shift too often, no retention”     |
| Modal         |              | e.g. “100% async, low visibility”                   |

#### **Initiative Axis (Bottom-up → Executed)**  
| Layer         | Rating (0–5) | Notes (motion style, cadence, control)              |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Source        |              | e.g. “People-related initiatives only come from crises” |
| Mandate       |              | e.g. “No mission-based ownership”                   |
| Cadence       |              | e.g. “No hiring calendar; reactive only”            |
| Control       |              | e.g. “No quality checks on interviews or onboarding”|
| Terminal      |              | e.g. “No structured end to people-related actions”  |

---

## **IV. Scoring & Heat Mapping**

Optional: Convert the above into numeric matrix.

| Cluster     | Governance (avg) | Form (avg) | Initiative (avg) |
|-------------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| Strategy    |                  |            |                  |
| People      | 2.2              | 3.4        | 1.8              |
| Customer    | …                | …          | …                |

> Use conditional formatting or radar chart to visualize execution-health across the organization.

## **V. Interpretation: Diagnosis Output**

| Field                      | Notes |
|----------------------------|-------|
| **Cluster with greatest friction**   | e.g. “People under Initiative” |
| **Axis with weakest presence**      | e.g. “Governance (no Policy or Evolution layers)” |
| **Misalignments between axes**     | e.g. “Mission-style mandates given with tight control” |
| **Inheritable vs. Local tensions** | e.g. “Team using async modal form, but company mandates weekly standups” |
| **Typology fit issues**           | e.g. “Structure resembles agile pod, but mandates imply waterfall” |

---

## **VI. Suggested Interventions**

| Target Cluster | Axis      | Intervention                      | Mandate or Action |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| People         | Governance | Write onboarding SOP             | Mandate v0.3      |
| Strategy       | Form       | Add structural owner (Strategist role) | Immediate assignment |
| Customer       | Initiative | Define quarterly cadence          | Corpus Mission Brief |

---

## **VII. Corpus Compliance Check (Optional)**

| Compliance Item                             | Status |
|---------------------------------------------|--------|
| Has diagnostic been run?                    | ✅ / ❌ |
| SOPs use Markdown+YAML protocol?            | ✅ / ❌ |
| Team has Charter + Directive Layer?         | ✅ / ❌ |
| Typology match assigned and validated?      | ✅ / ❌ |
| Governance Evolution feedback loop in place?| ✅ / ❌ |
