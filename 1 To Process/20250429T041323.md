Perfect.  
Here’s a **fully detailed wireframe** for your **Cvorum landing page**, tailored to the Art Nouveau identity we have started crafting.

---

# **Cvorum Landing Page Wireframe** (Text Blueprint)

---

## **[Top Hero Section]**

**Background:**  
- Soft off-white (light ivory).  
- Very thin, elegant floral/botanical frame pattern around the edges — almost ghosted.

**Center:**

- **Logo** (shield + Cvorum wordmark) — large, centered at top.
- **Main Headline (H1):**  
  > *“Proof That Powers Green Capital.”*  
  (Cormorant Garamond SemiBold, deep forest green, large size)

- **Subheadline (one line of support):**  
  > *We make green financing fast, verified, and safe for SMEs and banks alike.*  
  (Spectral Regular, slightly muted dark grey)

- **Primary CTA Button:**  
  > *“Get Early Access”*  
  (Rounded button, deep green background, muted gold text.)

---

## **[Section 1: The Problem]**

**Layout:**  
- 2-column split:  
  - Left: Large Art Nouveau style heading.  
  - Right: 2-3 short paragraphs.

**Headline (H2):**  
  > *“Today, Green Loans Are Slow, Risky, and Frustrating.”*

**Body copy:**  
  - *Small businesses drown in paperwork.*  
  - *Banks fear greenwashing fines.*  
  - *Governments can’t verify where money goes.*

**Graphic:**  
  - Line-drawing style (monochrome) of tangled vines around documents and clocks (symbolizing delays and complexity).

---

## **[Section 2: The Cvorum Solution]**

**Background:**  
- Very light botanical watermark behind text.

**Headline (H2):**  
  > *“Cvorum Transforms Proof into Power.”*

**Layout:**  
- Three vertical cards (columns), each with an icon and short blurb:

| Icon | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Stylized Ledger | Proof of Compliance | Automatically matches projects to EU green standards. |
| Guarantee Badge | Proof of Security | Instantly attaches public guarantees to lower risks. |
| Smart Meter | Proof of Impact | Continuously tracks project savings — no paperwork. |

(All icons in line-art style, muted gold.)

---

## **[Section 3: How It Works]**

**Headline (H2):**  
  > *“In Three Steps, Cvorum Turns Projects into Funded Realities.”*

**Flowchart:**  
- **Step 1:** SME connects bank account and picks green project.  
- **Step 2:** Cvorum builds a complete risk-proof loan file, guarantee included.  
- **Step 3:** Bank approves with confidence. Money flows.

(Use thin, flowing arrows — echoing organic Art Nouveau curvature.)

---

## **[Section 4: Proof of Trust]**

**Headline (H2):**  
  > *“Built for Banks, Endorsed by Experts.”*

**Content Options:**  
- Space for first partnership logos (even if \"Coming Soon\").  
- Quotes from advisors, early vendors, or even regulatory pre-approval feedback.

**Small note:**  
  - GDPR compliance / green claims compliance badges here — modest but visible.

---

## **[Final CTA Section: Invitation]**

**Background:**  
- Solid muted deep green.

**Text:**

- **Headline (H2), white font:**  
  > *“Shape the Future of Green Finance with Us.”*

- **Subheadline:**  
  > *Be first to access Cvorum’s pilot programs and build a greener economy on proof, not promises.*

- **CTA Button (muted gold background, green text):**  
  > *“Request Early Access”*

**Footer (very small):**  
- Privacy policy, imprint/legal links, simple Art Nouveau line graphic divider.

---

# **Visual Style Throughout**

| Element | Style |
|---------|-------|
| Borders & Lines | Thin, flowing, vine-like motifs. No heavy rectangles. |
| Buttons | Pill-shaped. Subtle hover glow, no harsh transitions. |
| Icons | Single-line art, botanical hints where possible. |
| Animations (if any) | Very gentle fade-ins, no bouncy startup animations. |
| Colors | Max 5 in-use at any time to maintain refined elegance. |

# **Why This Works for Cvorum**

- **Balances beauty and authority:** Looks artistic but deeply structured — exactly your business model.  
- **Speaks the Art Nouveau language** without becoming kitschy or anachronistic.  
- **Shows discipline:** Fewer words, more proof — matching your compliance-driven approach.

---

# **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Load fonts and colors into Figma or Webflow.**  
2. **Wire basic rectangles for sections first** (focus on hierarchy before graphics).  
3. **Commission or source Art Nouveau line-art assets** (Flaticon, Noun Project, or bespoke from a freelancer).  
4. **Draft real copy** (short, proof-based sentences for each section — no filler).

---

**Would you like me next to**:  
- Draft real **example text** for each of these sections (problem, solution, steps)?  
- Or design an **example early-access signup form** perfectly matching the Art Nouveau theme?  

Choose — either path will push you closer to a working landing page.
