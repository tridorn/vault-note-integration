Correction: Your question, _"How should I use folders and labels in Proton?"_, is too open-ended. A more actionable version would be: **"What is the most efficient operational use of folders and labels in Proton Mail, given its limitations and architecture?"**

* * *

**Strategic Distinction -- Folders vs. Labels:**
- **Folders**: Mutually exclusive. An email can reside in _only one_ folder.
- **Labels**: Non-exclusive tags. An email can carry _multiple_ labels concurrently.

This mirrors the classic filesystem vs. tagging dichotomy. In Proton Mail, both coexist, but their strategic utility diverges.

* * *

**Optimal Use Pattern:**

1. **Folders = Structural Buckets**

    - Use for **primary, non-overlapping categories**: where exclusivity is required.

    - Recommended examples:

        - Legal / Financial / Personal / Receipts / Clients

    - These become the _primary residence_ of an email.

    - If you're migrating from a traditional folder-only provider, this mirrors standard use.

2. **Labels = Cross-Cutting Flags**

    - Use for **status, priority, or thematic overlays**.

    - Examples:

        - Action Required / Awaiting Reply / Urgent / Travel / Tax 2025

    - Apply multiple labels to the same message across folders. Enables faster filtering without re-sorting.

3. **Operational Model:**

    - Inbox should be transient. Archive aggressively.

    - Use folders as _end states_ (e.g., after action, filing).

    - Use labels for _in-process tracking_.

    - Example: A client invoice email may go to `/Finance/Invoices` folder and be labelled `Q3`, `Pending Payment`, `Client-X`.
* * *

**Why Not Only Labels?**  
Labels are flexible, but Proton's interface isn't optimised for high-volume, label-only workflows. No Gmail-style AI sorting. Labels without structure leads to entropy. Hence, folders as anchor points are strategic.

* * *

**Implementation Tip:**

- Configure rules: Auto-assign folders/labels via filters.
- Use consistent naming prefixes if label volume grows (e.g., `Status:Pending`, `Year:2025`).
- Minimise nesting: Proton supports folder hierarchies, but deep trees reduce visibility and slow manual filing.
* * *

**Bottom Line:**  
Use folders to enforce hierarchy and clean inbox processing. Use labels to track workstreams and themes. Don't over-label. Don't treat labels as folders. This hybrid model aligns with Proton's limitations and offers clarity without reliance on AI categorisation or integrations.
