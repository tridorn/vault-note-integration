**Correction of your request:**
“Please give me a one that is fit for a company…” → “Please provide a version optimised for a publicly listed, family-led firm where interview data is reviewed manually, yet must retain maximum analytical performance and structural precision.”

---

## DESIGN MANDATE

Audience: **Senior executives and business unit leads at a public, family-led industrial firm (Zehnder)**
Constraints:

* Manual review likely
* Low tolerance for noise
* Need for **immediate readability** + **functional insight depth**
* Avoid over-engineering (no complex schemas), **but no loss of semantic resolution**

---

## CORE STRATEGY

**Condense** by collapsing redundant fields
**Clarify** through naming conventions and strict value control
**Optimise** for manual scanning by using vertically stacked fields (row-per-interview) and **consistent field formatting**

## OPTIMISED INTERVIEW TEMPLATE (STRUCTURE)

### 1. RESPONDENT PROFILE

| Field                  | Format                                                              | Purpose                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Interview ID**       | Auto-ID or Timestamp                                                | Traceability              |

### 2. PROJECT CONTEXT

| Field                       | Format                                     | Purpose                   |

| **Engagement Stage**        | Planning / Installation / Post-Sale        | Lifecycle stage indicator |
| **Project Size (Optional)** | Small / Medium / Large (define internally) | Prioritisation proxy      |

---

### 3. INTERVIEW INPUTS

**Split into fixed categories—1 response per row cell for fast scanning.**

| Field                      | Format                             | Purpose                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Frustrations (Top 1–2)** | Short free-text (max 120 chars)    | Pinpointed pain signals          |
| **Positives (Top 1–2)**    | Short free-text (max 120 chars)    | Clear feedback anchor            |
| **Improvement Suggestion** | Short free-text                    | Customer-led innovation          |
| **Quote Snippet**          | Direct quotation (1–2 lines)       | Voice-of-customer texture        |
| **Sentiment Rating**       | -3 to +3 (manual or NLP-supported) | Normalised polarity index        |
| **Trust Signal**           | Low / Medium / High                | Strategic customer loyalty proxy |

### 4. CLASSIFICATION & FLAGGING

| Field                  | Format                                                                                   | Purpose             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Tag (Theme)**        | Controlled list (max 3 tags): e.g., Complexity / Price / Support / Innovation / Delivery | Thematic clustering |
| **Follow-up Required** | Yes / No                                                                                 | Action flag         |
| **Recontact Approved** | Yes / No / Not Asked                                                                     | Campaign compliance |

---

### 5. INTERNAL CONTROL

| Field           | Format              | Purpose           |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Reviewed By** | Initials / Name     | Audit trail       |
| **Confidence**  | High / Medium / Low | Analyst certainty |

---

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE: HUMAN-OPTIMISED EXCEL / TABLE FORMAT

* **Each row = 1 interview**
* **Fixed-width columns** with short, pre-parsed content
* No nested fields, no multi-selects in single cells
* Design for **scrolling**, not expanding

---

## ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS

If semi-automated parsing is still a future consideration:

* Pre-format **Tag** field with delimiters (e.g., `Price; Complexity`)
* Encode **sentiment numerically** for statistical filtering later
* Use **consistent quotation marks** for free-text entries (if exporting to NLP tools)
