Here’s how you should **consume** these five publications—not passively, but as a deliberate practice that sharpens your edge:

---

### **1. _The Financial Times_ – _Active daily filter_**
- **Morning scan**: 15–20 min. Read the *front page*, *Lex*, and headlines of sectors relevant to you (Tech, Markets, Private Equity, etc.).
- **Mental filtering**: Don’t aim to remember everything. Focus on what feels *unusual, contradictory, or directional*—that’s where insight lives.
- **Save for review**: Use a tool like [Reader by Readwise](https://readwise.io/read) or even a private Telegram channel to save 2–3 standout pieces weekly. Revisit on weekends.
- **Skip** opinionated fluff. Focus on data, moves, decisions.

---

### **2. _The Economist_ – _Weekly depth session_**
- **Set a fixed time**: Saturday or Sunday morning, 1–2 hours. Treat it like a strategy meeting with yourself.
- **Read with a pen (or digital notes)**: Summarize key takeaways in your own words. *Why does this matter? Who does this affect? What could this become?*
- **Ignore “global flavor” stories** unless they touch your industries, geography, or capital flows.
- **Use it for second-order thinking**: FT gives you speed. *The Economist* gives you understanding.

---

### **3. _Stratechery_ – _Insight ritual_**
- **Read every essay, slowly.** You don’t skim Stratechery. Each post is a strategic lesson disguised as commentary.
- **Map the logic**: How does Ben go from company moves to market structure to theory? Extract the framework, not the headline.
- **Weekly “What did I learn?” note**: Force yourself to summarize each post in one paragraph. This makes you a better investor *and* founder.

---

### **4. _Not Boring_ – _Inspiration & pattern recognition_**
- **Skim first**: The writing is long. Read titles, section headers, and “The Takeaway” first.  
- **Read only when it’s novel**: If the topic is over-covered (e.g. NVIDIA again), skip it unless Packy’s angle is rare.
- **Use it to build conviction**: Not Boring helps you say, “This may sound crazy—but here’s why it isn’t.” That’s gold for entrepreneurs and early-stage investors.

---

### **5. _PitchBook or CB Insights_ – _Signals & synthesis_**
- **Weekly scan**: Don’t read deeply unless something stands out.
- **Look for clusters**: 3–4 similar fundings in a week = an emerging trend.
- **Create a personal trend log**: Use Notion or Obsidian. Log sectors that show activity, with links. Add your take: “Why now?” “What’s missing?” “Would I bet on this?”

---

### **Overall: How to Internalize**
- **One “Big Idea” per week**: Extract and write down a single idea that surprised or impressed you.  
- **Share, teach, test**: Talk about what you’ve learned with friends, peers, or even on Twitter/LinkedIn. Teaching is the final stage of understanding.
- **Monthly synthesis**: What did you read, what trends did you spot, what bets would you make? This is investor-grade thinking.

Would you like me to set this up as a ritualized weekly dashboard or system? You could plug it into Obsidian or Notion.
