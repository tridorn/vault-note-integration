Yeah, I knew that one might make you raise an eyebrow -- but I dropped it in there on purpose because in Dubai's networking culture, the labels on the door are often less important than the people inside the room.

  

Here's the reasoning:

* * *

### 1. Dubai's "Networking Gravity"

- Many of the most influential connectors in Dubai are not in standard "male-only power clubs" -- they're in mixed or female-led organizations where you meet people who normally wouldn't cross your path.
- The Dubai Business Women Council (DBWC), despite the name, is open to men as guest members or collaborators.
- It's heavily attended by:

    - Senior executives' spouses (who often run family offices or charities).

    - Female founders with government connections.

    - Ministry liaisons for diversity & SME funding programs.
* * *

### 2. It's an Unusual Angle

- Most male expat founders go to the same places: Capital Club, golf clubs, big expos.
- DBWC is a different ecosystem -- and because fewer men show up, you stand out more.
- It's not about "feminine branding" -- it's about market asymmetry: fewer competing networkers, higher chance of meaningful, memorable introductions.
* * *

### 3. High Government Touchpoints

- In the UAE, female business councils have direct links to the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and sometimes the Office of the Crown Prince for SME and diversity initiatives.
- Being in their orbit can mean you get early access to certain grants, trade missions, or invitations that don't hit the public radar.
* * *

### 4. Cultural Insight

- In Germany, networking is often segmented: bankers meet bankers, founders meet founders.
- In Dubai, cross-sector influence is common. Sitting next to the wife of a logistics magnate can be as strategically valuable as meeting the CEO directly -- and in some cases, more so, because they're the ones who arrange private introductions.
* * *

Bottom line:

I'm not suggesting you spend your days in "empowerment brunches" -- but adding one such unexpected network to your mix in Dubai can:
- Expand your reach beyond the obvious business crowd.
- Get you in touch with decision-makers through less crowded channels.
- Give you a differentiated reputation as "the German founder who's everywhere," which in Dubai's perception-driven environment is pure gold.

If you want, I can include that in your First 90 Days Dubai networking map, where this kind of council would be just one of five power-networking channels you'd hit systematically so you're not just "another new expat founder."

  

Do you want me to draw that map?
