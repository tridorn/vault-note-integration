**Public Version – For Imperial Proclamation in Forums, Amphitheaters, and Temples**  
*Designed for the ears of citizens, soldiers, merchants, slaves, and senators alike. A mixture of awe, threat, poetry, and promise.*  
To be read aloud by the **Herald of the New Age** beneath banners of the eagle and flame.

**PROCLAMATIO AETATIS NOVAE**  
*The Proclamation of the New Age*

> *“Romans! Lift your heads. Open your ears. History has ended. A new world begins.”*

By command of **Aulus Vitellius**,  
Conqueror of Tyrants,  
Voice of Roma,  
Bearer of the Flame,  
and now **Lord of the Romans**,  

**We declare the birth of the New Empire.**  
Not hidden behind false republics.  
Not ruled by shadows.  
Not torn by selfish old men in togas.  
This is not the Rome of compromise.  
This is **Rome Eternal**.

---

### I. A NEW ORDER

From this day forth, the **Old Ways are broken**.  
No more lies of Senate and Republic.  
No more chaos of generals turned kings.  
Rome is One. Rome is Flame.  
And the **Emperor is its heart**.

He does not pretend. He does not kneel.  
He **commands**, and the world moves.

---

### II. A ROME FOR ALL ROMANS

- The Emperor has made all citizens **equal under one law**: the **Lex Imperialis**.  
- All cities shall be joined by new roads.  
- All provinces shall have aqueducts, theaters, temples.  
- All children shall learn the language of power: **Latin**.  
- No more tax cheats in silk robes. No more governors who steal.  
- The Empire will see you, feed you, protect you.

---

### III. THE GODS HAVE SPOKEN

Omens were seen above the Tiber.  
Flames danced upon the Capitol.  
Eagles flew east, and then returned west.  

The gods have chosen Vitellius.  
He is **not a god**, but **the chosen vessel of Roma herself**.  
A temple to the Emperor and to Roma shall rise in every land.  
There, prayers will rise for peace, strength, and order.

---

### IV. THE LEGIONS ARE REBORN

- All legions now carry the name of **virtue**, not province.  
- They answer to **no man but the Emperor**.  
- A new academy in Rome will train officers of honor and law.  
- The soldiers are brothers to the citizen, protectors of bread and fire.  
- And every year, they swear loyalty anew, beneath the Eagle and the Flame.

---

### V. TRAITORS AND WHISPERERS, BEWARE

Rome’s eyes are everywhere.  
No conspiracy will fester. No oath will be broken in silence.  
The **Oculi Imperii** see all.  
Those who plot against the Throne, plot against the gods.

---

### VI. THE FUTURE BECKONS

A **second Rome** shall rise beyond the seas, on the Bosporus.  
She shall mirror the first, gleaming in stone and gold.  
From Nova Roma, the Emperor shall command the East.  
From old Rome, he shall hold the West.

The two shall beat like twin hearts—eternal, united, unstoppable.

---

### REMEMBER:

> “Wherever the Eagle flies, there is Rome.  
> Wherever there is Rome, there shall be peace, order, and flame everlasting.”

Bow not in fear, but in awe.  
You live in a time no other shall match.  
You are citizens of the **New Empire.**  
Raise your voices.  
Swear your oaths.  
March into history.

**ROMA AETERNA**  
**VITELLIUS AETERNUS**  
**ORDO NOVUS SAECULORUM**
