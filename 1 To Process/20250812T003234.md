Got it — you’re starting with a Pilot Falcon F (a great expressive workhorse with some flex) and want to build a tasteful, well-curated fountain pen collection that balances function, variety, and collector appeal.

Since you already have a Japanese soft-fine nib, I’ll recommend the next pieces to give you:
	•	Range of nib types (italic, stub, flex, extra fine, wet medium/broad)
	•	Different filling systems (cartridge/converter, piston, eyedropper, vacuum)
	•	Contrasting aesthetics (Japanese elegance, German precision, Italian flamboyance)
	•	Inks matched for the pen & purpose

Here’s your next five acquisitions, each with exact configuration and ink suggestions so your collection grows cohesive yet diverse:

⸻

1. Pilot Custom 823 – Amber Demonstrator, Medium
	•	Why: Legendary vacuum filler with huge ink capacity. Smooth, wet medium nib contrasts beautifully with your Falcon’s precise fine.
	•	Ink pairing: Pilot Iroshizuku Yama-budo (deep magenta wine) — the ink glows through the translucent amber body.
	•	Collector value: Revered among Japanese pen lovers, a “grail pen” for many.

⸻

2. Pelikan Souverän M800 – Black/Green Striated, Broad
	•	Why: German piston-filler royalty. Broad nib offers luxurious wet lines, excellent for shading inks.
	•	Ink pairing: Robert Oster Fire & Ice — shimmering blue with red sheen, made to dance on a broad nib.
	•	Collector value: Pelikans age gracefully, and M800s retain value.

⸻

3. Lamy 2000 – Makrolon Black, EF
	•	Why: Bauhaus icon. Hooded nib, semi-hooded piston filler, stealth aesthetic. EF nib for precision and water-resistant inks.
	•	Ink pairing: Sailor Kiwa-guro (nano-carbon black) — perfect for archival writing, sketching, or official docs.
	•	Collector value: Timeless design since 1966, a must-have in serious collections.

⸻

4. Sailor Pro Gear – Transparent Blue “Ocean” with Rhodium Trim, 21k Medium-Fine
	•	Why: Sailor nib tuning is world-class, MF nib is a Japanese sweet spot for smoothness and line control.
	•	Ink pairing: Sailor Shikiori Yonaga (deep midnight blue) — rich, poetic, subtle.
	•	Collector value: Sailor’s special editions and colorways draw connoisseurs like moths to a flame.

⸻

5. Visconti Homo Sapiens Bronze Age – Stub 1.3mm
	•	Why: Italian lava rock body, magnetic cap, wet stub nib for dramatic line variation.
	•	Ink pairing: Diamine Ancient Copper — complements the bronze trim and lava barrel like a Renaissance painting.
	•	Collector value: Material uniqueness + hand-tuned nib = instant conversation piece.

⸻

Strategic Benefits of This Lineup
	•	Nib variety: F, MF, M, B, Stub
	•	Writing experience spectrum: springy flex, soft Japanese nib, butter-smooth German piston, industrial minimalism, flamboyant Italian flair
	•	Ink flexibility: from permanent blacks to high-sheen jewel tones
	•	Collector credibility: Each pen is either an enduring classic or a high-demand model among seasoned collectors

If we arrange them in a display tray with matching ink bottles behind each, your desk will look like you’re running a private writing museum.

If you want, I can also give you a sixth “wild card” choice — a rare or boutique pen that will signal to any seasoned collector that you’ve gone beyond mainstream grails and into connoisseur territory. That would make the whole set sing.

Do you want me to add that wild card?
