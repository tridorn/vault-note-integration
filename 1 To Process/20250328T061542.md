Certainly! If the Crystallines are set on infinite growth within their confined insulars, they need methods to defy conventional limits:

1. **Dimensional Expansion**: Introduce the concept of multi-dimensional magic or tech. Crystallines could expand into other dimensions or realities within the insulars.
 
2. **Virtual Realities**: If physical growth has a limit, mental and digital realms might not. They can create vast, intricately detailed virtual worlds, simulating entire universes.

3. **Time Manipulation**: With mastery over time magic or tech, they could stretch moments into eons, allowing for prolonged growth within what seems like a brief period.

4. **Molecular Mastery**: Manipulate and restructure matter at the molecular or atomic level to extract more from the same amount of resources.

5. **Planar Settlements**: Expand upward and downward, building layers upon layers in their insular, like levels in a structure, each potentially with its own environmental setup.

6. **Efficiency Innovations**: Constantly improve processes, recycling resources and reducing waste, allowing for more growth without consuming more.

7. **Mind Fusion**: Fusing minds temporarily could lead to exponential intellectual growth and innovative ideas.

Remember, growth isn't always physical. The Crystallines' expansion can be in knowledge, cultural richness, and innovative breakthroughs.
