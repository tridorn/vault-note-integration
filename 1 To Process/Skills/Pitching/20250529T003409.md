Correction: "Reconstruct and elevate the slide design system, making it radically singular--unmistakably authored, unmistakably mine."

--

What follows is a complete reconstitution. No derivative minimalism. No faux-modernist restraint. This is a **bespoke visual doctrine** engineered to embed psychological control, aesthetic authorship, and intellectual hierarchy into every frame. Not "design-led"--_architecture-led_. Brutal, stylised, high signal. No one else could have built it.
* * *

## SYSTEM CODE: **PRAXIS GLYPHIC**

_Positioning_: A slide system that operates like a visual operating system: coded, formalised, non-negotiable. Think visual lawbook, not presentation. It's **less "deck" and more "interface to worldview."**

* * *

## I. STRUCTURAL FOUNDATIONS

### 1. **Trinary Frame Geometry**

Each slide is divided into **three canonical vertical bands**:

- **Command Band** (left 15%): Encodes what the viewer is _meant to do or know_.
- **Core Band** (center 70%): The idea object--image, chart, or phrase.
- **Residual Band** (right 15%): Ambient metadata (time horizon, confidence, velocity, risk level).

This trinary structure is fixed and visible via faint vertical guide lines--like software columns, not slide margins. _You are interfacing with structured cognition, not arbitrary layout._

### 2. **Rotated Navigation Strip**

Each slide features a **vertical nav bar on the far left**, rotated 90¬∞, listing:

- Section name (e.g., HYPOTHESIS, OBJECTION, SIGNAL)
- Slide number
- Total slides remaining

This becomes part of the visual syntax--every slide is visibly part of a larger narrative machine.

* * *

## II. VISUAL STYLE + SEMIOTIC VOCABULARY

### 1. **Base Colours**

- Background: **#EDEBE9 (paper-like warm grey)**
- Text: **#131313 (carbon black)**
- Accent 1: **#E3242B (tactical red)**
- Accent 2: **#548CFF (signal blue)**

Visual tone is not "neutral"--it's **institutional**. Like a financial terminal, not a startup demo.

### 2. **Typeface Stack**

| Layer | Typeface | Usage | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| System Voice | **Lexend** (high legibility, horizontal space control) | All headers and key commands | 
| Human Voice | **Editorial New** or **Ivy Journal** | Use only for 1--2 word quotes or short emotional claims | 
| Machine Layer | **IBM Plex Mono** | For metadata, chart labels, time codes | 

**Rule**: Each slide includes all three typefaces. Their coexistence creates a sense of layered intelligence.

* * *

## III. DESIGN QUIRKS

### 1. **Glyph-Command Syntax**

Each slide begins with a **glyph-command**: a visual + verbal hybrid at top-left.

Examples:

- ‚Æï ASSERT
- ‚ßâ CONTRAST
- ‚àµ EXPLAIN
- ‚à¥ CONCLUDE

These are universal across decks. They function as **thinking verbs**, conditioning the viewer to understand not just _what_ is shown but _how_ to process it.

### 2. **Monoblock Charts**

All charts are built in **thick-block** format--no fine lines, no minimalist whitespace. Think: heatmap meets brutalist geometry. Chart types include:
- **Binary Bar Stack** (yes/no, pass/fail)
- **Path Tangle** (chronology + causality overlaid)
- **Delta Stamp** (chart plus large numeric badge)

Charts live in containers--**never free-floated**. Every visual is treated as an _object module_.

### 3. **Rhythmic Slide Types**

There are exactly **six slide archetypes**. Each has a preset rhythm and layout:

| Type | Purpose | Special Feature | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **GLYPH** | Introduce argument class | Full-screen single word, glyph, and tone | 
| **DELTA** | Show directional change | Central number + block chart + timer icon | 
| **DUAL** | Juxtaposition | Two-column claim/counterclaim | 
| **LATCH** | Lock-in decision | Command verb + consequence chart | 
| **DETONATE** | Break frame | All-black slide + red type + single line of contradiction | 
| **MOBILISE** | Final CTA | 3-line phrase + large glyph-button (call to act) | 

Each type is architected, not styled. You don't design slides--you deploy modules.

* * *

## IV. TEMPORAL + CONTEXTUAL ENCODING

### 1. **Time Codes**

Each argument is tagged with:

- Time horizon (S: Short, M: Mid, L: Long)
- Volatility (Low, Moderate, High)
- Confidence Index (1--5 dots, filled)

Example (shown top-right):  
**H: M / V: High / ‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã**

The slide system **telegraphs confidence and risk** explicitly. This removes passive reading.

### 2. **Context Threads**

Slides are tagged via **thread glyphs** at bottom right:
- üß† = Psychological claim
- üèóÔ∏è = Structural assumption
- üîí = Irreversible
- ‚õìÔ∏è = Precondition

This creates **vertical threads** across the deck, like symbolic hyperlinks. Viewer is trained to think contextually.
* * *

## V. LINGUISTIC STYLE ON SLIDES

- All headers = **commands**
- All captions = **claims with embedded deltas**
- Body text max: **22 words**
- No bullets ever. Use:

    - **‚´∏** for parallel proof

    - **‚äï** for additional layer

    - **‚á•** for tactical suggestion

This enforces a tight rhetorical rhythm. The deck "thinks" in action verbs and symbols.

* * *

## VI. IMPLEMENTATION + DEPLOYMENT

### Tooling

- Master template in Figma with autogrid + glyph dictionary
- Custom chart builder (Flourish / Observable) using block-visuals only
- Export to HTML5-first, PDF second
- Add session UID to footer for deck analytics

### Propagation

- Deploy decks like episodic software releases:

    - v1.2, v1.3, etc.

    - Add "CHANGELOG" slide in appendix noting data, logic, or claim updates
* * *

## VII. STRATEGIC PAYOFF

This system:

- _Feels authored, not designed_
- Signals elite information handling through structure, not verbosity
- Conditions the viewer to engage as if interacting with a **logic machine**
- Makes disagreement cognitively expensive
- Creates _semantic authority_ through internal language and glyph system

It becomes not just a slide style--but a **cognitive protocol**. Once trained, your audience becomes locked into your frame, vocabulary, and tempo.

Would you like this instantiated as a real template (e.g. Figma file), or further developed into a narrative scripting tool?
