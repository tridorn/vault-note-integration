---

If you were to **structure your entire life** toward becoming the wealthiest man on Earth—at the cost of everything else—it would require a level of **ruthless optimization** beyond what 99.9999% of people would ever tolerate. You would not merely be "building a business" or "investing wisely"; you would be **constructing a machine where your own life is an asset to be maximized**, treating time, relationships, health, and emotions as variables to be engineered.  

Here's what such a life would actually look like:

---

# **Phase 1: The Training (Ages 18–30) – Systemizing Yourself as a Weapon**
### **Time Allocation:**  
- **80% Learning & Experimentation** (Deep domain mastery, elite networks)  
- **20% Execution** (Building financial leverage)  

### **Non-Negotiable Priorities:**  
1. **No Distractions:**  
   - No relationships unless they serve your end goal.  
   - No entertainment unless it enhances strategic thinking.  
   - No hobbies unless they provide networking advantages.  
   - No wasted time—every minute is an investment.  

2. **Mental & Physical Optimization:**  
   - Train yourself for **inhuman endurance**—you will outwork anyone.  
   - Become an **intellectual war machine** (finance, AI, economics, geopolitics).  
   - Learn how to **destroy competitors ruthlessly** without emotion.  

3. **Direct Apprenticeship Under the Titans:**  
   - Work directly for the top 1% in investment banking, private equity, AI, or venture capital.  
   - Build connections with billionaires & power players.  
   - Do whatever it takes to enter their **inner circle**—ethics are flexible.  

4. **First High-Value Business Play:**  
   - Start your **first scalable company** in AI, fintech, biotech, or space.  
   - Take **no salary**, reinvest 100% into growth.  
   - Optimize for **equity, not income**—salary makes you a slave.  
   - Burn through co-founders/employees if necessary—**only A-players survive**.

# **Phase 2: Domination (Ages 30–45) – Absorbing Capital & Controlling Industries**
### **Time Allocation:**  
- **90% Execution** (Scaling capital systems, absorbing markets)  
- **10% Learning** (Only geopolitics, black swan threats, and cutting-edge tech)  

### **Non-Negotiable Priorities:**  
1. **Monopolize a System**  
   - Own and control an entire financial, technological, or industrial ecosystem.  
   - Examples:  
     - **Finance:** Control billions in assets (like BlackRock).  
     - **Tech:** Build the next trillion-dollar AI company.  
     - **Energy:** Control supply chains of a vital resource.  
     - **Biotech:** Patent life-extension technology.  

2. **Capital Warfare: Build a Financial Empire**  
   - **No single business model**—own multiple vehicles:  
     - Holding companies, asset management firms, hedge funds, sovereign wealth fund partnerships.  
   - Deploy **debt and capital leverage** to acquire competitors.  
   - Use **government lobbying** to write laws in your favor.  

3. **Operate Above the Law**  
   - Pay the best lawyers to make **every action legal**—or blur the lines.  
   - **Regulatory arbitrage**—shift businesses across jurisdictions.  
   - Cultivate **government relationships**—you need politicians in your pocket.  

4. **No Attachment to People or Places**  
   - Personal life is **100% engineered**—friendships, relationships, and allies exist for function, not sentiment.  
   - Move internationally at will—**tax havens, legal gray zones, geopolitical hotspots**.  
   - No location dependency—operate across **New York, Dubai, Singapore, Switzerland, Hong Kong**.

# **Phase 3: Sovereign Wealth Status (Ages 45–60) – Rewriting Global Order**
### **Time Allocation:**  
- **50% Policy & Influence** (Reshaping governments, lobbying)  
- **30% New Market Control** (Space, AI, longevity, new industries)  
- **20% Maintenance** (Wealth preservation, dynastic planning)  

### **Non-Negotiable Priorities:**  
1. **Global Power Play**  
   - No longer just a business mogul—you must influence **international policy**.  
   - Fund **think tanks, intelligence agencies, and academic institutions**.  
   - Shape global narratives via **media control** (news, social platforms).  

2. **Complete Wealth Control Mechanism**  
   - Your wealth must be **unbreakable and systematized** via:  
     - Offshore structures (Bermuda, Switzerland, Cayman Islands).  
     - **Private equity ownership of critical industries**.  
     - **AI-driven financial markets manipulation** (HFT, dark pools).  

3. **Industry Domination Beyond Earth**  
   - Colonize space commerce before competitors (asteroid mining, planetary energy).  
   - Dominate **the post-AI economy**—whoever controls AGI controls **everything**.  
   - Expand into **longevity biotech**—buy time to ensure your empire lasts.  

4. **Transition to Godhood (Legacy Mode)**  
   - Ensure **your name lives for centuries** (foundations, institutions, mega-monuments).  
   - Your dynasty must **control financial systems for generations**.  
   - Build infrastructure to maintain **intergenerational wealth concentration**.

# **The Cost of This Life**
If you **truly** commit to this, you must **sacrifice everything**:  
- **Personal relationships?** Superficial, transactional, disposable.  
- **Happiness?** A function of progress, not leisure.  
- **Morality?** A tool, not a limitation.  
- **Privacy?** Unnecessary—power requires exposure.  
- **Stability?** Abandoned in favor of relentless expansion.  

This is not a normal human existence. You are not building a career or a company. **You are building a self-perpetuating empire that outlives you.** The vast majority of people *cannot* and *will not* tolerate this life.

# **Final Question: Do You Really Want This?**
The **richest men in history** (Rockefeller, Carnegie, Bezos, Musk) were not normal. They were **relentless**, **paranoid**, and **ruthless**. If you genuinely commit, **you will not recognize yourself in 10 years.**  

Are you prepared to **become something non-human** in the pursuit of absolute wealth? Or is there a **better** objective where you can balance power and meaning?
