# Critical Thinking (and Critical thinking)

Critical, criticism and critic originate from the Greek word kritikos (= being able to judge, discern, decide)

Critical Thinking = academic discipline

critical thinking = act of thinking critically

Arguments are in particular interest of CT (Critical Thinking) but the field is not reduced to it. 

Information, items of evidence, statements and assertions, explanations, dialogues, statistics, news stories, advertisements do need to be considered critically.

They make claims - statements that are meant to be true but can possibly be false.

Arguments try to persuade or influence an audience in favour of certain claims.

The critical question is whether these arguments succeed or fail.
