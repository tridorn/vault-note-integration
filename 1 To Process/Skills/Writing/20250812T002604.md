Yes—you can absolutely use shorthand for note-taking during classes, and it’s actually one of the original, most effective use cases for it.

But let’s break it down rationally so you know when it works well, what to watch out for, and how to make it sustainable.

⸻

✅ When shorthand works brilliantly in class

🧠 1. Lecture-heavy classes

Where your goal is to capture what’s said, shorthand shines:
	•	History
	•	Sociology
	•	Psychology
	•	Business
	•	Law
	•	Any course with long explanations or examples

Shorthand lets you:
	•	Keep up with fast-talking instructors
	•	Focus on meaning instead of spelling
	•	Leave class with complete notes (no “will fill in later” gaps)

⸻

✍️ 2. Conceptual or idea-based content
	•	You can jot down ideas, flow of arguments, cause-effect, quotes, etc. quickly.
	•	It’s great for visual thinkers: arrows, diagrams, and shorthand fragments pair well.

⸻

🔐 3. Private processing
	•	You can make personal annotations (e.g., “confusing,” “ask later,” “this will be on test!”) that others can’t read.
	•	You can take more honest notes—especially useful in grad seminars or group discussions.

⸻

⚠️ When shorthand is less ideal in class

📊 1. Formula-heavy or symbolic courses

In math, physics, computer science, or engineering:
	•	Shorthand offers little benefit—formulas don’t compress well.
	•	Diagrams, code snippets, or formal notation usually outperform shorthand.

✅ Better to stick to standard notation + maybe annotate around it using shorthand.

⸻

💬 2. When there’s lots of class discussion

If students speak back-and-forth rapidly, shorthand can help—but:
	•	You need skill in quickly identifying what’s important to capture.
	•	You may miss the nuance of a conversation while writing.

In these cases, shorthand is useful for summarizing your own reflections or observations afterward.

⸻

⏱️ 3. If you’re still early in learning

If you’re just starting out:
	•	You may fall behind trying to remember outlines.
	•	You might miss content trying to “get it right.”

✅ Instead: use hybrid notes
Example:

Prof: “Influence ≠ power → often indirect”
✦ infl ≠ powr → ind?
✧ eg: prof → grade threat

This uses part-English, part-shorthand—easy to expand later.

🔧 How to make shorthand work in class

Strategy	Why it helps
Use a hybrid system	Write common words (e.g. “and”, “is”, “the”) in shorthand, the rest in longhand until you’re faster
Leave space	Skip anything you didn’t catch—leave a line and fill it in post-class
Review quickly	Reread your notes within 12–24 hours to reinforce both meaning and outline memory
Summarize after	Write a 5–10 line full-English summary after each session—it cements learning and creates searchable notes
Use symbols	Use visual tags for tasks, questions, key terms, or definitions (✦ ☑ ? ⊕ ⤷ etc.)

🧭 Bottom Line

Question	Answer
Can I use shorthand in class?	Yes—especially in lecture-based, discussion-light courses
Is it worth it?	Yes, long-term. It trains your listening, compression, and memory
Is it always ideal?	No. In STEM-heavy or fast-paced discussion settings, use a hybrid
Should I start now as a beginner?	Yes—but mix with longhand while you’re still ramping up
