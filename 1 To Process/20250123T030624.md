Your idea to pilot the initiative by addressing a tangible problem is an excellent way to kickstart the project and demonstrate its potential impact. The issue you've identified—lack of facilities for cyclists to change clothes after commuting—is both practical and likely affects a significant number of students. Implementing simple changing cabins could greatly enhance the commuting experience for cyclists and encourage more students to adopt cycling as a mode of transport.

### Steps to Develop Your Pilot Project

1. **Data Collection and Needs Assessment**:
	- **Survey Cyclists**: Create a survey targeting students who bike to university to gauge the demand for changing facilities. Include questions about their current challenges, interest in changing cabins, and any additional needs (e.g., lockers, showers).
	- **Campus-Wide Poll**: Extend the survey to all students to assess whether the lack of changing facilities is a barrier preventing them from cycling to campus.

2. **Analyze the Data**:
	- **Quantify Demand**: Use the collected data to estimate the number of students who would benefit from the changing cabins.
	- **Identify Key Insights**: Look for patterns or common themes in the feedback to strengthen your proposal.

3. **Develop a Proposal**:
	- **Outline the Benefits**:
	  - **For Students**: Improved comfort, hygiene, and convenience; promotes a healthy lifestyle.
	  - **For the University**: Encourages sustainable transportation, reduces parking demand, and aligns with environmental initiatives.
	- **Design and Logistics**:
	  - **Cabin Specifications**: Simple, cost-effective designs similar to beach changing rooms.
	  - **Location**: Propose strategic locations on campus where cyclist traffic is highest.
	  - **Maintenance Plan**: Outline how the cabins will be kept clean and secure.
	- **Budget Estimation**: Provide a rough cost analysis, including construction, installation, and maintenance.

4. **Engage Stakeholders**:
	- **University Administration**: Present your proposal to the facilities management or campus planning department.
	- **Student Associations**: Gain support from student councils or environmental clubs to strengthen your case.
	- **Local Businesses**: Explore sponsorship opportunities with local cycling shops or companies promoting sustainable transportation.

5. **Pilot Implementation Plan**:
	- **Start Small**: Propose installing one or two cabins as a trial to assess usage and gather feedback.
	- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Set up a system to monitor the cabins' usage and collect ongoing feedback from users.

6. **Marketing and Communication**:
	- **Awareness Campaign**: Use social media, campus newsletters, and flyers to inform students about the new facilities.
	- **Highlight the Initiative**: Emphasize that this project is part of a larger student-led effort to improve campus life through data-driven solutions.

7. **Gather Feedback and Iterate**:
	- **User Experience Surveys**: After a set period, survey users to assess satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
	- **Adjust Accordingly**: Use the feedback to refine the facilities and plan for potential expansion.

### Potential Challenges and Solutions

- **Funding Constraints**: If budget is a concern, consider crowdfunding within the university community or applying for grants focused on sustainability initiatives.
- **Administrative Hurdles**: Navigating university bureaucracy can be challenging. Gaining support from faculty members or departments aligned with environmental or student welfare goals can help advocate for your project.
- **Security Concerns**: Address potential concerns about safety by proposing measures like proper lighting, regular security patrols, or even CCTV in the vicinity (while respecting privacy within the cabins).

### Aligning with the Initiative's Goals

- **Skill Development**: This project allows participating students to engage in the full spectrum of project development—from data collection and analysis to proposal writing and implementation.
- **Enhancing University Culture**: By addressing a common problem, you foster a sense of community and demonstrate the tangible impact of student-led initiatives.
- **Foundation for Future Projects**: Successfully implementing this pilot sets a precedent for future projects, showcasing the initiative's capability to effect positive change on campus.

### Expanding the Impact

- **Sustainability Focus**: Position the project within the broader context of environmental sustainability, potentially attracting attention from relevant university departments or external organizations.
- **Replication at Other Universities**: If successful, document the process and results to create a case study that can be shared with initiatives at other universities (e.g., BrauchtLMU, BrauchtTUM).

### Final Thoughts

Starting with a concrete and relatable project like the installation of changing cabins addresses an immediate need and exemplifies the initiative's mission to improve university life through practical, data-informed solutions. It balances the seriousness of solving a real problem with the initiative's cultural and community-building goals.

By approaching this project methodically—grounded in data and bolstered by collaborative efforts—you increase the likelihood of successful implementation and set a strong foundation for the future of your student initiative.
