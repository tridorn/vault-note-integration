Perfect. Below is a **complete guide and annotated rationale** for your lifecycle-based **Obsidian folder structure**. This includes:

1. **Folder map** (top-level and key subfolders)

2. **What belongs where** -- rules and edge-case handling

3. **Folder transitions** -- when and how to move notes

4. **Maintenance schedule**

5. **Optional enhancements** (naming conventions, Git hooks, etc.)

## 📂 Folder Structure Overview
    
    
    00_System/        # System-only: templates, scripts, assets, logs
    01_Capture/       # Raw, unprocessed notes (shortest possible stay)
    02_Triage/        # Clarifying + routing stage (action, defer, delete, reference)
    03_Nurture/       # Ideas and backlogs not yet committed to action
    04_Plan/          # Active commitments: projects, tasks, timelines
    05_Work/          # In-progress, shaped content: writing, research, code
    06_Deliver/       # Final outputs, completed and shipped
    07_Learn/         # Reflections, retrospectives, journals, lessons
    08_Library/       # Evergreen notes: timeless concepts, methods, models
    98_Archive/       # Cold storage: done, deprecated, inactive
    

* * *

## 🗂 00_System/ -- _"Vault Infrastructure"_

**Purpose:** Everything needed to operate the system--but never actual content.

| Subfolder | Contents | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `Templates/` | Note, project, journal, review, meeting templates | 
| `Snippets/` | Code (CSS, shell, JS, regex), keyboard macros | 
| `Media/` | Icons, headers, SVGs used across notes | 
| `Logs/` | Sync scripts, audits, changelogs | 

**Rules:**

- Never add content notes here.
- Everything in here should be automatable, reusable, or replaceable.
* * *

## 🗂 01_Capture/ -- _"Just Caught This"_

**Purpose:** Inbox for all raw, unprocessed, unclassified notes.  
**Stay duration:** Minutes to 24 hours max.

| Subfolder | Use | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `Quick_Notes/` | Jotted ideas, fleeting thoughts | 
| `Web_Clips/` | Clipped articles or fragments | 
| `Voice_Memos/` | Transcripts or recorded ideas | 
| `Inbox_Files/` | Dropped-in PDFs, images, documents | 

**Rules:**

- Don't organize or edit yet.
- Run daily triage (see next folder).
* * *

## 🗂 02_Triage/ -- _"What Is This?"_

**Purpose:** Make decisions. Classify and route each captured item.

| Subfolder | Use | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `Do_Now/` | Takes <2 min to act--complete directly | 
| `Defer/` | Requires scheduling, later handling | 
| `Delegate/` | Assigned to others | 
| `Reference_Candidate/` | Might become evergreen | 
| `Delete_Review/` | Likely trash, delete after 7 days unless recovered | 

**Rules:**

- Process daily or every other day.
- Every note must exit this folder--it's a waiting room, not storage.
* * *

## 🗂 03_Nurture/ -- _"Not Yet, But Worth Saving"_

**Purpose:** Uncommitted ideas with promise.  
**Stay duration:** Weeks or months--reviewed weekly.

| Subfolder | Use | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `Someday_Maybe/` | Aspirational ideas | 
| `Backlog_Personal/` | Unscheduled, personal future actions | 
| `Backlog_Work/` | Same, but work-related | 
| `Waiting_On/` | Blocked on someone/something else | 

**Rules:**

- Only include notes with _potential future action_.
- Review weekly; promote to Plan or delete.
* * *

## 🗂 04_Plan/ -- _"Committed"_

**Purpose:** Notes for projects and tasks you've actively committed to.

| Subfolder | Use | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `Projects/` | One folder per project (e.g. `P2025-001-ShortSlug`) | 
| `Tasks_Next/` | Upcoming atomic actions | 
| `Tasks_Scheduled/` | On calendar, linked with due dates | 
| `Milestones/` | High-level goals tied to projects | 

**Rules:**

- Every item here should have an intended _outcome_.
- Projects must be scoped and reviewed weekly.
* * *

## 🗂 05_Work/ -- _"Shaping Content"_

**Purpose:** Where real work happens -- drafts, research, prototypes.

| Subfolder | Use | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `Drafting/` | Writing, slides, outlines | 
| `Research/` | Literature notes, experiments, data | 
| `Prototyping/` | Code, workflows, mockups | 

**Rules:**

- This is the "workbench." Content lives here until it's deliverable.
- Clean up regularly after delivery.
* * *

## 🗂 06_Deliver/ -- _"It's Done"_

**Purpose:** Final output that has been handed off, published, or finished.

| Subfolder | Use | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `Reports/` | Internal or client-facing write-ups | 
| `Articles/` | Published pieces | 
| `Presentations/` | Slide decks | 
| `Releases/` | Software, datasets | 
| `Assets_Final/` | Branded images, PDFs, exports | 

**Rules:**

- Notes move here only when they meet "Definition of Done."
- Output = outcome. Think finished, not "almost ready."
* * *

## 🗂 07_Learn/ -- _"What Did I Learn?"_

**Purpose:** Personal insight notes: reflection, journaling, review.

| Subfolder | Use | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `Journal_Daily/` | Daily entries (`YYYY/MM/DD.md`) | 
| `Weekly_Review/` | Weekly reflection notes | 
| `Monthly_Review/` | Monthly summaries | 
| `Retrospectives/` | Project-specific postmortems | 
| `Lessons_Learned/` | Distilled from experience | 

**Rules:**

- Not everything needs to be profound -- just consistent.
- Some entries may eventually promote to the Library.
* * *

## 🗂 08_Library/ -- _"Evergreen Knowledge"_

**Purpose:** Timeless, reusable information.  
Notes here are **refined and broadly applicable**.

| Subfolder | Use | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `Concepts/` | Named ideas, theories | 
| `Principles/` | Reusable truths or heuristics | 
| `Methods/` | Techniques and how-to patterns | 
| `Patterns/` | Repeating structural solutions | 
| `Cheatsheets/` | Reference lookup notes | 
| `Case_Studies/` | Real-world worked examples | 
| `Glossary/` | Terms and definitions | 
| `Resources/` | Book notes, links, papers, etc. | 

**Rules:**

- Every note must include a summary and clean metadata.
- Use for notes that survive beyond their project origin.
* * *

## 🗂 98_Archive/ -- _"Inactive but Kept"_

**Purpose:** Store anything no longer active, but worth keeping.

| Subfolder | Use | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `Projects_Completed/` | Archived from `04_Plan` or `05_Work` | 
| `Notes_Archived/` | Misc notes no longer relevant | 
| `Assets_Archived/` | Old images, media | 
| `Old_Reviews/` | Obsolete journals or retros | 

**Rules:**

- Archive only _finished or abandoned_ items.
- Anything over 12 months inactive with no future action belongs here.
* * *

## 🔁 Lifecycle Transitions

| From → To | Trigger | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `01_Capture/` → `02_Triage/` | Daily processing | 
| `02_Triage/` → `03_Nurture/` | Deferred, but not yet actionable | 
| `03_Nurture/` → `04_Plan/` | Weekly planning -- commit to act | 
| `04_Plan/` → `05_Work/` | Start shaping content | 
| `05_Work/` → `06_Deliver/` | Output is "done" and ready | 
| `06_Deliver/` → `07_Learn/` | Reflect after delivery | 
| `07_Learn/` → `08_Library/` | Insights worth remembering forever | 
| Any stage → `98_Archive/` | Obsolete, cold, or >1 year untouched | 

* * *

## 🧼 Maintenance Schedule

| Frequency | Task | Folder | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Daily | Triage `01_Capture/` | Move or delete | 
| Weekly | Review `03_Nurture/` | Promote or clean | 
| Weekly | Review `04_Plan/Projects/` | Check project health | 
| Biweekly | Prune `05_Work/` | Archive stale drafts | 
| Monthly | Audit `08_Library/` | Flag missing summaries or parents | 
| Quarterly | Prune `98_Archive/` | Compress/archive further | 

* * *

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements

### 📂 Naming Conventions

| Use | Format | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Projects | `PYYYY-NNN-ShortSlug` (e.g., `P2025-001-DeepWork`) | 
| Notes | `YYYYMMDDHHmmss.md` -- matches `uid` in metadata | 
| Journal | `YYYY/MM/DD.md` under `07_Learn/Journal_Daily/` | 

### ⚙ Git Hooks / Automation

- Auto-update `life.stage` field based on folder
- Auto-insert `updated`, `rev`, `words`
- Validate metadata completeness (lint)
- Nightly orphan check for Library notes (no `link.broader`)

| Purposeful subfolders | Each has one job, nothing ambiguous | 
| Lightweight hierarchy | No deep nesting; depth = clarity |
