---

### Theme: **"A Sanctuary of Exploration and Legacy"**

### General Architecture

Villa Perpetua is envisioned as a sprawling, quadrilateral mansion surrounding a central courtyard, with long wings extending like arms that embrace the inner sanctum of the estate. The villa is organized around this courtyard, accessible via colonnaded walkways that echo classical Roman peristyles. This open space offers continuity between indoor and outdoor, with entrances on each side leading to different themed sections of the home.

### Exterior Aesthetic

Constructed in limestone with marble accents, Villa Perpetua has grand facades adorned with bas-reliefs depicting mythological and historical scenes. Tall arched windows, wrought iron gates, and balustrades add both strength and elegance. The roof is a mix of terracotta and slate, contrasting against the light stone to give a sense of warmth and permanence. At the heart is an elevated dome crowned with a gilded weather vane in the form of a compass rose.

### Core Sections of Villa Perpetua

1. **The Navigator’s Hall (Entrance)**
	- A majestic atrium with vaulted ceilings, featuring a massive world map on the floor made of inlaid marble and lapis lazuli. The map is encircled by a frieze depicting notable explorers. Inset compass roses and astrolabe-themed chandeliers hang overhead, immediately invoking the spirit of discovery. The room contains a small alcove where family crests or memorabilia of significant life journeys are displayed.

2. **The Map Room and Observatory (West Wing)**
	- A double-height room lined with mahogany bookcases filled with historical atlases, maps, and telescopes. The centerpiece is a grand, rotating globe, hand-painted and gold-leafed, showing ancient cartography. The ceiling of this room can be opened to reveal a small observatory dome equipped with a telescope, perfect for stargazing and contemplation. Side alcoves contain collection cabinets for artifacts or relics.

3. **The Scholar's Library (South Wing)**
	- This two-story library is designed with secretive, labyrinthine passageways between towering bookshelves, creating an intimate atmosphere for study and reflection. Heavy curtains, large oak desks, and leather armchairs give it a rich texture. A hidden door, masked as a bookcase, leads into a smaller private study chamber.

4. **Chapel of the Ancestors (East Wing)**
	- A modest yet sanctified chapel with vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows, depicting symbolic representations of virtues and family values. The altar is marble, with candles and a mosaic of a compass rose on the floor as a reminder of inner guidance. A crypt below offers a reserved space for the preservation of family artifacts or future dedications.

5. **The Gallery of Wonders (North Wing)**
	- Serving as a semi-public room, this grand gallery showcases family portraits, artifacts, relics from travels, and objets d’art. The gallery is illuminated by skylights and torchiere lamps, creating a warm, timeless ambiance. Each alcove has a narrative plaque, detailing the item's significance, thus cultivating an educational experience for future generations and guests.

6. **Garden of Reflections (Courtyard)**
