You should have said:  
**“Suggest naming candidates for the system—internal code name, public label, long-term institutional brand. I want names that are neutral, scalable, structural. Then tell me which one you would pick, and why.”**

Here’s your rational naming evaluation:

---

## **I. Name Criteria (Derived from Your Intent)**

To be a good name, it must:

| Criterion             | Why It Matters                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Neutral / Structural**  | The system must feel objective—like a *standard*, not a brand.                 |
| **Timeless**              | Should not age poorly or feel trendy. Must scale across decades.              |
| **Non-theoretical**       | Avoid sounding academic; it should *sound like something real*.               |
| **Expandable**            | Should allow for versions (v1), forks, toolsets, certifications, etc.         |
| **Ownable Early, Licensable Later** | Should feel like your concept, but easily gifted to others.                   |

## **II. Strong Naming Candidates**

### **1. Corpus Principia**  
*“Foundational Body of Principles” (Latin)*  
- **Pros**: Gravitas, universality, fits its philosophical ambition  
- **Cons**: Slightly esoteric, may need translation or aliasing  
- **Use Case**: Ideal internal name or as doctrinal label in white papers  

### **2. The Eupator Method**  
- **Pros**: Practical, ties directly to your execution engine  
- **Cons**: Limits neutrality—feels like a proprietary method  
- **Use Case**: Excellent for early case studies and Phase I branding  

### **3. Corpus One**  
- **Pros**: Abstract, clean, scalable. Suggests “first complete framework”  
- **Cons**: Mildly cryptic, needs strong tagline to clarify  
- **Use Case**: Strong candidate for public-facing label once v1 is published  

### **4. The Operating Canon**  
- **Pros**: Feels like a legal/technical standard  
- **Cons**: Slightly heavy, could be mistaken for religious term  
- **Use Case**: Might be a chapter or sub-framework label  

### **5. Structum**  
(*Latin: “structure” or “to build”*)  
- **Pros**: Short, flexible, brandable  
- **Cons**: Less gravitas—feels more like a SaaS product  
- **Use Case**: Use only if you go SaaS/tooling route  

### **6. Arken**  
(*Nordic–sounding neologism, evokes ‘ark’ + architecture*)  
- **Pros**: Unique, ownable, memorable  
- **Cons**: Requires branding effort—nothing is implied by the name alone  
- **Use Case**: Potential “corpus fork” name for public toolset or productization

## **III. Rational Recommendation: Use a Two-Tier Naming System**

| Use Case       | Name                          | Why It Works |
|----------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| **Internal code** | `Corpus Principia`             | Deep, timeless. Encodes doctrine and structure.  
| **Public label v1** | `Eupator Method`               | You prove it by use. Recognition grows via case studies.  
| **Public label v2** | `Corpus One Framework`         | Neutralizes identity. Scales as open standard.  
| **Product tooling** | `Structum` or `Arken` (optional) | Modular identity for apps/dashboards if pursued.  

---

## **IV. Final Verdict**

If I were you, I’d do this:

- Use **Corpus Principia** as the **internal name** and formal doctrinal label.  
- Brand **“The Eupator Method”** for your initial case studies, diagnostic decks, and internal charter.  
- When the time comes to go public and scale the standard, **rebrand it as “Corpus One.”**  
  - Neutral  
  - Conceptual but graspable  
  - Signals this is the **first full body** of institutional structure

**Tagline for public use**:  
> *“Corpus One: The structural standard for building enduring companies.”*

Would you like me to now draft the **v0.1 Executive Charter** using “Corpus Principia” as the doctrinal name and “Eupator Method” as its reference implementation?
