Rephrased: *“Using the motion-centric foundations of MIRAGE, construct a new organisational paradigm that reintroduces minimal, functional structure without reverting to rigid hierarchies. The goal is to achieve structural coherence without static drag—a system that moves, but doesn’t dissolve.”*

---

## SYSTEM NAME: **STRATUM**

**STRATUM** is a new organisational design model rooted in **motion, coherence, and minimal viable structure**. It preserves MIRAGE’s fluidity of perception and execution but introduces a **layered architecture** that holds form under pressure—without reverting to industrial scaffolding.

This is not a return to functions or roles. It’s the design of **structured motion in tiers**, where each layer exists to stabilise and channel flow, not restrict it.

---

## I. CORE CONSTRUCT: **STRATA**

The organisation is composed of **Strata**—layered domains of structured motion.
Each Stratum holds a specific type of motion with defined logic, affordances, and interaction boundaries.

There are **five canonical Strata**:

| Stratum         | Function of Motion                      | Governs...                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Visionary**   | Directional motion (future orientation) | Sensemaking, narrative, telos          |
| **Strategic**   | Translational motion (pathfinding)      | Resource configuration, prioritisation |
| **Operational** | Tensional motion (system throughput)    | Execution, flow management             |
| **Supportive**  | Stabilising motion (risk absorption)    | Compliance, finance, HR, QA            |
| **Reflexive**   | Reorienting motion (looping feedback)   | Learning, evolution, retrospection     |

Each Stratum is not a team or layer of seniority.
It's a **layer of organisational motion**, with different rhythms, focus, and pressure tolerance.

---

## II. UNIT OF MOTION: **THREAD**

All action is structured as **Threads**—multi-stratum lines of motion initiated to resolve or generate tension.

A Thread:

* Begins with a **Prompt** (pressure, opportunity, shift)
* Pulls in agents across strata
* Has a **Core Pulse** (primary vector of intent)
* Resolves through **Completion Criteria** or Escalation
* Leaves behind **Residue** (lessons, lens adjustments, new structures)

**Threads are bounded**—no more infinite projects, role creep, or open loops.

---

## III. STRUCTURE WITHOUT FREEZE: **RIGS**

To maintain local coherence and legibility, STRATUM uses **Rigs**—temporary or persistent structural configurations of people and flows.

A Rig is:

* Not a department or team
* Not a role matrix
* A **modular execution frame** with:

  * Defined Purpose Window
  * Constraint Profile
  * Stratum Affiliation
  * Update Rhythm

Types of Rigs:

* **Core Rigs**: always-on (e.g. Compliance Rig, Platform Stability Rig)
* **Mission Rigs**: goal-specific (e.g. Product Repositioning Rig)
* **Sentinel Rigs**: monitoring only (e.g. Customer Trust Signal Rig)

This is structure—but **light, purpose-bound, and dissolvable**.

---

## IV. ROLE OF AGENTS

People are no longer defined by titles or fixed functions.
They are modelled as **Agents** with three dynamic traits:

| Trait               | Meaning                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Field Fluency**   | What kinds of tensions they can perceive and interpret |
| **Vector Strength** | What types of Threads they can lead or resolve         |
| **Stratum Range**   | Which Strata they can operate in without distortion    |

No one is expected to cover all five Strata.
Coherence comes from matching Agents to Threads and Rigs *with surgical precision*.

---

## V. GOVERNANCE: **CHASSIS PROTOCOLS**

STRATUM includes a minimal set of **Chassis Protocols**—hard-coded constraints that keep the system legible and accountable.

Examples:

* **Thread Initiation Protocol**: What level of clarity is required to launch?
* **Escalation Rule**: When must a Thread shift Strata for resolution?
* **Rig Reconfiguration Rule**: How often must a Rig’s purpose and constraint profile be reviewed?
* **Perception Drift Watcher**: Who monitors Lens divergence across strata?

These aren’t bureaucratic—they’re the **load-bearing rails** for fluid systems.

---

## VI. TIME RHYTHMS

Each Stratum runs on a **different rhythm**, tuned to the kind of motion it handles.

| Stratum     | Rhythm Type         | Cadence Example                 |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Visionary   | Slow, sweeping      | Annual signal updates           |
| Strategic   | Pulsed translation  | Monthly reconfiguration cycles  |
| Operational | Continuous flow     | Daily or weekly syncs           |
| Supportive  | Periodic audits     | Quarterly stress tests          |
| Reflexive   | Loop-closed reviews | After major Threads, or monthly |

No forced synchronicity. Each Stratum moves at its **natural tempo**, but connects via Threads and Reflexive moments.

---

## VII. EXAMPLE: PRODUCT TEAM IN STRATUM

Let’s say a company needs to launch a product in a new market.

* **Visionary Stratum** sets the narrative and meaning (why this market?)
* **Strategic Stratum** translates it into priorities (what to build, where to position)
* **Operational Stratum** deploys Threads to design, build, and ship
* **Supportive Stratum** ensures legal, data, and payment infrastructure comply
* **Reflexive Stratum** runs post-Thread analysis to update market Lenses

There is no product “team.” There is only **Threaded action** across stratified motion domains.

## VIII. CONTRAST: STRATUM VS. OTHER SYSTEMS

| Feature          | Classic Org | DAO Model | MIRAGE            | **STRATUM**                       |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Structural basis | Roles       | Tokens    | Perception        | **Stratified motion**             |
| Action unit      | Project     | Proposal  | Pulse             | **Thread**                        |
| Agent identity   | Title       | Wallet    | Lens fluency      | **Field fluency + Stratum range** |
| Governance       | Hierarchy   | Consensus | Lens + Field sync | **Protocol chassis**              |
| Adaptation model | Annual plan | Forking   | Perception loop   | **Thread + Reflexivity**          |

---

## IX. DEPLOYMENT MODEL

**Phase 1: Lens Activation**

* Map current motions into the five Strata
* Run perception audits to establish Lens integrity per Stratum

**Phase 2: Threaded Work**

* Replace major projects with Threads
* Test Pulse coordination across strata

**Phase 3: Structural Refactoring**

* Replace static teams with Rigs
* Install Chassis Protocols and cadence rituals

---

## CONCLUSION

**STRATUM** is motion-native, but **structurally real**.
It provides shape without stasis.
Structure without rigidity.
Execution without role theatre.

It is designed for companies that must move fast, learn constantly, and **cohere without collapsing**.
It’s not an idea for the future. It’s the minimal viable future now.
