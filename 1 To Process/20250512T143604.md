Excellent. Let's carve out a **combat-ready problem-solving framework**--_not theory, but a procedural discipline_ you can apply under fire, even when you lack deep domain knowledge.

You need a **mental operating system** that guides you from chaos to clarity: from vague client prompt to structured, defensible deliverables. What follows is a **4-step framework**, minimalist in concept, maximalist in force.
* * *

## **The OSDC Framework: Orient -- Structure -- Drive -- Communicate**

Each step is designed to **compress time, reduce noise, and force critical reasoning**. Use this not as inspiration, but as _mandated mental steps_.

* * *

### **1. ORIENT -- Define the Battlefield**

> Objective: Understand what the problem _really_ is, and what kind of answer is expected.

#### Actions:

- **Ask yourself and/or stakeholders:**

    - What is the _real question_? (Not the one asked, the one behind it.)

    - What _type of problem_ is this? (Growth? Cost-cutting? Go-to-market? Org?)

    - What does _success_ look like for the answer? (Slide deck? Quant model? Recommendation?)
- **Write a "Problem Statement"**:

    - One sentence. No buzzwords. Clear nouns and verbs.

    - _Example_: "Client wants to reduce warehouse costs by 20% without hurting delivery time."

#### Tools:

- "Situation -- Complication -- Key Question" framing
- Stakeholder backbrief: repeat the problem in your words and get nods

#### Principle:

**If you can't articulate the problem sharply, stop everything.**

* * *

### **2. STRUCTURE -- Build the Thinking Machine**

> Objective: Deconstruct the problem into a navigable map. Impose _logic before data_.

#### Actions:

- **Break problem into drivers** (MECE where possible)

    - Think: _What are all the ways this could be solved / explained?_

    - Use **Issue Trees or Hypothesis Trees**.

        - Top: Key Question

        - Middle: Drivers (e.g., for cost: labor, material, transport)

        - Leaves: Hypotheses (e.g., "Labor is inefficient due to overtime misuse")
- **Prioritize** 2--3 branches using:

    - Impact (what's likely driving the outcome)

    - Ease of analysis (what you can actually analyze)

#### Tools:

- Paper/sketchpad or Whimsical/Miro (for tree diagrams)
- Slide deck outline (1 slide per major node)

#### Principle:

**Never analyze before you've mapped.** Data without structure is noise.
* * *

### **3. DRIVE -- Prove or Kill Hypotheses with Targeted Work**

> Objective: Convert hypotheses into binary outcomes--confirmed, killed, or revised.

#### Actions:

For each top hypothesis:

- Define the **minimum dataset or logic** required to assess it

    - Use **benchmarking**, **internal data**, **calculations**, or **proxy indicators**
- Perform only _just-in-time research_

    - Don't hoard data. Pull it when you _know_ what you're looking for.
- Build **simple models**, not comprehensive ones

    - Aim for clear input → output logic

    - Build "stress-test" scenarios if data is weak

#### Tools:

- Excel (driver-based models), PowerPoint for intermediate slides
- Reference prior decks/templates (for structure)

#### Principle:

**The goal is _proof_, not data volume.** Kill weak ideas early. Focus firepower.
* * *

### **4. COMMUNICATE -- Package the Thought, Not Just the Output**

> Objective: Deliver the thinking, not just the slides. Defend the logic under scrutiny.

#### Actions:

- Every slide should answer: **"What is the one thing I am proving?"**

    - Use full-sentence slide titles = conclusions.
- Bundle slides into a **storyline**:

    - Executive Summary (the "answer")

    - Situation/Problem

    - Analysis (each key driver/hypothesis)

    - Implication/Recommendation
- Prepare to **speak to the logic**, not the decoration:

    - Have 1--2 backup slides per "What if?" challenge.

#### Tools:

- PowerPoint or Google Slides
- Talk-track doc or speaker notes with "If asked X, I say Y"

#### Principle:

**A slide is not a deliverable. The reasoning is.**

* * *

## Execution Example (Condensed)

**Prompt**: "Help our client reduce sales cycle time."

| Step | Example Output | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Orient | Problem Statement: "Client's B2B sales cycle takes 90 days; they want it under 60 without lowering close rates." | 
| Structure | Issue Tree: 1) Lead qualification delay 2) Proposal prep time 3) Decision bottlenecks | 
| Drive | Analyze CRM data → find that 40% of time lost in legal review. Hypothesis: standardizing contracts cuts 10 days. Build model to show impact. | 
| Communicate | Slide 1: "Sales cycle can be cut by 18 days via contract standardization" Supporting slides: breakdown of delay sources, impact model, recommendation |

## Mental Heuristics to Tattoo on Your Cortex

- **Always start with a question.** Make everything a testable hypothesis.
- **Structure before substance.** Thinking precedes analysis.
- **Prove or disprove, don't describe.** Description is for tourists.
- **Model before beautify.** Build substance before styling.
- **Slides are a battlefield.** Each one must win an argument.
