**Correction**: The more precise inquiry is: _"Assess whether the core of the Reality Wrapper should be purely descriptive--i.e., an ontological model of reality independent of implementation--and whether derived schemes or tools should exist as optional, layered interpretations on top of that base."_

* * *

### Assessment: **Should RW Be Descriptive at Its Core?**

**Conclusion:**  
Yes. The Reality Wrapper's foundational function should be purely **descriptive**, not prescriptive. Its purpose is not to encode how systems _should_ behave or be implemented, but to enable _any existing structure--logical, physical, behavioural--to be abstracted, represented, and reasoned about_ in a unified schema.

It is a **meta-ontology**, not a methodology.

## 1. **Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Role Clarity**

| Characteristic | Descriptive RW Core | Prescriptive RW Tooling | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Purpose** | Capture the structure of reality | Suggest optimal structures, workflows | 
| **Scope** | Infinite, unconstrained | Bounded to specific use-cases | 
| **Value Proposition** | Semantic coherence across systems | Execution efficiency, standardisation | 
| **Change Rate** | Very low | Evolves with domain needs | 
| **Authority** | Ontological | Operational | 

**Verdict**: The descriptive core is the stable substrate. Prescriptive layers are optional, functional overlays.

* * *

## 2. **Implications of a Descriptive Core**

### a. **Neutrality**

RW cannot encode preference, process, or optimization logic in its core without becoming opinionated and brittle. A purely descriptive model ensures:

- **Domain-agnosticism**: It can model folder trees, geopolitical systems, or neuronal maps equally.
- **Timelessness**: It doesn't collapse when tech stacks or management trends change.
- **Extensibility**: New domains can be added without changing the base.

### b. **Expressive Power**

To capture all possible systems, RW must only define:

- **What exists** (entities)
- **How things relate** (relations)
- **What can occur** (processes)
- **Under what condition** (frames)
- **What changes what** (operators)

These are ontological _axioms_, not engineering _constraints_. The system only demands semantic clarity, not execution behavior.

* * *

## 3. **Layering Prescriptive Schemes on Top**

Yes, what I previously split as **Spec vs. Lang** was implicitly doing this: separating **core descriptive ontology** from **language, tools, and operational schemes** built on top.

Here's a formalised stack model:

### RW Stack: Clean Separation of Layers

| Layer | Type | Function | Governed by | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **RW Core (Descriptive Model)** | Ontology | What exists, how it's structured | Immutable, minimal | 
| **RW Schema Layer** | DSL/Metamodels | Domain-specific logics (e.g., project.mgmt.rws) | Versioned modules | 
| **RW Language** | Serialisation Grammar | How to _write_ the model | Optional per use-case | 
| **RW Tooling** | SDK, Parsers, Visualisers | How to _interact_ with it | Evolvable, swappable | 
| **RW Methodologies** | Ops Playbooks | How to _apply_ it in practice | Fully user-defined | 

This enforces a strict **gravity model**:  
Nothing above can redefine what's below. The RW Core is the center of mass; everything else orbits it.

* * *

## 4. **Implementation Flexibility: Design Constraints**

| Constraint | Rationale | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **No mandatory execution logic in core** | Keeps RW pure and descriptive | 
| **No predefined domains** | Domain frames must be plug-ins, not hardcoded | 
| **Frames must be declared, not assumed** | Prevents invisible structure drift | 
| **Ontology versioning must be strict** | Enables composability across time and teams | 

If adhered to, RW can describe:

- An arbitrary file system (`Folder ⊃ Folder | File`)
- A regulatory model (`Actor ⟶ is_subject_to ⟶ Law`)
- A conversation (`Agent ⟶ emits ⟶ Signal`)
- A mechanical system (`Component ⟶ transfers_energy_to ⟶ Component`)

Without ever prescribing how these things should behave--only how they are logically and relationally constructed.

* * *

## 5. **Critical Risks If RW Becomes Prescriptive**

| Risk | Consequence | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Tool-dependence** | RW collapses into another proprietary system | 
| **Overfitting** | Domains start distorting the model to match tools | 
| **Loss of generality** | RW no longer serves as a cross-domain bridge | 
| **Version churn** | Stable structures become unstable due to external trends | 

All of these violate the intent of RW as a **reality mirror**, not a process designer.

* * *

## Final Judgement

Yes, RW must remain fundamentally **descriptive**--a neutral, minimal, structurally complete **map of reality as-structured**, not as-interpreted, not as-optimised.

Derived frameworks, execution systems, and workflows are all **valid overlays**, not core features.

Maintain this separation ruthlessly. The elegance, durability, and universality of RW depend on it.
