Congrats on diving into the rabbit-hole!  Choosing a “daily driver” ink is mostly about matching where, on what, and for whom you write.  Here are a few lenses you can use to decide, with some tried-and-true picks in each category:

What you need most	Why it matters	Reliable go-to colours & examples
Professional credibility	Many workplaces still frown on flamboyant hues.  An ink that scans as conservative but still shows character is ideal.	Blue-black: Sailor Sei-boku (waterproof & subtly sheening); Diamine Oxford Blue (classic, well-behaved). Rich black: Aurora Black (deep, lubricated), Pilot Black (won’t clog even in dry pens).
Archival permanence	Journals, signatures, or notes that must survive spills and decades.	Iron-gall blue-black: Rohrer & Klingner Salix (gentle IG formula). Pigment black: Platinum Carbon Black (extremely waterproof—clean pen monthly).
Readability + personality	If you jot long pages of notes, you want contrast and low eye-fatigue, but maybe a hint of flair.	Muted teal/blue-green: Pilot Iroshizuku Syo-ro, Sailor Yama-dori (shades from deep teal to red sheen). Warm brown: Diamine Chocolate or Montblanc Toffee Brown (easy on the eyes).
Lots of highlighting/ scanning	Some colours photocopy badly; blue-black usually scans crisply.	Any well-saturated blue-black or neutral black.
Fun but still polite	You journal at cafés, sign postcards, or annotate novels—nothing legal, but you don’t want neon.	Dusky purple: Diamine Earl Grey (actually a grey-lavender) or Sailor Shikiori Rikyu-cha (olive brown).

A quick decision tree
	1.	Need office-safe or legal-safe?
→ Start with a blue-black (more personality than plain black but still formal).
	2.	Writing mostly at home or in classes?
→ Choose a dark teal, burgundy, or brown that makes you smile when you open your notebook.
	3.	Archival concerns (journals, art)?
→ Lean toward an iron-gall blue-black or a well-behaved pigment black.
	4.	Love shading and sheen?
→ Go for a saturated teal/blue-green (e.g., Sailor Yama-dori) or a dusky purple; they show dramatic colour variation without screaming.

Two minimalist starter strategies
	•	“One-ink-to-rule-them-all” approach:
Pick a forgiving, bottle-easy ink like Diamine Oxford Blue. It behaves on cheap copy paper, cleans out easily, doesn’t feather, and is accepted almost everywhere.
	•	“Core plus spice” approach:
Keep one cartridge/converter filled with a workhorse blue-black for everyday, and a second pen (or spare converter) with a mood ink—say, a smoky teal or warm sepia—for headings, call-outs, or weekend journaling.

What’s your typical writing setting—office notes, lecture scribbles, personal letters, sketching, or a mix?  And do you care more about water resistance or about eye-catching shading?  Tell me a bit about that, and I can narrow the list to a couple of perfect bottles for you.
