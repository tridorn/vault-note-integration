Alright — here’s where we go from “impressive collector” to “fountain pen secret society member.”
These wildcards lean into rarity, artisan craft, and collector cult-status.

⸻

Wildcard Recommendations

1. Nakaya Cigar (Arai-shu Tamenuri) – Soft Medium
	•	Why: Hand-turned ebonite, urushi lacquer layers that glow with depth over time. Each Nakaya is made by former Platinum craftsmen and tuned to order.
	•	Ink pairing: Pilot Iroshizuku Fuyu-gaki — the vibrant orange plays against the warm reddish-brown lacquer beautifully.
	•	Collector signal: Anyone who knows urushi will instantly understand you’ve gone deep down the rabbit hole.

⸻

2. Aurora Optima – Auroloide Blue with Gold Trim, Fine
	•	Why: Italian-made piston filler with Aurora’s in-house nib and distinctive toothy feedback. The blue auroloide material is mesmerizing.
	•	Ink pairing: Montblanc Blue Hour Twilight — subtle yet rich shading, complements the celluloid-like swirls.
	•	Collector signal: Aurora is one of the few still making their nibs entirely in-house in Italy — a mark of seriousness.

⸻

3. Franklin-Christoph Model 66 Stabilis – Antique Glass with SIG Stub
	•	Why: Minimalist desk pen made in acrylic that mimics frosted glass, long section perfect for unposted use. The SIG (Stub Italic Gradient) nib is hand-ground for natural line variation.
	•	Ink pairing: KWZ Honey — warm shading browns that glow in the translucent barrel.
	•	Collector signal: Franklin-Christoph is a cult US maker — the 66 Stabilis is loved by serious nib geeks and Instagram ink photographers.

⸻

4. Montblanc 149 Calligraphy Flex – Soft Flexible Nib
	•	Why: The modern 149 with true flex. This is Montblanc’s answer to vintage flex demand, capable of expressive copperplate and bold swells.
	•	Ink pairing: Montblanc Swan Illusion Plume — a soft shading taupe that matches the refined flex aesthetic.
	•	Collector signal: Montblanc flex nibs are limited and very few make it into everyday writing rotations.

⸻

5. Conid Regular Bulkfiller – Polished Titanium with Fine Nib (if you can find one)
	•	Why: Belgian engineering marvel with massive ink capacity and a unique bulkfilling mechanism. Precision-machined titanium feels like something out of a watchmaker’s workshop.
	•	Ink pairing: Sailor Souten — bright, clear blue that shows off in the huge ink window.
	•	Collector signal: Conid closed public orders in 2022 — any Conid now is instant collector street cred.

If you combine your Pilot Falcon + my main lineup + two or three of these wildcards, you’ll have a cohesive, world-class starter collection that feels intentional — not just “a bunch of expensive pens.”

I can also sketch you a display/rotation strategy so that each pen/ink pairing is used in a way that maximizes both writing pleasure and ink performance. That would make your collection feel curated like a watch collector’s weekly rotation.

Do you want me to build that rotation plan?
