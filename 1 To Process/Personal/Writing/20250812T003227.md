Got it ‚Äî you‚Äôve started with the Pilot Falcon (soft nib, expressive line variation), which is a fantastic gateway into gold nibs and characterful writing.
If you‚Äôre building a collection for variety in both writing feel and ink capacity, I‚Äôd suggest deliberately covering different ‚Äúconstellations‚Äù of pen types: nib flex/firmness, filling mechanism, body material, and line width.

Here‚Äôs a progression that would give you maximum range without redundancy:

‚∏ª

1. Workhorse / High-Capacity Ink Tank
	‚Ä¢	TWSBI Vac700R ‚Äî Fine or Medium nib
	‚Ä¢	Why: Huge ink capacity (vacuum filler) for long writing sessions, transparent barrel to show off ink colors.
	‚Ä¢	Ink pairing idea: Sheening inks like Robert Oster Fire & Ice or Diamine Majestic Blue ‚Äî looks stunning in a demonstrator.
	‚Ä¢	Setup tip: Keep one filled with an everyday writer-friendly ink for long projects.

‚∏ª

2. Classic Piston Filler / German Precision
	‚Ä¢	Pelikan M600 ‚Äî Medium nib (Pelikan nibs run broad, so M ‚âà Japanese B)
	‚Ä¢	Why: Smooth piston action, gold nib with buttery glide, easy nib swapping.
	‚Ä¢	Ink pairing idea: Shading inks like Sailor Manyo Haha or Iroshizuku Yama-budo.
	‚Ä¢	Setup tip: The M600 size is a sweet spot ‚Äî balanced posted and unposted.

‚∏ª

3. Vintage-Style Softness / Modern Reliability
	‚Ä¢	Platinum #3776 Century ‚Äî Soft Fine or Soft Medium
	‚Ä¢	Why: Japanese soft gold nibs offer springy feedback (less flex than Falcon, but cushioned), excellent slip-and-seal cap.
	‚Ä¢	Ink pairing idea: Complex multi-tonal inks like Pilot Iroshizuku Tsuki-yo ‚Äî stays fresh for months.
	‚Ä¢	Setup tip: Perfect as your ‚Äúalways ready‚Äù pen.

‚∏ª

4. Heavy Metal Precision
	‚Ä¢	Pilot Custom 823 ‚Äî Broad nib
	‚Ä¢	Why: Vacuum filler, large ink reserve, incredibly smooth nib for bold signatures or journaling.
	‚Ä¢	Ink pairing idea: Saturated inks like Montblanc Irish Green or Sailor Jentle Black for luxurious wet lines.
	‚Ä¢	Setup tip: This one‚Äôs for when you want to feel important while signing things.

‚∏ª

5. Eyedropper Eccentric
	‚Ä¢	Opus 88 Demonstrator ‚Äî Fine or Medium
	‚Ä¢	Why: Massive ink chamber, shut-off valve for travel, designed for shimmering or experimental inks.
	‚Ä¢	Ink pairing idea: Diamine Shimmertastic series ‚Äî the pen‚Äôs feed handles particles well.
	‚Ä¢	Setup tip: Dedicated shimmer pen keeps your other pens safe from clogging.

‚∏ª

üí° Collection Logic:
	‚Ä¢	Flex/soft: Pilot Falcon (you already have this) & Platinum #3776 Soft nib
	‚Ä¢	Smooth gliders: Pelikan M600 & Pilot Custom 823
	‚Ä¢	Workhorse tanks: TWSBI Vac700R & Opus 88
	‚Ä¢	Covers: cartridge/converter, piston, vacuum, eyedropper systems
	‚Ä¢	Range: fine Japanese feedback ‚Üí German butter-smooth ‚Üí springy flex

If you want, I can also map you a ‚Äúrotation plan‚Äù where each pen has a dedicated ink mood so you can swap instantly without flushing pens all the time. That way, you always have a flex, a shimmer, a workhorse, a smooth signature pen, and a shading show-off ready.

Do you want me to give you that ink mood rotation plan next?
