Alright — so you’ve started with a Pilot Falcon (Fine), which means you already have an expressive, soft-nib pen in your lineup. You’ve set the tone for a refined, intentional, and collector-worthy curation rather than just “random pens I bought.”

If you want a tasteful, seasoned-collector-approved set, we’ll build your collection around variety in nib experience, filling mechanism, and design aesthetic, while also matching specific ink colours that suit each pen’s character.

Your Next Five Pens & Inks — A Cohesive Collection Plan

1. Lamy 2000 (EF or F) — Makrolon Black
	•	Why: A Bauhaus icon, the Lamy 2000 is sleek, minimalist, and timeless. It balances out the Falcon’s expressive flair with a pen designed for workhorse precision.
	•	Filling System: Piston filler (ink capacity +1 for convenience).
	•	Recommended Ink: Montblanc Permanent Blue-Black — understated, professional, archival.
	•	Aesthetic Role: Modernist anchor in your collection; subtle luxury for the trained eye.

⸻

2. Pelikan Souverän M600 — Green Striated
	•	Why: A classic in the German school of fountain pen design. Lighter and more agile than the M800, but still substantial.
	•	Nib Choice: M (smooth, generous Pelikan flow).
	•	Filling System: Piston filler, excellent ink capacity.
	•	Recommended Ink: Robert Oster Signature Green Gold — harmonizes with the striated green body while adding a subtle sheen.
	•	Aesthetic Role: Vintage-informed elegance; the green stripes are recognized instantly by aficionados.

3. Platinum #3776 Century — Bourgogne (Soft Fine)
	•	Why: Japanese precision with a touch of luxury; “Slip & Seal” cap means ink won’t dry out for months.
	•	Nib: SF (Soft Fine) for a gentle bounce — different feel from the Falcon’s SF, more controlled.
	•	Filling System: Cartridge/converter.
	•	Recommended Ink: Sailor Jentle Oku-Yama — a deep, wine-red with sheen that matches the pen body.
	•	Aesthetic Role: Rich color statement in an otherwise classic form.

⸻

4. Sailor Pro Gear Slim — Blue Lagoon or Storm Over the Ocean (Limited Edition)
	•	Why: Sailor nibs are crisp, precise, and have that tactile feedback Japanese nib lovers crave.
	•	Nib: MF (Medium Fine) to get that sweet spot between precision and smoothness.
	•	Filling System: Cartridge/converter.
	•	Recommended Ink: Sailor Jentle Shikiori Yonaga (deep blue-black with subtle complexity).
	•	Aesthetic Role: A dash of Japanese artisanal color sense; perfect for subtle ink-play.

⸻

5. Aurora Optima — Blue Auroloide with Gold Trim
	•	Why: Italian craftsmanship with a piston filler and unique, toothy nib feel — great for those who enjoy feedback without scratchiness.
	•	Nib: Fine.
	•	Recommended Ink: Aurora Blue — pure, vibrant, and perfectly matched to the pen’s heritage.
	•	Aesthetic Role: Mediterranean flair; deep resin chatoyance gives an heirloom quality.

Why This Lineup Works
	•	Variety in Feel: You’ll have soft, springy, smooth, precise, and toothy nib experiences.
	•	Variety in Fillers: Piston, cartridge/converter — so you balance capacity with convenience.
	•	Color Harmony: Neutral black/blue pens anchor the collection; green and red tones add character without becoming garish.
	•	Collector Credibility: Every pen here has deep heritage and is well-regarded among enthusiasts — no “fad” models.

If you want, I can map this set into a “collector’s spectrum” — showing how each pen’s role complements the others in nib flexibility, daily usability, and showcase factor — so you can be sure your lineup looks intentional, not random.

Do you want me to do that next?
