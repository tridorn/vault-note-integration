**Correction:** You should have said: _"Outline a strategy for continuous deployment of the Beryl AX as a personal, mobile router using cellular connectivity. Assess the prudence of a cellular approach, evaluate hardware dependencies like power banks, and structure a robust plan for always-on use."_
* * *

### **Strategic Objective**

Establish a **self-contained, mobile, and sovereign network node**, operational regardless of environment (public, hostile, disconnected) and independent from third-party infrastructure (coffee shop Wi-Fi, hotel routers, etc).

* * *

## I. **Feasibility Assessment: Is Cellular Prudent?**

**Yes--conditionally.**

Cellular connectivity enables:

- **Geographic independence:** Access anywhere there's coverage.
- **Reduced dependency:** No need for external Wi-Fi or untrusted infrastructure.
- **Tactical autonomy:** Control routing, DNS, and firewall even on the move.

**Risks and Trade-offs:**

- **Cost:** Mobile data plans are more expensive per GB.
- **Throughput volatility:** Subject to signal strength, tower congestion, and carrier throttling.
- **SIM restrictions:** Some providers block tethering or throttle non-handset devices.

**Conclusion:** A cellular strategy is prudent **if backed by the right modem, data plan, and power strategy.**
* * *

## II. **Hardware Stack Recommendation**

### A. **Router:**

- **GL.iNet Beryl AX (MT3000)**

    - Keep firmware current. Hardened as per previous advice.

### B. **Modem:**

- **Recommended USB Cellular Modems:**

    - **Quectel EP06-E** or **RM500Q (5G)** -- Industrial-grade, multi-region LTE/5G.

    - **Huawei E3372h-320** -- Consumer-grade LTE stick (avoid HiLink variants).
- Connect via USB. The router treats the modem as a WAN interface.

### C. **SIM Strategy:**

- **Data-only SIM with tethering allowed.**
- Prefer MVNOs that explicitly support modem usage.
- Consider **multi-country** or **global roaming SIMs** for cross-border operability (e.g. Ubigi, Airalo, or physical SIMs with fixed IP from carriers like Three UK, Telna).

### D. **Power Supply:**

- **Power Bank:** Minimum 10,000 mAh with 18W USB output.

    - Example: Anker PowerCore PD or equivalent.

    - Target run-time: ~6--8 hrs for router + modem combo.
- Optional: Solar panel + battery bank if off-grid for extended periods.
* * *

## III. **Deployment Configuration**

### A. **Routing Strategy:**

- Default WAN: Cellular modem (wwan0).
- Fallback: Wi-Fi repeater mode (trusted networks).
- DNS over TLS or DNSCrypt via local resolver.

### B. **Fail-Safes:**

- **Kill switch:** Block traffic if modem fails or VPN disconnects.
- **Auto-reconnect scripts:** Ensure WAN reconnect logic is bulletproof (use watchdogs or cron jobs).

### C. **Network Modes:**

- Primary: Routed AP with NAT and DHCP.
- Optional: Hidden SSID or MAC randomisation for stealth.
* * *

## IV. **Operational Profiles (Examples)**

| Profile | WAN Source | Use Case | Notes | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Urban Nomad** | Cellular (Modem) | Moving between cities/cafes | Always-on, minimal reliance on public Wi-Fi | 
| **Hotel Override** | Repeater | Replaces hotel Wi-Fi | Beryl bridges hotel captive portal once, then creates secure subnet | 
| **Off-Grid Comms** | Cellular (Modem) | Rural fieldwork | Paired with solar power if needed | 
| **Air Travel** | Offline + Tether | Use during layovers | Quick USB tether from phone to avoid airport Wi-Fi | 
* * *

## V. **Operational Security Considerations**

- No trust in upstream (ISP/carrier). All DNS, routing, and filtering enforced at router level.
- Rotate VPN exit nodes. Use multi-hop WireGuard if feasible.
- Rotate SIMs and avoid long-term IP tracking.
- Disable cloud management features (GL.iNet cloud, etc).
* * *

## VI. **Long-Term Scalability**

- Add SD card or USB storage for data caching, backups, or portable file serving.
- Integrate local Unbound DNS server for caching and latency reduction.
- Automate daily config backups to encrypted remote location (e.g., SFTP, scp over VPN).
* * *

## Final Verdict

A **cellular-based mobile router strategy using the Beryl AX is viable and strategically sound**--provided you invest in the correct modem, select compliant SIMs, and architect for power autonomy. The result is a resilient, private, transportable networking enclave. You're not just mobile--you're sovereign.
