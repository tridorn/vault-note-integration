Always excellent reviews and very follow up...., In relation to this particular ink, after much searching and testing, I have chosen the Diamine Oxford Blue, as the base ink for formal writing, as valid for home as for more formal environments. Other favorite colors, among the range of inks I have are : 

Black : Perle Noire 
Dark Blue : Diamine Oxford Blue 
Blue: Diamine Sargasso Sea 
Red: Diamine Red Dragon 
Green : Pelikan 4001 Dark Green 
Magenta : Lamy Crystal Beryl 
Turquoise : Pelikan 4001 Turquoise

Cheers and enjoy the writing.....
