# Different approach to new model

It would be more precise to ask: “Could you elucidate on expanding the in-the-moment check by incorporating additional Stoic principles for a deeper and more comprehensive application?”

To enhance the in-the-moment check (*prohairesis*) with a broader range of Stoic principles, you can integrate several additional considerations that allow for a more profound reflection and response. This expanded check can be structured to systematically address multiple layers of your cognitive and emotional landscape, leading to richer, more virtuous outcomes.

### **Expanded In-the-Moment Check (*Prohairesis* Enhanced)**

1. **Immediate Pause and Awareness**
   - **Practice**: Cultivate the habit of an immediate mental pause at the onset of any significant stimulus or decision-point. This involves a conscious effort to step back mentally before engaging with the situation.
   - **Stoic Principle**: The concept of *prosoche* (attention), which is the practice of maintaining continuous vigilance over one's thoughts and actions, ensuring they are always in alignment with Stoic virtues.

2. **Identification of Impressions**
   - **Practice**: Identify the initial impressions or *phantasiai* that arise in response to the situation. This includes emotional reactions, instinctive thoughts, and immediate judgments.
   - **Stoic Principle**: The discipline of assent, where one evaluates whether to accept or reject these initial impressions based on their accordance with reality and virtue.

3. **Dichotomy of Control Analysis**
   - **Practice**: Assess whether the elements of the situation fall within your control (internal) or beyond it (external). This helps to focus your response where it can actually be effective.
   - **Stoic Principle**: The core Stoic teaching of focusing only on what is within one’s control, thereby maintaining tranquility by not being perturbed by external uncontrollables.

4. **Alignment with Nature**
   - **Practice**: Reflect on how your potential responses align with the concept of living according to nature—both your own nature as a rational being and the nature of the universe as a rational, interconnected whole.
   - **Stoic Principle**: The Stoic goal of living in agreement with nature, which emphasizes understanding your role in the larger context and acting in a way that is congruent with your best, most rational self.

5. **Consultation of Virtues**
   - **Practice**: Deliberately consult the four cardinal Stoic virtues—wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance—to guide your response. This step involves asking how each virtue might manifest in the present situation.
   - **Stoic Principle**: The ethical framework of Stoicism, where virtues are the only true goods and the basis for all ethical action.

6. **Preemptive Reflection on Consequences**
   - **Practice**: Consider the potential short-term and long-term consequences of your actions. This involves thinking ahead to the possible outcomes of different responses and evaluating them based on their alignment with Stoic ethics.
   - **Stoic Principle**: The practice of *praemeditatio malorum*, where one anticipates challenges and potential adversities to better prepare oneself to face them with virtue.

7. **Decision to Act**
   - **Practice**: Make a conscious decision to act or not act based on the reflections conducted in the previous steps. This decision should be firm and aligned with your rational assessment of the best course of action.
   - **Stoic Principle**: The Stoic commitment to action that is reasoned, deliberate, and virtuous, reflective of one’s highest self.

8. **Mental Rehearsal**
   - **Practice**: Mentally rehearse the decided action, imagining yourself executing it in a manner that embodies Stoic virtues. This mental rehearsal can help solidify your resolve and clarify the practical steps of the action.
   - **Stoic Principle**: The exercise of visualization, which aids in mental preparation and strengthens one’s capacity to act virtuously under pressure.

9. **Feedback and Adjustment**
   - **Practice**: After acting, reflect on the outcome and your handling of the situation. Consider what was done well and what could be improved in future scenarios.
   - **Stoic Principle**: The Stoic practice of *examination of conscience* or reflective self-assessment, which is crucial for ongoing personal development and virtuous refinement.

### **Implementation in Daily Life**

To effectively implement this expanded *prohairesis* in your daily life, you might consider setting regular intervals to practice these reflections, perhaps through daily journaling or meditation sessions focused on these principles. Additionally, in moments of stress or decision-making, quickly run through this checklist mentally to guide your actions. Over time, these practices can become more automatic, deeply embedding Stoic principles into your everyday responses and decisions. This method not only enhances your ability to live according to Stoic virtues but also deepens your understanding and application of Stoicism as a comprehensive philosophy of life.
