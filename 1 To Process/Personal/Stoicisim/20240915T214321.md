# in-depth of in our control

A more suitable phrasing would be: "Could you delve more profoundly into the practical implications of what is within our control, especially with regard to how we may apply this understanding in our daily conduct?"

The Stoic doctrine regarding what is within our control centers primarily on the domain of our *prohairesis*—our capacity for moral reasoning and volition. In practice, this control manifests in specific areas that, though seemingly subtle, represent the entire scope of human freedom. Let us now explore each aspect more exhaustively, emphasizing how this delineation applies practically.

### 1. **Judgments (Dogmata)**

#### Stoic View:
Judgments are the interpretations and evaluations we make about events, people, and circumstances. Stoicism teaches that no external event in itself possesses intrinsic value (good or bad); it is our *judgment* that assigns such values.

#### Practical Implication:
In practice, this means that you possess full authority over how you *interpret* what happens to you. For instance, a colleague's criticism of your work is a neutral event. You have the power to judge it as either destructive (causing you frustration) or constructive (an opportunity for growth). Your emotional response is tied not to the event itself but to how you judge it.

Thus, cultivating rational and virtuous judgments becomes paramount. Regularly question your initial emotional reactions: "Is my response to this event based on a rational judgment, or am I allowing my passions to take over?" Through reflection and mindfulness, you can begin to train yourself to judge circumstances dispassionately and objectively.

A practical exercise might be the daily practice of *prosoche* (attentiveness), wherein you monitor your judgments in real-time, making sure that you are not jumping to conclusions or allowing irrational impulses to shape your perceptions.

### 2. **Desires and Aversions (Hormê and Echthra)**

#### Stoic View:
We naturally experience desires (to obtain something) and aversions (to avoid something). However, these must be carefully governed by reason. Stoicism teaches that we should only desire what is truly within our control—namely, virtuous action. Conversely, we should only be averse to moral failings, not external inconveniences like pain or loss.

#### Practical Implication:
In practical terms, the discipline of desires and aversions transforms how you approach both pleasure and adversity. You cannot control whether you will be promoted at work, whether your investments will yield returns, or whether you will encounter unexpected misfortune. What you can control is the desire to act virtuously within these circumstances and the aversion to behaving unjustly or irrationally.

For example, let us consider financial success. Instead of desiring wealth itself (which is subject to many external factors), the Stoic would desire to manage their resources wisely, fairly, and with moderation—actions that are fully within their control. Should financial difficulties arise, the Stoic refrains from aversion toward the hardship itself but remains averse only to acting dishonorably or losing self-control in the face of difficulty.

A way to apply this in practice is to realign your goals: whenever you set a goal, ask yourself, "Is this goal based on a desire for external success, or on a desire for virtuous action?" Redirect your desires toward internal factors—effort, integrity, wisdom—and reduce the emotional turbulence associated with external results.

### 3. **Actions and Choices (Prohairesis)**

#### Stoic View:
While external forces may shape the conditions under which we act, we retain full control over *how* we act within those conditions. This power of choice—*prohairesis*—is the heart of Stoic freedom. The moral quality of your life depends not on external events but on your capacity to choose your response to them.

#### Practical Implication:
In day-to-day life, this means taking full ownership of every decision, no matter how constrained you may feel by external circumstances. Even in the most limiting situations—such as loss, illness, or social injustice—you retain the capacity to choose actions that reflect your commitment to virtue.

For instance, if you are unfairly passed over for a promotion at work, you still control how you react: you can choose bitterness and resentment, or you can choose to continue working with integrity, perhaps even improving yourself in the process. The Stoic recognizes that external success or recognition is irrelevant to moral excellence; what matters is whether you respond with justice, courage, and temperance in every situation.

A concrete method of applying this is to implement a habit of immediate reflection before any action: “Am I choosing this action because it reflects my reason and virtue, or because of some external pressure or fear?”

### 4. **Assent to Impressions (Sunkatathesis)**

#### Stoic View:
When an impression or stimulus enters our awareness, we have the power to assent to it (accept it as true or valid) or reject it. This is a crucial point of control because initial impressions are often automatic and shaped by external stimuli, but the decision to accept or reject them is entirely within our control.

#### Practical Implication:
In practical terms, this means you are not at the mercy of your first emotional reaction or thought. If someone insults you, your immediate impression might be that you’ve been wronged, leading to anger. However, you control whether to assent to this impression or reject it by reminding yourself that insults are opinions of others and do not reflect your worth.

In practice, the Stoic trains themselves to question first impressions systematically. Before you allow an emotion to dominate your response, ask: “Is this impression aligned with reason? Does it reflect a truth, or is it merely a distortion?”

### Applying the Stoic Concept of Control in Daily Life

Now, considering these aspects, a Stoic approach to life is defined by the following practical actions:

1. **Embrace Radical Responsibility**: You must take full responsibility for everything within your control. Whether or not a particular external goal is achieved, you retain full responsibility for the virtue with which you pursue it. Failure in external endeavors does not reflect failure in life; rather, failure in virtue is the only true defeat.

2. **Regular Self-Examination**: The Stoics often engaged in *epilogismos*, a form of daily self-examination. Each evening, reflect on your day: Did you maintain control over your judgments? Did you allow desires or aversions to dictate your behavior? Did you act according to reason, or were you swayed by external pressures?

3. **Practice Indifference to Externals**: In every situation, remind yourself that externals are beyond your control. By affirming this, you reduce their emotional hold over you. This does not mean neglecting effort or ambition, but rather detaching from the need for external validation or results. As Marcus Aurelius admonished: “Do not dream of possession of what you do not have; but reflect on the greatest blessings in what you already possess, and, out of them, select what you would have lost had they not been yours.”

4. **Preemptive Negative Visualization (Premeditatio Malorum)**: Regularly practice imagining potential misfortunes—loss of wealth, failure, illness—not with dread, but as a rehearsal for cultivating resilience. By preparing your mind to face these contingencies, you strengthen your control over your judgments and emotional responses.

5. **Reframe Setbacks as Opportunities for Virtue**: Every obstacle, failure, or challenge presents an opportunity to exercise Stoic virtues. Where a non-Stoic may see only frustration, the Stoic sees a chance to strengthen fortitude, to practice patience, and to reaffirm commitment to reasoned action.

Would this deeper delineation suffice in offering practical insight, or is there any specific aspect you'd prefer I elaborate on further?
