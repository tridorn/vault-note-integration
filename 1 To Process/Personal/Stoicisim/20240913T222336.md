# How to keep in line with stoicism

Your inquiry might be refined as: *"How can I effectively correct myself and stay aligned with Stoic principles in daily life? Should I follow an abstract, overarching sense of Stoicism, consciously remind myself of specific virtues, or use longer, specific quotes or sayings from Stoic texts?"*

In Stoicism, there are several practical methods for keeping yourself aligned with its teachings, and it’s important to adapt the approach that works best for your own temperament and context. The key, however, is **conscious awareness** and **deliberate reflection** on virtue. Each of the approaches you mentioned—forming an abstract picture, focusing on specific virtues, or using quotes—can be useful, depending on the situation. Here's a breakdown of each method and when it might be most effective:

### 1. **Forming an Abstract Picture of Stoicism**
Creating an overarching, abstract understanding of Stoicism as a guiding framework can be helpful for maintaining a broad sense of **direction** in your daily life. By internalizing the **general Stoic mindset**, you can naturally align your actions with its principles without needing constant, conscious reminders.

- **Pros**: Having a well-formed, internalized picture of Stoicism allows for a more fluid and intuitive approach to virtue. Over time, the Stoic worldview becomes your default frame of reference, and you will instinctively act in ways that align with Stoic teachings, particularly in unplanned or sudden situations.

- **Cons**: The abstract approach may lack precision and may allow for vagueness or occasional drift if not coupled with more concrete reminders or self-checks. When life becomes stressful or overwhelming, relying solely on an abstract sense may not provide the necessary **clarity** or **guidance** in specific situations.

- **Application**: The abstract picture of Stoicism is especially useful when dealing with broad challenges or when you’re trying to shape your general character over time. It serves as a **mental anchor**, giving you a constant reference point, but it should be reinforced by more concrete reflection at times.

**Best Used For**: General orientation, shaping long-term habits, and staying aligned with Stoicism when navigating complex or multifaceted situations.

### 2. **Reminding Yourself of Specific Virtues**
Focusing on **specific Stoic virtues**—**wisdom**, **justice**, **courage**, and **temperance**—at the moment of action is a highly practical way to apply Stoicism in everyday life. By deliberately asking yourself, “Am I acting with wisdom, justice, courage, or temperance?” before making a decision, you engage directly with Stoic teachings and keep them at the forefront of your mind.

- **Pros**: This method provides a **clear and practical** way to ensure your actions align with Stoic principles. It also helps you engage deeply with the specific virtues, giving each decision a thoughtful and reflective grounding. This approach can be used in real time to correct yourself immediately when faced with moral or ethical dilemmas.

- **Cons**: This method requires deliberate attention and may feel cumbersome or forced in highly spontaneous or stressful situations. It also may require practice to integrate this method into your decision-making without slowing down your response or creating hesitation.

- **Application**: You might use this method by consciously asking yourself before any decision, “Is this action temperate? Is it just?” Over time, the virtues will become more naturally integrated into your thought process, allowing you to apply them instinctively. Additionally, if you notice yourself acting in a way that contradicts one of the virtues, you can quickly correct course by reflecting on the specific virtue that needs attention.

**Best Used For**: Immediate decision-making, correcting behavior in the moment, and ensuring a **virtue-centered response** to everyday situations.

### 3. **Using Stoic Quotes or Citations**
Using **specific Stoic sayings** or quotes, such as from **Epictetus**, **Seneca**, or **Marcus Aurelius**, can serve as powerful reminders and correctives. These short phrases or longer reflections can be mentally repeated or written down as reminders to help you realign your thoughts and actions when needed.

- **Pros**: Stoic quotes are often **succinct**, **memorable**, and deeply **reflective**, providing quick and effective mental corrections. They can immediately bring you back to a Stoic mindset, especially in moments of emotional disturbance or indecision. For example, Marcus Aurelius’ quote, *“You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength,”* can serve as an instant reminder to regain control over your thoughts when facing adversity.

- **Cons**: Over-relying on quotes can make Stoicism feel like a collection of **disconnected aphorisms**, rather than a fully integrated philosophy. Also, while quotes are powerful in certain situations, they might not provide the **contextual depth** needed for more complex or nuanced decisions.

- **Application**: You can keep a journal or list of key Stoic quotes that resonate with you and refer to them throughout the day. Alternatively, you could mentally repeat a particular Stoic maxim when faced with difficult emotions or decisions, such as repeating *“What is up to me?”* (Epictetus) to remind yourself to focus on what you can control.

**Best Used For**: Quick mental reminders, moments of emotional or mental distress, and keeping Stoic wisdom **immediately accessible** when facing difficulties.

### 4. **Journaling and Reflection**
While not directly mentioned in your question, **journaling** is a powerful Stoic practice that could integrate the benefits of the three methods you mentioned. Writing down reflections on how well you adhered to Stoic principles throughout the day allows for **self-correction** and deeper engagement with the virtues.

- **Example**: At the end of the day, you might write, “Did I act with courage when I faced that difficult conversation today? How could I have shown more temperance in that stressful situation?” Journaling encourages ongoing reflection, helping you see patterns and areas where you can improve, keeping you aligned with the philosophy.

**Best Used For**: Deep self-reflection, long-term character development, and reviewing progress in aligning with Stoic principles.

The most effective way to **correct yourself** and **stay aligned with Stoic principles** likely involves using **a combination of these approaches**:
