# Complete picture of things under our control

You might have formulated your inquiry more rigorously as: "Are the four categories of wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance—along with their applications in judgment and action—comprehensive in outlining everything that falls under one's control in the Stoic framework?"

To address this incisively: No, the four cardinal virtues are not themselves *things* that are under our control, but rather the **framework** through which we judge and act virtuously in situations. What is truly under our control, in Stoic terms, is far more fundamental, pertaining to our **inner faculties**—the domain of thought, choice, and assent. These virtues are the *means* by which we apply control over that inner domain. Let's delineate more explicitly what constitutes *everything* that is under your control.

### The Complete Picture: What Is In Our Control in Stoicism

At the core, Stoicism posits that **everything under our control** boils down to three critical areas: 

1. **Our Assent to Impressions**: This is the power to agree or disagree with the thoughts or perceptions that enter our consciousness.
2. **Our Desires and Aversions**: This refers to how we direct our emotional energies—what we choose to pursue or avoid.
3. **Our Actions**: This encompasses how we decide to behave, what we choose to do or not do, based on our rational deliberation.

Together, these make up the **totality** of what falls under our control. The Stoics use these concepts to address the broadest possible spectrum of human experiences, and everything else is classified as external—beyond our control. Now, let us delve into these specific areas more comprehensively.

### 1. **Assent to Impressions (Sunkatathesis)**

Impressions (*phantasiai*) are the automatic responses we have to external stimuli—what we think or feel the moment something happens. These impressions are often involuntary, like the immediate sense of fear upon hearing bad news, or the joy we feel when praised. But according to the Stoics, **we control whether we give assent** to these impressions—whether we agree with and act upon them, or reject them as irrational or irrelevant.

#### Practical Example:
Suppose you are publicly criticized. Your first, automatic impression might be to feel hurt or angry. However, your **assent** is within your control. You can choose to interpret the criticism as harmful, internalize it, and react with anger, or you can withhold assent, examining the criticism rationally to decide whether it merits a response at all. In this sense, the **impression** is outside of your control, but **your assent**—your agreement or rejection of that impression—is fully within your control.

#### Implication:
This ability to control what you assent to is the bedrock of Stoic freedom. While you cannot control external events, you can control the meanings you assign to them. Through this discipline, you prevent external impressions from dictating your emotional or mental state, thus preserving your autonomy.

### 2. **Our Desires and Aversions (Hormê and Echthra)**

The second domain under your control is the realm of desire (what you seek) and aversion (what you avoid). In Stoic philosophy, the key to tranquility is ensuring that you desire only what is within your control and avoid attaching yourself to what is outside of it. Your desires and aversions are based on the judgments you make about what is good or bad, and because judgments are within your control, so too are your desires and aversions.

#### Practical Example:
You may desire wealth or status, things which are clearly outside your control, and when they fail to materialize, you experience frustration or disappointment. Conversely, if you **desire** only to act virtuously—something entirely within your control—then you free yourself from the emotional turbulence that comes with failing to achieve external goals. Similarly, if you only feel aversion toward vice or irrational behavior, rather than external misfortunes like illness or poverty, you maintain serenity even in adversity.

#### Implication:
Mastering your desires and aversions is crucial to living the Stoic ideal of tranquility (*ataraxia*). When you narrow your desires to things that lie within your power—acting with virtue, maintaining rationality—you develop resilience against the inevitable disappointments and setbacks of external life.

### 3. **Our Actions (Prohairesis)**

The final area of control is your **prohairesis**, or moral will. This refers to your capacity to choose your actions and responses. While external factors (other people’s behavior, social conditions, etc.) may influence the circumstances of your action, **you alone control how you respond to them**. Your will determines how you execute your decisions and whether those decisions align with virtue. 

#### Practical Example:
Imagine being wronged by a colleague. While you cannot control their behavior or the harm they may have caused, you control your response. Will you retaliate in anger or respond with measured justice? **Your action**, rooted in rational deliberation, is what defines whether your response is virtuous.

#### Implication:
Your actions represent your agency in the world. No external obstacle can prevent you from choosing a virtuous action, even if it means refraining from action altogether. This makes your **prohairesis** central to Stoic ethics—it is the vessel through which all moral agency flows.

### 4. **Judgments (Dogmata)**

Beneath these three areas of control lies a fourth, more foundational element: your **judgments** (*dogmata*). The Stoics argue that it is not events themselves that disturb us, but our judgments about them. Because judgments are the product of our reason, they too fall within our sphere of control.

#### Practical Example:
In a situation where you face a serious illness, your judgment about the illness—whether you view it as catastrophic or as something that can be borne with fortitude—determines your emotional response. The illness itself lies outside of your control, but your **judgment** about the illness is within your power to adjust.

#### Implication:
The Stoic path to virtue is largely a path of refining one’s judgments. By making correct judgments about what is truly good (virtue) and what is indifferent (external circumstances), you free yourself from unnecessary suffering and align your actions with reason.

### Are These Everything?

Yes, these four faculties—**assent to impressions**, **desires and aversions**, **actions**, and **judgments**—together form the **complete picture** of what is in your control according to Stoicism. The cardinal virtues of wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance are the **qualities** or **virtues** that guide how you exercise control over these faculties. But it is ultimately these internal faculties that represent the totality of what lies within the Stoic’s power.

The external world—other people, your body’s health, material wealth, reputation, or even life itself—remains outside of your control. But within these four areas, you possess absolute sovereignty. Mastery of these inner domains constitutes freedom in Stoic terms: the ability to maintain virtue, peace of mind, and moral clarity regardless of external circumstances.

### The Importance of Self-Reflection

Given the abstract nature of these internal faculties, Stoic practice also emphasizes continuous **self-examination** to better understand how you are exercising control in your daily life. By examining your daily responses, questioning your judgments, and refining your desires and aversions, you can ensure that your choices are consistently virtuous.

Would you say this comprehensive outline offers clarity on what constitutes control in Stoicism, or are there specific elements that remain ambiguous in your own practice of this philosophy?
