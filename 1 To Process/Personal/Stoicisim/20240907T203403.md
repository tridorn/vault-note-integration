# Work in stoicism

You might have phrased your request more precisely as: "While Stoicism focuses on virtuous living over material success, how does a Stoic engage in the practical pursuit of traditional achievements such as career goals, personal success, and material accomplishments?"

### **The Stoic Approach to Work and Traditional Success:**

Stoicism does not reject the pursuit of traditional goals—such as career success, wealth, or personal achievements—but it offers a **different perspective** on how one should approach and value these endeavors. A Stoic engages with worldly pursuits while maintaining an internal focus on virtue, self-control, and detachment from outcomes. The key lies in **how** you pursue these goals, not in the goals themselves.

Here’s how a Stoic works toward and achieves traditional things:

---

### **1. Pursue External Goals as “Preferred Indifferents”:**

In Stoicism, external things like career success, wealth, status, or recognition are considered **preferred indifferents**. This means they are **not inherently good or bad** but can be pursued if done so in accordance with virtue. A Stoic sees such goals as preferable (because they can contribute to a more comfortable or stable life), but they are not **necessary** for happiness or fulfillment.

- **What This Means in Practice**: You can strive for career advancement, financial success, or personal achievements, but you should **not rely on them** for your sense of worth or happiness. You pursue these things with effort and discipline, but you are detached from their ultimate value. You understand that achieving them does not make you more virtuous, nor does failing to achieve them diminish your character.

- **Example Thought**: "I will work diligently toward my promotion because it aligns with my responsibilities and skills, but I understand that my happiness comes from acting with virtue, not from whether or not I get the promotion."

---

### **2. Focus on the Process, Not the Outcome:**

The Stoic sage is highly focused on **the process** of action rather than the outcome. This means that, while working toward traditional achievements, you place the highest value on the **effort, discipline, and intention** behind your actions, rather than the external results. Success is measured by whether you acted virtuously—whether you applied wisdom, courage, and justice in your work—not by whether the desired outcome was achieved.

- **What This Means in Practice**: In your career or personal projects, focus on **working diligently**, applying reason and virtue to each step of the process. You put in full effort without being overly concerned with the final result. If the result aligns with your hopes, that’s a bonus. If not, you maintain peace because you know you gave your best effort.

- **Example Thought**: "I will give my all to this project, ensuring I act with integrity and wisdom. If the project succeeds, I will accept the success calmly. If it fails, I will learn from it and move on without regret."

---

### **3. Work in Service of Virtue and the Common Good:**

Stoicism teaches that our actions should contribute to the **common good** and be aligned with **justice**. In practical terms, this means that while you pursue traditional achievements, you must always ensure that your actions are **ethically sound** and beneficial not just to yourself but to society at large. For a Stoic, personal success is not just about self-advancement but about **living in accordance with nature** and **fulfilling one’s duty** to others.

- **What This Means in Practice**: You should ask yourself how your work and achievements contribute to society or to the well-being of others. Do your actions promote fairness, equity, and justice? Are you treating others with respect in your pursuit of success? If your work aligns with these values, it is worth pursuing.

- **Example Thought**: "I will strive for success in this business, but I will do so with honesty and fairness. My work should benefit both myself and others, and I will not compromise my integrity for the sake of material gain."

---

### **4. Embrace Hard Work and Discipline (Courage and Temperance):**

Stoicism emphasizes **self-discipline**, **effort**, and **perseverance** in all endeavors. A Stoic does not shy away from hard work or challenges. Instead, you embrace them as opportunities to practice virtue—specifically **courage** (facing difficulty with resolve) and **temperance** (maintaining balance and self-control in the face of challenges). For a Stoic, work is a way to **train your character**.

- **What This Means in Practice**: When you encounter obstacles in your career or personal goals, you face them with determination and patience. Rather than avoiding discomfort, you see it as a means to grow in virtue. You discipline yourself to work hard without becoming overly attached to the fruits of your labor.

- **Example Thought**: "This task is difficult, but I will approach it with courage and temperance. The harder the task, the more opportunity I have to strengthen my character and prove my resilience."

---

### **5. Cultivate Patience and Long-Term Thinking:**

A Stoic mind remains focused on the **long-term process** of growth and development, rather than on immediate gratification. Stoics understand that meaningful work often takes time, and they cultivate **patience** in the pursuit of traditional success. Whether in a career, personal relationships, or other endeavors, Stoics adopt a steady and thoughtful approach, not rushing or succumbing to impulsive decisions.

- **What This Means in Practice**: In your career or projects, practice **delayed gratification**. You invest in long-term goals with persistence, recognizing that success may take time. You avoid shortcuts that compromise virtue, knowing that slow and steady progress is more valuable than quick success achieved unethically.

- **Example Thought**: "I will continue working toward my long-term goal, even if progress is slow. My success is not measured by immediate results but by the consistency and integrity of my efforts over time."

---

### **6. Detach from External Validation:**

While traditional success often brings external validation—praise, recognition, or status—a Stoic works without seeking or relying on such validation. **Self-worth** is based on the virtue of your actions, not on whether others acknowledge or reward your efforts. A Stoic does not work for applause but for the internal satisfaction of acting rightly.

- **What This Means in Practice**: You pursue your goals without concern for whether others praise or criticize you. External recognition is considered a neutral byproduct of your actions, not the goal itself. You work quietly and diligently, content with the knowledge that you have acted virtuously, regardless of whether others notice.

- **Example Thought**: "I will complete this task with excellence, knowing that my work reflects my commitment to virtue. Whether others recognize my efforts is irrelevant to my sense of fulfillment."

---

### **7. Accept Success and Failure Equally (Amor Fati):**

A Stoic accepts **both success and failure** with equanimity, practicing *amor fati*—the love of fate. If success is achieved, the Stoic accepts it without excessive pride or attachment. If failure occurs, the Stoic embraces it as part of the natural unfolding of events and uses it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Success and failure are both indifferent in the Stoic view; what matters is how you respond to them.

- **What This Means in Practice**: You approach success and failure as two sides of the same coin. You work hard to achieve your goals, but when outcomes do not align with your expectations, you accept them without complaint. Instead of feeling defeated by failure, you see it as a chance to practice resilience and wisdom.

- **Example Thought**: "If I succeed, I will accept the success calmly and without attachment. If I fail, I will reflect on the lessons learned and move forward without regret."

---

### **8. Practice Gratitude for Opportunities to Work:**

A Stoic maintains an attitude of **gratitude** for the opportunities life provides, including the chance to work and strive toward goals. Even in mundane or challenging tasks, a Stoic finds value in the opportunity to engage with life’s processes and practice virtue.

- **What This Means in Practice**: You approach each day’s work with gratitude, recognizing that each task—no matter how small or difficult—is an opportunity to contribute to the world, grow in virtue, and fulfill your role within the larger order of Nature.

- **Example Thought**: "I am grateful for the opportunity to work and engage with life. Every task I undertake is a chance to apply my reason, improve my character, and contribute to the common good."

---

### **Conclusion:**
In Stoicism, the pursuit of traditional achievements—whether in career, wealth, or personal success—is not rejected but recontextualized. A Stoic works toward these goals with full effort, but without emotional attachment to the outcomes. Success is reframed from external results to virtuous action, and each endeavor becomes an opportunity to practice wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. By focusing on the process, maintaining ethical integrity, and accepting both success and failure with equanimity, the Stoic achieves traditional goals while remaining grounded in inner peace and virtue.
