# Amor Fati

Your question could have been phrased as: "Did you refer to *amor fati* as a more radical concept only from the perspective of non-Stoics, or is it also contested within Stoic philosophy? Additionally, does my interpretation of *fate*—as referring exclusively to past events—align with the Stoic understanding?"

### **Amor Fati: Radical for Non-Stoics, Central to Stoicism**

When I referred to *amor fati* as a "radical" idea, I was highlighting how this concept can be seen as challenging or extreme from the perspective of non-Stoic or conventional thinking. For many people outside Stoicism, the idea of actively embracing everything that happens—good or bad—may seem counterintuitive, especially when it involves accepting suffering or loss. However, within Stoicism, *amor fati* is a widely accepted and essential principle. It is not disputed within the Stoic tradition; rather, it is regarded as a vital aspect of living in accordance with nature and the *Logos* (universal reason).

### **The Full Scope of Amor Fati in Stoicism:**

In Stoicism, *amor fati*—"love of fate"—extends beyond merely accepting past events. It involves a wholehearted embrace of **all events**, past, present, and future, as necessary parts of the cosmic order. The Stoics believed that everything happens according to the rational order of the universe (*Logos*), and therefore, everything that occurs—both good and bad—is ultimately for the best. Loving fate means not just reconciling oneself with past events, but also accepting and welcoming whatever is to come, trusting that it is part of the greater cosmic harmony.

For a Stoic, loving fate is not passive resignation but an active engagement with life. It means seeing every event, even future adversity, as an opportunity to practice virtue. Marcus Aurelius famously wrote in his *Meditations*: "What happens to every man is his fate, and it is for his interest." This points to the Stoic belief that everything that happens—whether in the past, present, or future—is part of the natural unfolding of the universe and, thus, is in alignment with the *Logos*.

### **Your Past-Only Interpretation:**

Your interpretation of fate as applying solely to past events—since those are unchangeable and must therefore be accepted—is not incorrect, but it represents only part of the Stoic view. Stoicism indeed teaches that we must accept the past because it is beyond our control and unalterable. However, the concept of *fate* in Stoicism is much broader and includes the present and future as well.

Stoic *fate* (*heimarmene*) encompasses the entire course of events—past, present, and future—because everything that happens is part of the predetermined order governed by the *Logos*. This determinism suggests that future events are also fated, even though we do not yet know what they will be. Therefore, *amor fati* urges us to embrace not only what has already transpired but also whatever may occur in the future.

In Stoicism, fate is ongoing, and the acceptance of future events is just as critical as accepting past events. When a Stoic says "love fate," it means embracing the totality of your life, including the unpredictable and inevitable events that lie ahead.

### **Why Embrace Future Fate?**

For the Stoic, embracing future fate is not about passive acceptance but rather about **preparing** oneself to face the future with virtue. By adopting an attitude of *amor fati* toward what has yet to happen, you:
1. **Train your resilience** to face adversity with courage.
2. **Maintain inner peace** by not fretting over the uncontrollable.
3. **Focus on the present** by understanding that worrying about the future is futile, as future events are out of your hands.

In this sense, *amor fati* complements other Stoic practices like the **dichotomy of control** (focusing only on what is within your power) and **premeditatio malorum** (anticipating future difficulties with a calm mind). All of these practices aim to foster a state of equanimity and acceptance, no matter what may come.

### **Conclusion:**
Your interpretation of fate as focusing on past events is an understandable view, especially given that the past is fixed and unchangeable. However, within Stoicism, *amor fati* is a much more encompassing concept, embracing not only the past but also the present and future. Stoics believe in the total acceptance and even love of everything that has happened, is happening, and will happen, seeing it all as part of the rational order of the universe.

Therefore, *amor fati* is not just about making peace with the past, but about welcoming every part of life, including what is yet to come, as necessary and valuable for the cultivation of virtue and the fulfillment of one’s role in the grand cosmic order.
