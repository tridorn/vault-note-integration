	- **Flow Combinations (5 minutes)**

**Tips For Throughout the Day**:

- **Mindfulness**: Be aware of your movements throughout the day, aiming for smooth, deliberate actions in everything you do.
- **Practice Graceful Movements**: Incorporate slow, controlled movements into everyday tasks, such as standing up, sitting down, and walking.
- **Posture**: Maintain good posture, with shoulders back and head held high, to enhance the fluidity and grace of your movements.
