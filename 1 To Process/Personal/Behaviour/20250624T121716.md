New Way of Walking

- Land on heel 
- toes stretched outward
- Impact must be felt 
- Controlled pace

This way of walking gives natural control and stability, as heel-landing (if you do it right you're going to feel it, the impact is measurable) grounds the body

- lets arms swing behind back and outward at the front 
- Heels land somewhat at the front-centre
