# Evening Reflection

## Concept

### What Is Evening Reflection?

Evening reflection is a dedicated time, typically at the end of the day, when you pause to think about the events of the day, the choices you made, your reactions to various situations, and the outcomes of those choices and reactions.

### Purpose

1. **Self-awareness**: Helps in understanding one's thoughts, emotions, and actions on a daily basis.
2. **Learning**: Identifies what went well and what could have been done differently.
3. **Gratitude**: Recognizing and appreciating the good moments.
4. **Planning**: Sets the tone and intention for the following day.

### How To Practice Evening Reflection

1. **Find a Quiet Place**: Opt for a location free from distractions.
2. **Set a Specific Time**: Creating a routine around a specific time helps in making it a habit.

4. **Ask Reflective Questions**: Some questions you might consider include:
	 - What did I accomplish today?
	 - What brought me joy?
	 - What challenges did I face, and how did I handle them?
	 - Were there moments I wasn't proud of? Why did they happen?
	 - What did I learn about myself today?
	 - Is there something I need to let go of or forgive?
	 - What am I grateful for today?
5. **Visualize Tomorrow**: After reflecting on the day, take a few moments to visualize what you'd like the next day to look like. This can set a positive intention for the following day.
