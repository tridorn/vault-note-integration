"Your refinement is precise: 'How might one preserve sanity and steadfastness over an extended period of captivity, when faced with prolonged isolation and adversity?'"

For long-term endurance, the strategies must transcend mere survival and delve into cultivating purpose, identity, and meaning within confinement. Here is an expanded exploration:

---

### 1. **Constructing a Mental Framework of Purpose**
   - **Adopt a Meta-Narrative**: View the ordeal as a defining chapter in your life—a crucible through which you are tested and transformed. Philosophically reframe captivity as an opportunity to cultivate virtues like patience, courage, and resilience.
   - **Micro-Purposes**: Set progressive long-term goals, even if entirely mental. For instance, plan to memorize an epic poem, mentally 'write' a novel, or map out the world's geography in intricate detail.

---

### 2. **Self-Transcendence Through Inner Exploration**
   - **Spiritual or Philosophical Reflection**: Embrace meditative practices or delve into the metaphysical, exploring questions of existence, morality, or the nature of time. Borrow from Viktor Frankl's notion of finding meaning even in suffering.
   - **Dialogues with the Self**: Construct an internal dialogue—imagine conversations with historical figures, your future self, or a deity. Create debates, engage in moral dilemmas, or philosophically reflect on your past actions.

---

### 3. **Crafting an Internal Legacy**
   - **Mental Mastery Projects**: Create an imaginary "masterwork." This could be composing a symphony, designing a utopian city, or mentally solving unsolvable problems. Let this work become a grand, consuming endeavor that defines your mental landscape.
   - **Autobiography**: Revisit and meticulously reconstruct your life story. Reflect on every detail, decision, and emotion, transforming your memory into a monument of self-awareness.

---

### 4. **Imagination as a Sanctuary**
   - **Create Worlds**: Develop elaborate fictional realities, complete with characters, histories, and narratives. Populate these worlds and let them evolve over time.
   - **Sensory Visualization**: Recreate the sensations of freedom—imagine the sound of wind, the taste of favorite foods, or the feeling of running. These mental exercises anchor you to what lies beyond the walls.

---

### 5. **Building Cognitive Routines for Stability**
   - **Ritualization**: Establish a strict routine for mental and physical activities, even if contrived. Consistency provides structure, a sense of normalcy, and anchors the mind to productivity.
   - **Long-Term Learning**: Systematically teach yourself subjects—languages, mathematics, philosophy—by creating internal lessons. Treat your mind as both the student and teacher.

---

### 6. **Preserving Emotional Vitality**
   - **Positive Memory Anchors**: Revisit cherished memories with vivid detail. Draw strength from moments of love, triumph, or joy, using them as emotional sustenance.
   - **Gratitude Practices**: Even in adversity, search for small blessings: the body's resilience, a moment of stillness, or the strength to endure another day.

---

### 7. **Social and Historical Connection**
   - **Humanize Captors (If Applicable)**: If interactions exist, strategically foster dialogue. Building rapport humanizes both you and them, potentially altering the dynamic of captivity.
   - **Identify with Historical Resilience**: Reflect on figures like Nelson Mandela, Viktor Frankl, or Dostoevsky. Their ability to find meaning amidst suffering can serve as a model and bolster your resolve.

---

### 8. **Transcending Temporal Constraints**
   - **Living Beyond the Present**: Imagine life after captivity. Visualize the ways you will rebuild, the lessons you will teach, and the person you will become. Let this vision sustain you.
   - **Timelessness**: Practice living moment to moment, detaching from the passage of time. Adopt the Stoic principle of “amor fati,” embracing the situation as necessary and beyond reproach.

---

### 9. **Physical and Sensory Awareness**
   - **Bodily Autonomy**: Sustain health through movement, stretching, and controlled breathing. Even small gestures like tapping rhythms or pacing a confined space can stimulate sensory input and maintain sanity.
   - **Immersion in Detail**: Focus on minutiae in your environment. Explore textures, sounds, or shadows. This acute sensory focus can ground you in reality without succumbing to despair.

---

### 10. **Steeling the Mind Against Despair**
   - **Refuse to Succumb**: Make a deliberate choice to endure. As Dostoevsky said, "Man is a creature who can get accustomed to anything, and I think that is the best definition of him."
   - **Defiance as Identity**: Adopt an attitude of quiet rebellion against despair. Every day endured is a victory.

In essence, the long-term strategy revolves around self-transcendence, the construction of meaning, and the deliberate cultivation of purpose even in the absence of external validation. Shall we expand upon one of these elements further?
