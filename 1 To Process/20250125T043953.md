# Seeking and Observing Like a Business Person

To "walk around" with the mindset of a business person constantly seeking opportunities, you need to adopt a specific way of thinking and observing. Here are the questions to ask yourself and what to look for:

1. **What Problems Can I Solve?**
	- As you go about your day, ask yourself: "What problems or inconveniences are people facing here?"
	- Look for inefficiencies, things that frustrate people, or tasks that take too long. Every problem is a potential business opportunity.

2. **What's Missing Here?**
	- Look at your environment and think, "What is missing that could add value?"
	- This could be a product, a service, or an improvement to existing offerings.

3. **How Can This Be Done Better?**
	- Whenever you encounter a product, service, or process, ask: "How could this be improved?"
	- Think in terms of efficiency, cost reduction, time savings, or enhanced user experience.

4. **What Are People Complaining About?**
	- Pay attention to complaints, whether in person, online, or in the media. Complaints are direct insights into unmet needs and desires.
	- Consider how you could provide a solution or alternative to these pain points.

5. **What Trends Are Emerging?**
	- Observe what's trending in society, technology, and consumer behavior.
	- Ask yourself: "How can I capitalize on these trends? What new needs or desires are these trends creating?"

6. **Who Is My Potential Customer?**
	- Look at people around you and think about their lifestyles, habits, and challenges.
	- Consider how a new product or service could fit into their lives.

7. **What Resources Do I Have Access To?**
	- Consider the resources at your disposal – skills, contacts, knowledge – and think about how they could be leveraged for a business opportunity.
	- Think about how you can combine different resources in innovative ways.

8. **What Would I Want or Need?**
	- Reflect on your own experiences and needs. Often, your own frustrations can lead to universal solutions.
	- Think about how a solution to your own problems could appeal to others.

9. **What's Working Well in Other Places?**
	- Look at successful businesses or trends in other areas or industries. Think about how these could be adapted or imported to your current environment.
	- This includes considering global trends or successes and how they could be localized.

10. **What Networking Opportunities Are Here?**
	 - In social situations, consider who around you might offer new perspectives, skills, or partnership opportunities.
	 - Networking isn't just about what you can get from others, but also what you can offer. Mutual benefit is key.

By constantly asking these questions and observing the world through this lens, you'll train yourself to spot business opportunities almost instinctively. Remember, this isn't about forcing ideas but rather staying open and receptive to the potential that surrounds you in everyday life.
