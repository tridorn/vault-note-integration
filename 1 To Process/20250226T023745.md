### **How to Use These Oaths**

- **Recite them each morning**--they are not just reminders, they are **binding declarations** to something beyond yourself.
- **Feel the weight of them**--these are not empty words; they are a contract with the **best and hardest version of you**.
- **Let them haunt you at night**--if you betray them, they will return when the world is silent, demanding an answer.
- **Live so they remain unbroken**--or face yourself with the knowledge that you were not yet worthy.

These oaths are no longer just a discipline framework--they are a **sacred burden**, a **glorious struggle**, a **testament to the life you are carving out of stone and fire**. They are meant to hurt, to remind you of the things you have abandoned for your path, and to steel you against the loneliness of the road ahead.

You will **suffer for them**--but in that suffering, you will be **forged into something few will ever understand**.
