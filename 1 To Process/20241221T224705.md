Certainly! Below is a **clear delineation** of the phases in this refined Stoic noting system. Each phase has a distinct purpose, tools, and guiding questions to keep the flow structured and actionable.

---

### **Phase 1: Noticing**

The act of becoming aware of your thoughts, feelings, or actions in the present moment.

- **Purpose:**  
  To catch yourself in a mental, emotional, or behavioral pattern.  
- **Tools:**  
  - Mindful attention.
  - Gentle curiosity (observe without judgment).  
- **Guiding Questions:**  
  - “What is arising in my mind right now?”  
  - “Am I caught in thought, emotion, or impulse?”

---

### **Phase 2: Noting (Applying the Disciplines)**

Categorizing what you notice into one of the three Stoic disciplines: **Assent, Desire/Aversion, or Action.**  
This step ensures you're observing patterns in a structured way.

- **Purpose:**  
  To clarify which Stoic discipline is active and label the type of thought, feeling, or action.  
- **Tools:**  
  - Labels for each discipline (see below).  
  - Simple mental note: "Judging," "Desiring," etc.  
- **Guiding Questions:**  
  - **Assent (Thought):** “Am I giving assent to an impression? What am I thinking or believing?”  
	 - Labels: *Judging, Thinking, Believing.*  
  - **Desire/Aversion (Feeling):** “Am I craving or avoiding something? How do I feel?”  
	 - Labels: *Desiring, Fearing, Gratitude.*  
  - **Action (Action):** “What am I doing or avoiding right now?”  
	 - Labels: *Avoiding, Reacting, Engaging.*

### **Phase 3: Reflecting (Identifying the Virtue)**

Assessing the situation and choosing the appropriate Stoic virtue for guidance.

- **Purpose:**  
  To pause and align with Stoic virtues (**Wisdom, Courage, Justice, Temperance**).  
- **Tools:**  
  - Stoic principles.  
  - Key reflection questions (below).  
- **Guiding Questions:**  
  - **Wisdom:** “Am I seeing this clearly? Is this impression true or false?”  
  - **Courage:** “Am I avoiding discomfort? What would courage do here?”  
  - **Justice:** “Am I treating others fairly? What is my duty?”  
  - **Temperance:** “Am I showing balance and self-control?”  

---

### **Phase 4: Redirecting (Choosing the Virtuous Path)**

Replacing unhelpful thoughts, feelings, or actions with a virtuous alternative.

- **Purpose:**  
  To gently shift toward virtuous thinking and action, guided by the reflection phase.  
- **Tools:**  
  - Stoic maxims for quick guidance.  
  - Clear actionable steps to move forward.  
- **Guiding Questions:**  
  - “What would a virtuous person do in this situation?”  
  - “What’s the smallest step I can take to align with virtue?”  
- **Examples of Redirection:**  
  - Replace **"They’re wrong!"** with **"How can I respond justly?"**  
  - Replace **"I’m anxious about failing"** with **"I’ll prepare diligently and accept the outcome."**  

---

### **Phase 5: Moving On**

Releasing the thought, feeling, or action and returning to the present moment.

- **Purpose:**  
  To let go of unnecessary rumination and focus on the next task or moment.  
- **Tools:**  
  - Acknowledge progress.
  - Refocus your attention.  
- **Guiding Questions:**  
  - “Have I redirected this effectively?”  
  - “What’s next for me to focus on?”

### **Flow Chart of the Process**

1. **Noticing:**  
	- Awareness arises: “What’s happening now?”
2. **Noting:**  
	- Label it by discipline: "Judging," "Desiring," "Avoiding."
3. **Reflecting:**  
	- Ask: “What virtue applies? How should I respond?”
4. **Redirecting:**  
	- Replace with a virtuous thought or action.
5. **Moving On:**  
	- Release and refocus: “What’s my next step?”

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Scenario: Anxiety Before a Presentation**

1. **Noticing:**  
	- You feel nervous, with thoughts of failure racing through your mind.  
	- Awareness: "I’m anxious."  

2. **Noting (Discipline of Desire/Aversion):**  
	- Label: "Fearing" (I’m fearing judgment or failure).  

3. **Reflecting (Virtue of Courage):**  
	- Ask: “What would courage do? Fear is discomfort; virtue lies in acting despite it.”  

4. **Redirecting:**  
	- Replace: “What if I fail?” with “I’ll focus on preparing well and let go of the outcome.”  

5. **Moving On:**  
	- Refocus: “I’ll review my slides and rehearse the intro.”
