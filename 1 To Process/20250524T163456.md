### 1 First-principle constraints

1. **Factory KPI ≠ "participation count."** Its legitimacy depends on the number of spin-out-ready opportunities delivered per year.

2. **Studio bandwidth is scarce.** Every weak project accepted into the pipeline consumes option-gate diligence and dilutes attention.

3. **Regional talent depth is uneven.** You cannot assume a steady flow of full-stack founder dyads each quarter.

Therefore any "light" offering must **broaden the funnel** without **corrupting the signal** that feeds the option gate.

### 2 Two-tier programme structure

| Tier | Objective | Participant profile | Cost per team | Factory resource load | Studio involvement | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Core Validation Sprint** | Produce spin-out-ready projects | PhD + MBA / seasoned engineer + operator | €8-10 k | High (venture architect, prototyping budget) | Observer only | 
| **Exploration Track ("Light")** | Identify _latent_ founders, surface problems worth solving | B.Sc. candidates, corporate intrapreneurs, foreign exchange students | €0.5-1 k | Low (online modules, 1 workshop, no prototype budget) | None | 

_Exploration_ is **breadth-first scouting**. Any project graduating from Exploration must re-apply for the next Validation Sprint--**no fast-track, no Studio option**. This preserves gating integrity.

* * *

### 3 Operational modelling for the light track

**Format**

- 4-week, remote-first curriculum:

    1. Problem framing (Lean, IP search).

    2. Customer discovery basics.

    3. Pitch canvas + next-step plan.
- One Saturday in-person workshop for final pitches.
- Max 25 teams / cohort, three cohorts per year.

**Resources**

- 0.25 FTE programme coordinator.
- Recorded lectures donated by professors or alumni.
- €500 trophy budget + coffee.

**Cost coverage**

- €200 participation fee (waived for STEM students).
- €5 k per cohort sponsorship from a corporate CSR budget.
- Net zero outlay after year one.

**Quality filter**

- Online application with automated scoring (CV, problem statement, time-commitment test).
- Top 25 accepted; top 5 pitch live; none proceed automatically.

### 4 Rational benefits

| Stakeholder | Benefit from Exploration Track | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Universities** | Broader entrepreneurial exposure for undergrads without diluting faculty research time. | 
| **Corporates** | CSR optics; early view on motivated intrapreneurs; pipeline for hackathon talent. | 
| **Factory** | Larger radar surface with negligible incremental budget; talent heat-map for future sprints. | 
| **Studio** | Maintains purity of Validation pipeline; receives quarterly scouting report without diligence burden. | 
* * *

### 5 Risk controls

1. **Resource bleed** -- cap coordinator hours and budget; automate content.

2. **Brand dilution** -- market the Exploration Track explicitly as _pre-incubator_, not as core Factory programme.

3. **False expectations** -- contractual disclaimer: completion ≠ admission to Validation Sprint, ≠ funding.
* * *

### 6 Decision algorithm for scaling
    
    
    If   (Validation Sprint applicant pool < 3× cohort size)
    and  (≥20 % of Validation admits originated in Exploration)
    then increase Exploration cohort size or frequency
    else keep constant
    

This keeps Exploration strictly subordinate to Validation needs.

* * *

### 7 Execution next steps

1. **Template build**: record three 15-minute micro-lectures, upload to LMS.

2. **Automation**: Typeform application → Airtable scoring → Zapier invites.

3. **Pilot**: run 15-team Exploration in October; post-mortem metrics: completion rate, NPS, candidate quality.

4. **Board report**: present data; decide whether to institutionalise track for 2026 budget.

* * *

**Conclusion**  
Offer a _light_ Exploration Track to widen your funnel, but wall it off structurally and legally. Maintain the Validation Sprint as the sole gateway to Studio options. That preserves signal quality while monetising and de-risking early curiosity in a talent-scarce environment.
