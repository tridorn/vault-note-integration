**You said:**

**How to get mileage out of this**  
- See these top-level clusters not as *folders*, but as *MOC (Map of Content) notes*. Each cluster note can house references to sub-notes.  
- Let your **true usage** guide which clusters flourish and which remain dormant.  
- Don’t be afraid to **copy a note’s link** into multiple clusters if it’s relevant in more than one place.  
- Over time, **watch for emergent sub-clusters**: e.g., within *Knowledge Domains*, you might find a rich branch of *Neuroscience* that becomes its own MOC.  

This approach balances structure with serendipity. You don’t foreclose any unforeseen connections, but you do anchor your major conceptual directions.
