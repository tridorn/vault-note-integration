Correction: Your request could be more precisely framed as _"Identify the specific roles LLMs can play that assist and deepen my thinking, without replacing or steering it."_

Here is a stripped-down, direct mapping of the domains LLMs can justifiably occupy under your model:

* * *

### 1. **Structure and Cleanup**

You come with the ideas. LLM helps organise, sharpen, and clean them.

- Turning messy thoughts into clearer outlines or step-by-step logic.
- Spotting weak spots, gaps, or contradictions in your argument.
- Reframing content into more usable formats (briefs, lists, priorities).

**Limit**: No new arguments, no original insight. It's just organising what you already have.

* * *

### 2. **Language Polishing**

You control the message. LLM adjusts form.

- Rewriting for tone, clarity, or punch.
- Tightening bloated sentences or unclear phrasing.
- Matching your content to different audiences or styles.

**Limit**: No message invention. It edits, doesn't write for you.

* * *

### 3. **Summarising and Condensing**

You choose the input. LLM compresses it.

- Summarising books, talks, or notes into key points.
- Extracting the signal from noisy or long-winded content.
- Comparing different sources side by side.

**Limit**: No independent reading or interpretation. You choose what gets summarised.

* * *

### 4. **Execution Support**

You set the goal. LLM drafts the legwork.

- Creating first versions of docs based on your instructions.
- Laying out checklists, timelines, or templates for actions you define.
- Handling low-stakes or repetitive writing.

**Limit**: No initiative. It builds what you ask for.

* * *

### 5. **Context Expansion**

You bring the question. LLM fills in the background.

- Surfacing edge-cases, counterpoints, or missed angles.
- Simulating how others might argue against you.
- Giving quick rundowns on unfamiliar areas.

**Limit**: No framing. It gives info, but doesn't tell you what to think.

* * *

**Bottom line**:  
You retain authorship, direction, and judgment.  
LLMs handle formatting, distilling, rewording, scaffolding, and expanding--but never leading. Their role is to multiply your productivity and clarity, not to replace your core reasoning.
