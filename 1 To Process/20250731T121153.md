**Correction.** The question should be stated: _"Given that I previously intended to publish under the 'Tristan Dornhelm' persona via dornhelm.com, should I now reorient that platform toward a distinct project identity, and if so, how should I restructure the assets and narrative alignment?"_
* * *

### Assessment

Publishing under _Tristan Dornhelm_--a constructed but still personal identity--risks conflating authorial authority with framework legitimacy. In the short term, it accelerates traction via personality; in the long term, it dilutes institutional gravity, limits handoff flexibility, and binds the intellectual agenda to the fate of the persona.

You are not writing memoirs. You are constructing an operating system. The brand must reflect that.

### Strategic Options

| Option | Description | Advantages | Costs | Long-term Strategic Alignment | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **A. Continue as 'Tristan Dornhelm'** | Publish directly under that name on dornhelm.com. | Simple; continuity; can build a thought-leader following. | Personalises the framework; harder to evolve into institution or delegate later. | **Misaligned**-- persona-first model. | 
| **B. Recast Dornhelm.com as a shell for a project identity**(**Recommended**) | Use dornhelm.com as the platform host, but rebrand visually and narratively around a project label (e.g. _"The Reform Core"_, _"Adaptive Orders"_, _"Civic Systems Lab"_). Dornhelm becomes "founding steward" or silent curator. | Retains asset; clean pivot; grants institutional authority to the framework. | Requires some reframing and new branding layer. | **Aligned** -- project-first; persona as emissary. | 
| **C. Abandon and relaunch under new domain** | Let dornhelm.com go dormant; publish via new branded domain. | Clean separation; no legacy trace. | Loses early domain equity and any visibility built. | Aligned, but inefficient. | 
* * *

### Tactical Recommendation

Proceed with **Option B**. Reposition _dornhelm.com_ not as a persona blog, but as the platform of a sovereign-design project. Tristan Dornhelm becomes either:

- A background presence (e.g., brief founder intro, no bylines), or
- A front-facing steward (voice of the podcast, logistics communicator), never the source of theory.

**Domain handling:** Keep dornhelm.com, but anchor the public branding to the project. Use visual hierarchy and content structure to center the project. Example:
- **Header/Logo:** _The Modular Sovereignty Project_
- **Byline or footer:** "Curated by Tristan Dornhelm" or "Published by the Dornhelm Group"

This preserves continuity while decoupling ego from architecture.

### Execution Priorities

1. **Rebrand Site.** Change title, tagline, and metadata to the project name. Dornhelm appears only in the "About" or in logistical posts (e.g., publishing schedules).

2. **Establish Content Split.**

    - Project posts: essays, theory, system designs (authored by the lab or project name).

    - Dornhelm posts: brief commentary, update memos, perhaps a quarterly synthesis.

3. **Visual Style Guide.** Adopt branding aesthetics consistent with institutional gravitas: restrained palette, clean typesetting, no personal imagery.
* * *

### Downstream Implications

- **Funders:** Easier to approach as an institutional initiative, not a personal brand.
- **Collaborators:** Can join or publish under project name, not as "guest of Dornhelm".
- **Succession:** If needed, Dornhelm can exit, and the project persists without cognitive dissonance.
* * *

**Final Judgment.** Do not abandon dornhelm.com. Convert it. You're not building a persona-centric blog. You're building the surface layer of a new ideological operating system. Treat the persona as the administrator of the launch phase, not the object of attention.
