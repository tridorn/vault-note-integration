Your prompt should have been: _"Rationally assess whether Cells should be treated as standalone structural units or only as substructures of Missions, and refine the overall theory of units and their assignment logic across the company."_

* * *

## I. Reassessment of Cells:

**Should Cells be standalone execution units?**  
**No.** That would be structurally incoherent.

### Rational Grounds:

1. **Cells lack mandate.**  
They do not possess output accountability. They have no charter, no FO, no timeline ownership.  
A structural unit without these is not sovereign--it is scaffolding.

2. **Cells require an operating container.**  
Without a Mission (or above), there is no ledger of performance, no decision checkpoint, no integration logic.  
Allowing them to operate independently introduces coordination bleed, duplication, and misattribution of work.

3. **Cells are tactical decomposition, not planning units.**  
You don't plan Cells--you _use_ them.

> **Conclusion**: Cells are not standalone units. They exist exclusively **inside** Missions (and possibly exceptional Projects), as **execution pods**, not output-bearers.
* * *

## II. Refined Theory of Units

Define each unit by three essential qualifiers:

| Unit | Has Mandate? | Output-Bearing? | Owns Planning Surface? | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Cell** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | 
| **Mission** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 
| **Project** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (across Missions) | 
| **Program** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (across Projects) | 
| **Campaign** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (across Programs) | 

> **Rule**: If a unit does not own **mandate + output + surface**, it is not autonomous, and thus not a structural unit.

This cleanly invalidates Cells as standalone units, while validating Missions upward.

## III. Assignment Logic -- Who Gets What and Why

You don't just create units. You assign them because **uncertainty exceeds the resolution capacity of the current layer**. That's the basis for new structure.

### 1. **Assign a Cell**

- Internal Mission bandwidth is exceeded
- Specific domain work requires tighter feedback loop (e.g., UI vs backend)
- Used to reduce cross-talk, not to plan work

→ Cell = _execution optimisation_, not coordination solution

### 2. **Assign a Mission**

- There's a discrete outcome
- More than one person needed
- Execution risk justifies separation from other work
- Needs Commander and FO

→ Mission = _risk container + output unit_

### 3. **Assign a Project**

- ≥ 2 Missions must produce **one public artefact** (internal or client)
- Stakeholders exist outside the executing team
- Time horizon exceeds a Mission, but execution must remain decomposed

→ Project = _work aggregation + interface layer_

### 4. **Assign a Program**

- Strategic objective spans several Projects
- KPI conflicts or resource tradeoffs must be resolved
- No single Project can satisfy the ambition alone

→ Program = _thematic integrator + KPI-level abstraction_

### 5. **Assign a Campaign**

- Strategic Council has created an ambition that can't be handled within one Program
- Budget, political or market consequences require coordination at the top
- Must anchor multiple Programs and resolve higher-order tradeoffs

→ Campaign = _strategic ambition handler_

* * *

## IV. Assignments Must Be Bounded

Each unit is assigned with:

- **Mandate**: the outcome it must enable
- **Timebox**: the outer boundary of its existence
- **Budget**: if applicable (can be soft/relative)
- **Escalation path**: where failure reports to

Without these, you're not assigning a unit--you're distributing confusion.

* * *

## V. Additional Clarification: Are There Any Other Unit Types?

Avoid introducing new units like "Initiatives", "Working Groups", "Sub-projects" unless they are explicitly **synonyms or aliases** of the above.

> **Only create new terms if they encode new authority boundaries.** Otherwise, map them to existing primitives.
* * *

## VI. Final Principles for Structural Clarity

1. **Do not promote structure without mandate.**  
If there's no formal responsibility, it's not a unit--it's overhead.

2. **Do not invent structure to manage personalities.**  
Units solve for complexity, not feelings or visibility.

3. **Do not fragment structure without throughput gains.**  
Every additional unit adds coordination cost. It must justify its drag.

4. **Create structure only to encapsulate irreducible risk, responsibility, or ambiguity.**

* * *

## Summary

- **Cells are tactical constructs**, not structural units.
- **All execution-bearing structure begins at the Mission level.**
- Assignment of units is a function of structural necessity, not managerial preference.
- **Mandate, output, and surface** are the irreducible qualifiers of any legitimate unit.

If your structure isn't eliminating uncertainty, it's just multiplying nouns.
