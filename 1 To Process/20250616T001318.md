Your question is imprecise. The sharper version would be:  
**"Is it structurally sound to store multiple projects in a monorepo, and if so, can access be segmented so users only see or interact with their assigned mission?"**

* * *

## I. Monorepo for Projects: Is It Rational?

**Yes--conditionally.** Storing all projects under one Git repository (`projects/`) is rational if:
- You prioritize:

    - **Atomic commits** across related missions

    - **Standardized folder scaffolds**

    - **Centralized project lineage**

    - **Simplified CI/CD workflows**
- You operate with:

    - <100 projects over time

    - Predictable folder structures

    - Automated branch discipline (i.e. each mission lives on its own branch)

This creates a **cohesive knowledge core** without the sprawl of one repo per initiative.

**Folder structure example:**
    
    
    projects/
    ├── P01-Retrofit/
    │   └── mission-M01-Apollo/
    │       └── MasterContent.md
    ├── P02-Expansion/
    │   └── mission-M02-Basilisk/
    │       └── assets/
    

Every `mission-Mxx` is executed on a **dedicated Git branch**, e.g. `mission/M02-Basilisk`.

* * *

## II. Access Control: Git Realities

**No**, Git (in its canonical form) **cannot restrict read access** to parts of a repo.
- If a user has access to a private repo, they see **all branches** and the full history.
- There is **no way to restrict access per folder or per branch** within a single repo.

Therefore, **branch-based mission isolation** supports operational discipline--not security isolation.
* * *

## III. Access Segmentation: Practical Paths

If you **must** restrict access to mission-specific files, you have two realistic options:

### Option 1: One Repo Per Mission

- Pro: strict access control
- Con: fragmentation, repo sprawl, CI overhead
- Viable only with <20 active missions or if IP segregation is legally necessary

### Option 2: Monorepo + External Access Interface
- Use GitHub/GitLab internally
- Expose mission folders to members via:

    - **Retool** (file picker/UI)

    - **Signed S3 URLs**

    - **Static site interface (readonly)**

This way, non-core members interact only with surfaced artefacts or dashboards, **not Git directly**.

* * *

## IV. Best Practice for Your Model

Given your structure (central Field Officer, Strategic Ops, and high-trust missions), the most rational route is:

- **Keep a monorepo (`projects/`)**
- Use **strict branch discipline** (`mission/Mxx-<codename>`)
- Only **core contributors have repo access**
- Expose mission artefacts via controlled UIs (Retool, Slack bots)
- Log all branch merges to `main` through signed commits + CI checks

This balances **centralization, flexibility, and containment** without overengineering for fractional access.
* * *

## Conclusion

- ✅ Monorepo is rational for cohesion, clarity, and automation.
- ❌ Git does not support per-branch or per-folder access restrictions.
- ✅ Segmented access should be implemented via **external interfaces**, not Git internals.
- ⚠️ If hard separation is required, use per-mission repos and accept the resulting complexity.
