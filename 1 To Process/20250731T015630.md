You should have asked: _"Extend the operational case mapping for each container, listing representative services, use cases, and boundary rules."_

Below is a **fully elaborated breakdown** of the eight-container architecture. Each includes concrete examples, usage policies, and rational inclusion criteria. This provides tactical clarity and reduces ambiguity in daily use.
* * *

### **1. AUTH-HIGH**

**Color:** Red  
**Role:** High-value, high-risk assets. Compromise has financial/legal consequences.  
**Rules:** Never cross-linked. Opened only with premeditated intent.  
**Examples:**

- Banking: HSBC, Revolut, Monzo, Chase
- Government portals: IRS, HMRC, NHS, tax services
- Identity: YubiKey dashboards, Apple ID, Google Account settings
- Investment platforms: Vanguard, Fidelity, IBKR, crypto wallets
- 2FA portals: Authy, TOTP syncs (if web-based)
- Medical records, insurance accounts

**Inclusion Criteria:** If its compromise grants identity theft, financial access, or legal leverage → AUTH-HIGH.
* * *

### **2. AUTH-MED**

**Color:** Orange  
**Role:** Authenticated professional systems; productivity but not custodial accounts.  
**Rules:** No casual browsing. Strict app boundaries.  
**Examples:**

- SaaS: Notion, Asana, Trello, Airtable
- Developer: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- Work mail portals (not general email)
- Docs/sheets: Google Drive (Work), Office 365
- Internal dashboards: Time tracking, company intranet
- Video conferencing: Zoom, Meet (Work)

**Inclusion Criteria:** Requires login, is tied to your professional identity, but doesn't manage direct financial or identity risk.
* * *

### **3. AUTH-LOW**

**Color:** Yellow  
**Role:** Personal logins with low breach cost  
**Rules:** Allowed cookie persistence. Casual use.  
**Examples:**

- Shopping: Amazon, eBay, Etsy, local e-commerce
- Forums: Stack Overflow, Reddit (if logged in)
- Subscriptions: Netflix, Spotify, Twitch
- Food delivery: Uber Eats, Deliveroo
- Booking: Airbnb, Booking.com
- Personal blogs with login access

**Inclusion Criteria:** Logged-in, but no meaningful access to sensitive personal or financial data. Breach = annoyance, not disaster.
* * *

### **4. COMMS**

**Color:** Green  
**Role:** Communication endpoints (most likely infection vectors)  
**Rules:** No link clicking unless cross-checked. Keep segregated.  
**Examples:**

- Email: Gmail, ProtonMail, Outlook
- Messaging: Signal Web, Telegram Web, WhatsApp Web
- Video: Google Meet (Personal), Zoom (non-work)
- Contact forms, feedback portals
- Any newsletter, calendar service with integrated comms

**Inclusion Criteria:** If it delivers inbound information from others → it belongs here.
* * *

### **5. SEARCH/RESEARCH**

**Color:** Blue  
**Role:** Ephemeral, unauthenticated, general browsing  
**Rules:** No login. No saved sessions. Used for exploring and reading.  
**Examples:**

- Search engines: DuckDuckGo, Startpage, Google (signed-out)
- Knowledge: Wikipedia, Stack Exchange, MDN
- News: Reuters, Bloomberg, FT (no login)
- Academia: JSTOR, arXiv, SSRN
- Public datasets, regulatory filings, blogs
- Corporate websites, product documentation

**Inclusion Criteria:** You're consuming, not participating. No credentials entered.
* * *

### **6. SURVEILLANCE-SINK**

**Color:** Purple  
**Role:** Tracking-heavy, adtech-integrated platforms  
**Rules:** No crossover links. No auth reuse outside.  
**Examples:**

- Social: X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok
- Video: YouTube (logged in), Vimeo (if social)
- Meta properties: Messenger, Threads
- Google services _when logged in personally_ (YouTube, News)
- Ad-heavy content platforms
- Anything with Facebook Pixel or Meta login

**Inclusion Criteria:** If it monetises your behaviour more than your payment -- it goes here.
* * *

### **7. NUKE**

**Color:** Pink  
**Role:** Disposable sandbox. Links of unknown origin.  
**Rules:** Auto-delete container or clear cookies per session.  
**Examples:**

- Shortlinks: bit.ly, t.co, mailchimp tracking URLs
- Unverified downloads
- Unknown websites found via email/social
- Free trial signups with burner email
- Anything you don't plan to visit twice

**Inclusion Criteria:** If you have no idea where it goes, or wouldn't mind if the tab vanished -- NUKE it.
* * *

### **8. NON-CONTAINER**

**Color:** Grey  
**Role:** Emergency override; legacy or incompatibility cases  
**Rules:** Disabled by default. Used only when container breaks functionality.  
**Examples:**

- Some OAuth login flows (that fail in containerised tabs)
- WebGL-heavy apps that fail inside container
- Banking portals with anti-container session policies
- Edge-case embedded payment workflows

**Inclusion Criteria:** Use only if container functionality _breaks critical path_ and you are aware of the implications.
* * *

### Final Operational Logic

- **Containers = Trust Boundaries.** They are not categories of use but compartments of risk.
- **Each container has its own failure domain.** If one gets compromised, it doesn't propagate.
- **No cross-container sessions.** One tab = one context. Close before switching.
- **Review quarterly.** Container assignment drift is a risk vector.

This taxonomy is lean, stable, and future-resilient. Eight total containers map cleanly onto the structure of your digital life without excess or omission.
