Your query could have been more precise: *How do Git branches work in terms of local folder structure, and are new folders created for different branches?*

In **Git**, branches do not create new folders within your local project directory. Instead, branches represent different **versions** of your project within the **same directory**. When you switch between branches, the files in your working directory are updated to reflect the **state of the branch** you're currently on, but the folder structure itself remains the same.

Here’s how this works:

### **1. Single Folder for All Branches**

Your local Git repository lives in a **single directory**. Inside this directory, there’s a hidden `.git` folder, which stores all the information about the branches, commits, and other metadata.

- **When you switch between branches**, Git updates the files in this directory to match the state of the branch you’ve checked out, but it doesn’t create new directories or separate folder structures for each branch.

For example:

```bash
/my-project/
  ├── components/
  ├── pages/
  ├── store/
  ├── nuxt.config.js
  ├── package.json
  └── .git/
```

No matter which branch you’re on, all files will remain inside this **single folder** (`/my-project/`). The files in the working directory are changed to reflect the branch’s state, but the folder structure doesn’t change.

### **2. Switching Between Branches**

When you switch branches using `git checkout`, Git will update the files in your working directory to reflect the **content of the branch** you're switching to:

```bash
git checkout feature/new-page
```

- When you switch to `feature/new-page`, Git will remove, update, or add files in your working directory to match what is committed in the `feature/new-page` branch.
- This happens in **the same directory**. No new folders or directories are created.

If you switch back to the `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

- Git will again update the files in your local directory to reflect the state of the `main` branch.
  
**Important**: If you have uncommitted changes when switching branches, Git may prevent the switch until you either commit or stash the changes, to avoid losing work.

### **3. Files in the Same Folder, Different Content per Branch**

Here’s a practical example to show how files can differ across branches but remain in the same folder structure:

#### On `main` Branch

```bash
/my-project/
  ├── components/
  │   └── Header.vue
  ├── pages/
  │   └── index.vue
  ├── nuxt.config.js
```

#### On `feature/new-page` Branch

When you switch to `feature/new-page`, Git might add new files related to that feature:

```bash
/my-project/
  ├── components/
  │   └── Header.vue
  ├── pages/
  │   ├── index.vue
  │   └── new-page.vue  # This file exists only in this branch
  ├── nuxt.config.js
```

In this case, the `new-page.vue` file only exists in the `feature/new-page` branch. If you switch back to `main`, that file will be removed from your working directory.

### **How Git Tracks Branches Internally**

- Git stores all the information about branches in the hidden `.git` folder. This includes **commits**, **branches**, and **history**.
  
- The `.git` folder is the core of the Git system, and it’s responsible for knowing how to update the working directory when you switch branches.

When you switch branches, Git doesn’t create a separate folder for the branch; it just changes the files in the current directory to match what’s in that branch’s commit history.

---

### **Summary**

- **No new folders** are created when you work with Git branches. The folder structure remains the same.
- **Switching branches** changes the content of the files in your working directory, but these changes happen in the same project folder.
- Git tracks branch information in the hidden `.git` directory and uses this to update your working directory when you switch branches.
