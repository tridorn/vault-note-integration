Illustrative ownership % (PlatformCo A at launch):

- Founders + ESOP: 60%
- Parent HoldCo: 40% (board control, protective rights)
* * *

✅ With this structure:

- You/family keep control & economic upside through Family HoldCo (+ foundation if dynasty).
- Parent HoldCo is the capital allocator and owner of IP.
- Portfolio Ops makes the system repeatable.
- Capital Arm is optional -- doesn't override HoldCo's primacy.
- IPO policy allows selective liquidity without losing control.

Would you like me to now mock up 2--3 example scenarios (e.g. Year 5 snapshot with one IPO'd sub, one private platform, and two adjacency bets) so you can see cash flows, ownership, and control in practice? That would make the bigger frame "real."
