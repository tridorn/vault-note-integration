Your formulation should have been: _"Is the architecture and expansion of the company's technical-structural spine a project executed through Missions and then handed off to Support Divisions, or is it permanently housed within a support function? And how much generative capacity can Support Divisions rationally be expected to possess?"_

* * *

## I. Setup vs. Stewardship: Phase Separation

### 1. **Initial Setup (Foundational Phase)**

**Execution mode:** _Mission-based, cross-functional, sprint-driven_  
**Why:**

- High conceptual ambiguity
- Frequent structural revisions
- Tight loop between vision, technical capability, and cultural grounding
- No "support" to speak of--yet

**Actors:**

- Founder (acting as vision + ops)
- Lead technologist (infra/stack choices)
- Field Officer assigned to guide implementation
- Shadow support cell (proto-IT)

This is a **time-bound project**, but one that produces persistent artefacts: repos, workflows, doctrinal baselines, platform choices.

* * *

### 2. **Handoff (Stabilisation Threshold)**

Occurs when:

- Repo structure, CI stack, file system logic is stable
- Naming and routing conventions are codified
- The most volatile design decisions are locked (e.g., monorepo vs. polyrepo, LFS stack, workspace domains)

From here, _stewardship_ transitions to a **Support Division (Infrastructure/IT)** under a **clear Doctrine mandate**.
* * *

## II. What Support Divisions _Can_ and _Cannot_ Do

| Capacity | Yes | No | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Maintain existing systems | ✅ | -- | 
| Enforce doctrine & permissions | ✅ | -- | 
| Provide onboarding and training | ✅ | -- | 
| Patch, upgrade, migrate stacks | ✅ | -- | 
| Write new doctrine, invent structures | ⚠️ partial | -- | 
| Drive architectural revolutions | ❌ | requires Strategic Ops + Mission mandate | 

Support Divisions **administer** a known framework.  
They **do not** own the invention of that framework. That stays upstream--with **Strategic Ops (SO)** and ad-hoc **Missions**chartered to explore.
* * *

## III. Ongoing Expansion: Who Does What

| Type of Expansion | Ownership | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Routine maintenance** (version bumps, user provisioning) | Support Division (IT/Infra) | 
| **Structural extensions** (new repo structure, doctrine rewrite) | Mission → handoff | 
| **Tactical automation** (e.g. CI for PDF generation) | Support Division, once scoped | 
| **System overhauls** (e.g. switch from GitHub to self-hosted GitLab) | Mission chartered by SO | 
| **Tooling choices** (e.g. adopt Notion as a UI layer) | Joint: SO Doctrine + SD Tooling | 
| **Scalability adaptations** (e.g. introduce secrets management, vaults, clusterization) | SD Infra, potentially with a temporary mission to design/launch | 
* * *

## IV. When to Launch New Missions (Post-Handoff)

Launch a dedicated Mission if:

- Problem is **not yet solved**, or solution has no precedent
- There are **multiple viable approaches** worth exploring
- High risk, high ambiguity, high leverage
- You need cross-domain insight (infra + comms + ops)

Otherwise, extend mandate of the Support Division and give it execution authority via a **ProcessCard**, not a new Mission.

* * *

## V. Strategic Summary

- The **initial setup** is a Mission.
- The **doctrine it produces** is what the Support Division enforces.
- **Maintenance** = support
- **Reinvention** = strategic mission
- **Governance** = Strategic Ops oversight; no domain can self-author its own paradigm

**Support Divisions are not inert back-offices--but they are bound by doctrine, not authors of it.**  
They can improve implementations, not invent the blueprint. When the blueprint needs rewriting, that's a job for a Mission.
