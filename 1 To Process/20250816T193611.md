Great question. Here's a clean blueprint for bringing in external capital and investing in other companies without breaking your "build real operating value" thesis.

  

# 1) External money

# into

#  your machine

  

## A. Permanent equity at

## HoldCo

##  (evergreen)

  

Use when: you want patient, aligned capital and maximum strategic freedom.

Who: family offices, entrepreneurs, a few long-horizon institutions.

Terms to aim for:

- Ordinary equity (avoid stacked liquidation prefs that force premature exits).
- Control preserved via shareholder agreement or dual-class (board majority, protective provisions; not heavy-handed).
- Liquidity program: annual/biannual tender offers + opportunistic buybacks funded by HoldCo FCF (not promises of fixed redemptions).
- Disclosure cadence: quarterly ops KPIs + semiannual capital allocation letters; one independent director.

  

Pros: true permanence, lower agency risk.

Cons: early valuation sensitivity; investors need comfort with illiquidity--solve via buyback policy and crisp reporting.

  

## B.

## HoldCo debt

##  (RCF + term loan)

  

Use when: funding bolt-ons or bridging to cash inflows.

- Covenants: interest coverage + dividend-to-HoldCo tests, not growth KPIs.
- Security: HoldCo shares/CF streams (avoid opco blanket liens if possible).
- Guardrails: keep HoldCo net debt/FCF < 2.0× until the flywheel is very reliable.

  

## C.

## Sidecar / Co-invest fund

##  (optional, small)

  

Use when: an opco round or acquisition is larger than HoldCo wants to swallow.

- Structure: closed-end SPV or a tiny fund (e.g., 1%/10% fees-carry, not 2/20).
- Conflict policy (write it down): HoldCo has first look; if deal size > HoldCo bite, the excess goes to sidecar pro-rata; identical terms; independent IC member.

  

## D.

## OpCo-level capital

- Venture debt / RBF for high-gross-margin, predictable revenue newcos (reduces dilution).
- Minority growth equity at opco only when it accelerates distribution or M&A without losing strategic control (use protective provisions).
* * *

# 2) Your machine investing

# outward

#  in other companies

  

Design three lanes and stick to them:

  

## Lane 1 --

## Control acquisitions

##  (PlatformCos)

- Target: majority stake (>50%) where your shared services lift margins (buy-and-build, roll-ups, carve-outs).
- Tooling: cash + modest debt, earn-outs tied to handover quality, 100-day integration plan into Portfolio Ops.
- Governance: board control, cash sweep policy (dividend upstream unless reinvestment > hurdle).

  

## Lane 2 --

## Significant minority (15--49%) with hard rights

##  (AdjacencyCos)

- Why: strategic adjacency, option to control later.
- Instruments: preferred or common + board seat, information rights, ROFR/ROFO, protective provisions (new debt, M&A, budget), call option to majority at pre-agreed formula or upon trigger (missed KPIs, change of control).
- Ratchets: performance step-ups (extra equity if revenue/EBITDA targets missed).

  

## Lane 3 --

## Small, option-like positions (<15%)

##  (rare)

- Only if you get warrants or most-favored-nation terms plus true strategic intel or distribution rights. Otherwise skip--doesn't fit the control/operating thesis.
* * *

# 3) Instruments & terms that preserve your edge

- Call options & contingent step-ups to move from minority → control when it matters.
- Earn-outs to bridge valuation gaps without overpaying day-one.
- Non-compete & data-sharing clauses (data warehoused at HoldCo; opcos get licensed access).
- IP at HoldCo, licensed to opcos so know-how stays central even if you sell an asset.
- Service Level Agreements between Portfolio Ops and opcos (pricing, KPIs, termination rights).
* * *

# 4) Capital allocation rules (simple, mechanical)

- Hurdles:

    - Control buys: ≥15% unlevered IRR with clear synergy path to 25%+.

    - New studio builds: 2.5--3.0× MOIC potential in 5--7 years; kill quickly if miss gates.

    - Significant minorities: path to control or superior cash yield; otherwise pass.
- 70/20/10 split:

    - 70% to winners (follow-ons, bolt-ons).

    - 20% to new studio builds.

    - 10% opportunistic (distressed tuck-ins, carve-outs).
- Leverage guardrails: opco net debt/EBITDA ≤ 2.5× early; HoldCo ≤ 2.0× FCF.
* * *

# 5) Governance & conflicts (codify upfront)

- Allocation policy: HoldCo keeps control-fit deals on balance sheet; sidecar only supplements ticket size.
- Pricing fairness: identical securities for HoldCo and sidecar; if not, disclose rationale and get independent sign-off.
- Information walls: sidecar LP reports exclude competitively sensitive cross-opco data.
- Founder/management LTIPs: paid on realized value creation vs. capital at work, not paper marks.
* * *

# 6) Liquidity design for external investors

- HoldCo: periodic buybacks/tenders, special dividends on large partial exits, optional DRIP.
- Sidecar/SPVs: classic private equity waterfall (e.g., 8% pref → catch-up → 10--15% carry).
- OpCo minorities: built-in put/call windows (years 3--5, formula tied to EBITDA or revenue with caps/floors).
* * *

# 7) Example flow (numbers, simplified)

- HoldCo raises €40m permanent equity + €10m RCF.
- Year 1--2:

    - Launch 3 studio newcos (€1.5m each = €4.5m).

    - Buy a control asset for €18m EV (2.5× EBITDA €7.2m with under-earning) using €12m equity + €6m opco debt.

    - Take 25% in an adjacency for €6m with a 3-year call to 51% at 8× EBITDA if targets hit.
- By Year 3: platform throws €4m FCF/yr; HoldCo tenders €2m of shares and funds 2 bolt-ons; sidecar co-invests €8m into a larger follow-on while HoldCo keeps control.
* * *

# 8) When to

# not

#  take external money

- If the only terms available come with stacked prefs or vetoes that force exits on a clock.
- If the capital pushes you into fee-first behavior (big fund that must be deployed regardless of fit).
- If it compromises the IP-at-HoldCo principle.
* * *

# 9) Minimal docs/playbooks to prepare

1. Capital Allocation Policy (hurdles, 70/20/10, leverage).

2. Deal Allocation & Conflict Policy (HoldCo vs sidecar).

3. Integration Playbook & SLA (what plugs into Portfolio Ops, by when).

4. Minority-to-Control Toolkit (call options, triggers, ratchets).

5. Investor Comms Cadence (metrics, letters, buyback framework).

* * *

### Bottom line

- Raise permanent equity at HoldCo + light debt for flexibility.
- Use a small sidecar only to scale tickets while keeping control.
- Invest outward primarily in control or hard-rights minorities with a path to control.
- Bake in liquidity programs and conflict policies early so you never have to choose between your operating edge and your investors.

  

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page "Capital Structure & Deal Policy" and a simple spreadsheet model you can tweak for ticket sizes, FCF, and buyback cadence.
