Correction: You should have stated: “Now that SSH is configured and I’ve transitioned from GitHub Desktop to a CLI environment on Fedora Silverblue, what is the correct Git workflow for managing and syncing my Obsidian vault?”

⸻

Your Git Workflow Now (CLI-Based, Toolbox-Hosted)

Your setup:
	•	Repo location: ~/Documents/ObsidianVault
	•	Working environment: Toolbox container
	•	Authentication: SSH keypair bound to GitHub
	•	Editor: Obsidian (Flatpak), modifies local files
	•	Version control: Git via CLI

⸻

Key Principle

You edit notes with Obsidian. You commit and sync changes from within Toolbox using Git commands. That’s the separation.

⸻

Daily Workflow: Minimal Git Command Set

1. Start Session

toolbox enter
cd ~/Documents/ObsidianVault


⸻

2. Pull Any Upstream Changes

In case you’ve updated the vault from another device:

git pull

This ensures you work on the latest state. Always run this before editing, or you’ll create unnecessary conflicts.

⸻

3. Edit Vault (via Obsidian)

Run Obsidian from the host system:

flatpak run md.obsidian.Obsidian

Make your changes.

⸻

4. Stage, Commit, Push

Once you’re done editing:

git status             # See what's changed
git add .              # Stage all changes (or target specific files)
git commit -m "Note updates - YYYY-MM-DD"
git push               # Syncs to GitHub

You’ve now versioned and synced your notes.

⸻

Optional: Setup Git Defaults (Once)

Inside Toolbox:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

This eliminates identity prompts.

⸻

Optional: Check Remote Info

To confirm you’re using SSH:

git remote -v

Output should look like:

origin  git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepo.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepo.git (push)

If it shows HTTPS, switch:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepo.git


⸻

Optional: View Commit History

git log --oneline

See recent commits quickly.

⸻

Optional: Undo a Mistake

git restore filename.md         # Discard changes in one file
git reset --soft HEAD~1         # Undo last commit, keep changes


⸻

Summary – Your New CLI Workflow

Action	Command
Enter environment	toolbox enter
Navigate to repo	cd ~/Documents/ObsidianVault
Pull changes	git pull
Stage changes	git add .
Commit	git commit -m "..."
Push	git push
Sync complete	✅

You’re not managing GitHub. You’re managing files. Git tracks them, and GitHub is just the remote sync point.

Once internalised, this workflow is faster, more precise, and versionable at will.
