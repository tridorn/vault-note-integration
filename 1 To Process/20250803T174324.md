Correction: Instead of "Could you give me a transition (/setup) guide?" and "should I delete (rather, replace) Windows outright?" a more executive formulation would be: "I require a concrete transition and setup framework. Should I overwrite Windows entirely, given I have multiple drives?"

* * *

### OVERVIEW

  

You are initiating a platform re-baselining. The goal is not exploratory compatibility but full deprecation of Windows and onboarding to a new operational paradigm. This demands a clean system architecture, no fallback crutches, and controlled knowledge acquisition.

* * *

## I. STRATEGIC TRANSITION ARCHITECTURE

  

### 1.

### Immediate Objectives

- Single, clean Linux host OS.
- Isolated data partitions with backup.
- Functional parity for all critical tasks (work, media, networking, etc.).
- No dependency on Windows or dual-boot.

  

### 2.

### Recommended Stack

- Host OS: Fedora Silverblue
- Container Layer: toolbox (for mutable development environments)
- Flatpak: Primary GUI app layer
- Btrfs: For snapshotting and rollback (built-in on Silverblue)
- Drive Usage:

    - Drive 1: OS

    - Drive 2: /home, user data, and persistent volumes

    - Drive 3 (optional): Archive or cold storage, encrypted if needed
* * *

## II. INSTALLATION AND PARTITIONING LOGIC

  

### 1.

### Data Preservation Phase

- Backup everything critical off the Windows system.
- Inventory any proprietary or workflow-critical software.
- Identify Linux-native or container-based replacements now, not later.

  

### 2.

### Windows Deletion Decision

  

Yes--delete Windows entirely if:

- You're committed to zero dual-platform overhead.
- You've already mapped Linux replacements for all critical software.
- You control your own hardware stack (no vendor lock-in or drivers needed from Windows-only OEMs).

  

Otherwise, relegate it to a separate drive, powered off or disconnected during Linux setup.

  

### 3.

### Drive Layout Strategy

  

| Drive  | Mount Point   | Role       | File System        | Notes                                                      |
|--------|---------------|------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| nvme0  | /             | OS         | Btrfs               | Silverblue root, managed via rpm-ostree                    |
| sda    | /home         | User data  | Btrfs or ext4       | Separate volume for persistence, encryption optional       |
| sdb    | /mnt/archive  | Optional   | ext4 or encrypted   | For mass storage, archival, etc.                           |

**Note:** Ensure `/boot/efi` is created during setup on Drive 1. Use custom partitioning in the Anaconda installer.


* * *

## III. POST-INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

  

### 1.

### Immediate System Actions

- rpm-ostree update
- Set up toolbox: toolbox create dev
- Add Flatpak remotes: flathub, enable system-wide
- Install base GUI apps: terminal, browser, file manager, password manager
- Install CLI tools into toolbox: dnf, git, vim, neovim, etc.

  

### 2.

### Workflow Replication

- Port dotfiles and configuration
- Mount secondary drives in /etc/fstab for persistence
- Setup SSH keys, GPG, VPN
- Validate peripheral compatibility (printer, scanner, webcam, GPU)

  

### 3.

### Snapshots & Recovery

- Silverblue's Btrfs layer enables rollback
- Use rpm-ostree status to track deployments
- ostree admin rollback if a system update breaks
* * *

## IV. WHAT TO EXPECT (AND CONTROL FOR)

  

### 1.

### Impedance Mismatch

  

Expect a 10--15 day friction window as muscle memory and UX expectations reset. Force adaptation. Do not fall back to Windows, even temporarily.

  

### 2.

### Hardware/Driver Edge Cases

- GPU (especially Nvidia) will require proprietary driver via RPMFusion
- Touchpads, Wi-Fi adapters, or Bluetooth may need firmware blobs
- Sound config (PipeWire) can require tuning

  

### 3.

### Packaging Shift

- You no longer "install everything" into the host.
- Think host = minimal immutable base
- Apps via Flatpak
- Dev tools via toolbox
- No dnf install directly unless absolutely necessary
* * *

## V. ENDGAME: TRANSITION TO NIXOS

  

Once stabilized in Silverblue (3--6 months):

- Begin learning Nix via nix CLI on Silverblue
- Use home-manager for reproducible dotfiles
- Build basic configuration.nix templates for hardware
- Transition to full NixOS when you can replicate your working system via a single config file
* * *

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

  

Yes, erase Windows completely. Partition cleanly across drives. Begin directly with Silverblue. Eliminate fallback crutches. Adopt the new model early: immutability, containerisation, reproducibility. Within 6 months, phase into NixOS.

  

If this is to be a true switch, treat it like one: all-in, no exit plan.
