 The AMU leader isnâ€™t a fixed person, it is a role. A role that people inside of the AMU rotate in and out of (for example a Mission Planner holds the role in the beginning)
- Mission planners are essential in the beginning of an AMU, translating the mission, setting sprint cycles and milestones. Afterwards they can be assigned to a different AMU if needed
- Mission planners are prime material for SO posts, as bringing experience with them how AMUs operate
