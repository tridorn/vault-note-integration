Your question could have been phrased with greater precision to reflect the cultural, historical, and aesthetic dimensions of tuberculosis' romanticization, particularly in relation to the intellectual and artistic classes. A more refined formulation would be:  

**"Why was tuberculosis historically romanticized, especially in connection with the intelligentsia and artistic circles?"**  

### **The Romanticization of Tuberculosis: Aesthetic, Cultural, and Intellectual Dimensions**  

The romanticization of tuberculosis (TB), particularly as a characteristic of the intelligentsia and artistic elite, was a complex cultural phenomenon that emerged from medical ignorance, aesthetic ideals, and social stratification. Several key factors contributed to this mythologization:

#### **1. The Aesthetic of the Wasting Body**
During the 18th and 19th centuries, tuberculosis (often called "consumption") was associated with a delicate, ethereal beauty. The disease caused pallor, a thin frame, and flushed cheeks—features that conformed to the Romantic and later Victorian ideals of beauty. In a world where corpulence was often linked to excess and vulgarity, the appearance of the consumptive was paradoxically seen as pure, refined, and spiritually elevated.

#### **2. Association with Genius and Sensitivity**
Tuberculosis was disproportionately prevalent among impoverished but intellectually active city dwellers, including poets, writers, and musicians who lived in poor conditions. This led to the perception that the disease struck those of a melancholic and artistic temperament. The belief that tuberculosis heightened artistic genius and sensitivity contributed to the romantic myth of the suffering intellectual.

Prominent artists and writers who died of tuberculosis include:
- **John Keats** (poet)
- **Frédéric Chopin** (composer)
- **Giacomo Puccini** (composer, though he likely had throat cancer)
- **Anton Chekhov** (playwright)
- **Franz Kafka** (writer)

Their slow decline was interpreted not as a tragic medical fate, but as an almost poetic sacrifice—consumption of the body mirroring the consumption of the soul by art and passion.

#### **3. Tuberculosis as a "Spiritual" Disease**
Unlike cholera or syphilis, which were associated with filth and immorality, tuberculosis was seen as a disease of refinement. The slow progression of TB allowed sufferers to remain lucid and articulate until their deaths, reinforcing the idea that their intellectual and creative output was intensified in their final days. The myth of the "beautiful death"—a quiet, dignified fading—was far removed from the grotesque realities of other diseases.

#### **4. Literary and Operatic Glorification**
Tuberculosis was immortalized in literature, theater, and opera, further entrenching its association with beauty and tragedy:
- **Alexandre Dumas fils' *La Dame aux Camélias*** (1848) – The story of the doomed courtesan Marguerite Gautier, who dies of TB, was adapted into **Verdi’s *La Traviata***.
- **Goethe’s *The Sorrows of Young Werther*** (1774) – Though not explicitly about TB, it contributed to the idea of tragic, consumptive suffering.
- **Victor Hugo's *Les Misérables*** (1862) – Fantine’s decline due to illness, likely TB, is portrayed with sorrow and beauty.
- **Thomas Mann’s *The Magic Mountain*** (1924) – A philosophical meditation on tuberculosis as a state of heightened awareness and detachment from the mundane world.

#### **5. The Myth of the "Good Death"**
Unlike sudden, violent diseases, tuberculosis had a long, languorous trajectory. This allowed for the idea of a "good death," where the dying could contemplate existence, arrange their affairs, and impart final words of wisdom. The protracted suffering was likened to a martyrdom of sorts, aligning with Christian ideals of patience and redemption through suffering.

#### **6. Economic and Social Class Associations**
In the 19th century, tuberculosis affected both the impoverished and the bourgeoisie. However, while the lower classes were seen as victims of squalor and disease, the upper classes reframed tuberculosis as a disease of delicate refinement. The perception of the "doomed artist" or "fragile intellectual" allowed the middle and upper classes to distance themselves from the epidemic’s broader devastation.

### **The End of the Romantic Ideal**
The romanticization of tuberculosis began to wane in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as scientific understanding advanced. With the discovery of the **Mycobacterium tuberculosis** bacterium by Robert Koch in 1882, TB was reclassified as a contagious disease rather than a mark of genius. Public health campaigns stripped it of its aesthetic allure, and sanatoriums replaced drawing-room deathbeds.

By the mid-20th century, tuberculosis became associated with poverty and urban squalor, losing its once-privileged cultural cachet. Today, its historical romanticization is viewed as a morbid relic of pre-modern medical misconceptions.

### **Conclusion**
The glorification of tuberculosis was a convergence of aesthetics, literature, and social hierarchy. It embodied the Romantic and Victorian preoccupation with suffering as a source of artistic and moral transcendence. In hindsight, this perception seems naive, given the horrific reality of the disease, but it reveals the human tendency to aestheticize and intellectualize suffering to make it more palatable—especially when it afflicts the artistic elite.
