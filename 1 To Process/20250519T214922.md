Understood. You don't need to be a developer. You need to **own the interface to clients** and **control the output**. Execution in your case means orchestrating, not coding.

Here's how you handle web development with no dev experience--**while keeping full control and margin**.

* * *

## I. MODEL: "White-Label Studio" Structure

You are not a developer. You are a **studio lead** with:
- A front-facing identity (Adrian Straven, Eupator)
- A curated backend team (freelance or agency) to execute
- A tight system of briefs, templates, and reviews

You make money from **project margin**, not your labor.

* * *

## II. ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES SPLIT

| Task | Your Role | Developer's Role | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Sales & client comms | You | -- | 
| Scope & pricing | You | -- | 
| Brief creation | You | -- | 
| Design feedback | You | -- | 
| Development | -- | 100% | 
| QA + corrections | You | -- (unless bugs) | 
| Delivery & handoff | You | -- | 
* * *

## III. STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION FLOW

### **1. Build a Backend Pool (1 Week)**

Use:

- Upwork
- Fiverr
- Toptal (for higher-end)
- Telegram dev groups (e.g. "Framer Developers", "Astro Web")

Search terms:

- "Framer developer"
- "Astro website build"
- "Tailwind landing page"

**Screen for**:

- Portfolio relevance (startup sites, clean work)
- Responsiveness
- Comfort with fixed pricing

Have 2--3 ready to go. Pay per project, not hourly.

* * *

### **2. Package the Offer (2--3 Packages)**

Example:

- **Basic Site**: €700

    - Landing page, up to 3 sections
- **Startup Site**: €1,500

    - Home, product, about, contact
- **Conversion Bundle**: €2,500

    - Full site + copywriting + analytics setup
* * *

### **3. Handle a Real Client (or Mock One)**

**Sales flow**:

- Discovery call (30 mins)
- Send intake form (Typeform or Google Form)
- Scope defined: Number of pages, style, examples
- Send fixed quote, payment link (Stripe or PayPal)

**Then**:

1. Draft internal **brief doc** (Figma link, structure, goals)

2. Send it to your dev (Google Docs + Loom voiceover works)

3. They build in Framer, Astro, or your stack of choice

4. You review + QA (check for alignment, responsiveness)

5. Get feedback from client

6. Final fix round

7. Handoff with Loom + access instructions
* * *

### **4. Systematise After First Delivery**

After a few runs:

- Create **reusable briefs**
- Build **email templates** for each phase (intro, delivery, feedback)
- Create a **client folder template**
- Maintain a **freelancer sheet** (skills, rates, availability)
* * *

## IV. TOOL STACK TO RUN THIS

| Purpose | Tool | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Client comms | Gmail + Notion CRM | 
| Briefing | Google Docs + Loom | 
| Payment | Stripe or PayPal | 
| Storage | Google Drive | 
| Project tracking | Notion or Trello | 
| Feedback | MarkUp.io or Figma comments | 
| Intake | Typeform or Tally | 
| Dev platform | Framer, Astro, Webflow (you don't touch code) | 

* * *

## V. MINIMUM VIABLE EXAMPLE (First Client)

- Offer: Startup Landing Page, €700
- Find dev who builds Framer pages for €250
- You manage client and do QA
- You pocket €450 gross, deliver in 7 days
- Result: Portfolio piece + reusable system
* * *

**Core Insight**:  
You are not a coder. You're a **delivery architect**--you manage **clarity, quality, and communication**. Execution is about managing interfaces: the one with the client, and the one with the executor. Everything in between is replaceable.

Once you've done this 3--5 times, you'll have a playbook that can scale.
