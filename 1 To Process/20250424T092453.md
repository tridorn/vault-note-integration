### Executive Decision Grid — *Where each idea lives while you remain German-resident*

| Venture class | Early-phase legal wrapper **now** (2025-27) | Threshold to **migrate** into Eupator-UG | Rationale |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|
| **1 Side Hustles** (e-books, Notion templates, affiliate micro-sites) | **Sole trader (“Einzelunternehmer”)** under the *Klein­unternehmer­regelung* if annual turnover ≤ € 25 000 (§ 19 UStG) citeturn0search0 | • Cumulative turnover > € 50 000 **or**<br>• Any personal-liability risk appears | Zero fixed cost; no payroll tax; simplest bookkeeping (EÜR); VAT-free invoices to B2C EU customers until the limit is breached. |
| **2 Service Businesses / Agencies** (design studio, marketing agency) | **Eupator-UG** operating division (no separate entity yet) | • Two external freelancers on retainer **or**<br>• Annual gross margin > € 150 000 | Clients value a limited-liability counterparty; bigger invoices need VAT & creditworthiness. |
| **3 Scalable Start-ups** (SaaS, deep tech) | **Project code-name inside Eupator-UG**; cap-table kept blank | • External equity investor term-sheet **or**<br>• Monthly recurring revenue > € 10 k | You conserve equity until proof-of-concept; spin-out into new GmbH or foreign entity when funding arrives. |

*Result*: one **personal tax stream** for tiny cash-flows, one **corporate stream** (Eupator-UG) that can absorb and later spin-out anything that shows traction.

## 1 Structuring **Eupator-UG** for multi-venture incubation

### 1.1 Internal “cell” architecture  

```
                 Eupator-UG  (holding + shared services)
                          │
     ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
     │              │              │              │
 [CELL-S]       [CELL-A]       [CELL-X]       [CELL-Z]
 Side-hustle    Agency         Startup 1      Startup 2
 bookkeeping    P&L            MVP budget     R&D budget
```

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **CELL-S** | Records royalty inflows from your personal side-hustle IP (licence agreement, 6 % of net sales, arm’s-length). |
| **CELL-A** | Houses service contracts, employs staff/freelancers, invoices clients. |
| **CELL-X / Z** | Dedicated cost-centres with their own Trello/Notion board, monthly burn reports, IP docket. |

Shared services (bookkeeping, legal templates, marketing stack) live in the **holding layer**; each cell is an *analytic ledger category*, **not a separate company**—cheap, but gives you clarity.

### 1.2 Chart of accounts you actually need  

| G/L block | Key accounts |
|-----------|--------------|
| **4000-4099** Revenue – Side hustles |
| **4100-4199** Revenue – Agency |
| **4200-4299** Revenue – Startup prototypes (pilot users) |
| **5000-5099** COGS / freelancers |
| **6000-6099** Marketing & SaaS subscriptions |
| **7000-7099** R&D / software licences |
| **8000-8099** Management salary / board fees |

Lexoffice or Datev Unternehmen-online can map this in 30 min.

## 2 Governance cadence for a first-time founder

| Rhythm | Meeting | Minimum agenda |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Weekly (30 min)** | *Ops huddle* with yourself | KPIs per cell, cash on hand, micro-tasks committed. |
| **Monthly (1 h)** | *Director meeting* (formal board minutes) | • Approve previous month P&L per cell<br>• Decide budget reallocations<br>• Check reserve build-up (25 % rule) |
| **Quarterly (2 h)** | *Strategic council* | • Kill / continue decisions on each cell (use RICE or ICE scoring)<br>• Update valuation memo & exit-tax file |
| **Annual (half-day)** | *Shareholders’ meeting* | Approve accounts, dividend vs. reinvest decision, amendments to Satzung if needed. |

## 3 How each venture graduates to its own entity

| Graduation trigger | Spin-out mechanics | Preferred jurisdiction *while German-resident* |
|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Side hustle hits € 50 k annual profit** | Transfer licence to Eupator-UG (already done) and keep inside | No new entity; tax friction minimal. |
| **Agency hires ≥ 3 employees OR signs contract ≥ € 100 k** | Create **Eupator Services GmbH** (subsidiary) to ring-fence liability | Germany (client comfort + payroll). |
| **Startup raises external equity** | • Incorporate **Eupator Tech GmbH**<br>• Issue new shares to VC, keep 80 % at holding | Germany now; can redomicile post-exit. |
| **Startup goes global & you relocate (2028)** | Cross-border convert Tech GmbH ➔ UAE free-zone Ltd; cap-table untouched | UAE ADGM / DMCC; investors keep same shares. |

---

## 4 Personal vs. corporate income: tax optics

| Flow | Immediate tax while in Germany |
|------|--------------------------------|
| Royalty you collect personally from Cell-S licence | Einkommensteuer at your marginal rate; but deduct expenses easily; VAT-free up to € 25 k (Kleinunternehmer). |
| Salary from Eupator-UG | Payroll tax; deductible expense to UG. |
| Dividends from UG to you | 26.375 % KapESt withholding. |
| Dividends UG ➔ Holding-UG (if you add it) | **95 % exemption** (§ 8b KStG) so effective ~1.5 % tax citeturn2search0; Gewerbesteuer also 95 % cut if ≥ 15 % share (§ 9 Nr 2a GewStG) citeturn3search2. |

Hence: keep personal cash-flows tiny; reinject most earnings into UG or Swiss custody until you relocate.

## 5 Zero-cost operating stack (for a solo founder)

| Function | Tool | Cost/mo | Why this one |
|----------|------|---------|--------------|
| Bookkeeping | **Lexoffice** | €16 | German GoBD-ready; DATEV export for tax adviser. |
| Payment processing | **Stripe + Wise** | Pay-as-you-go | Multi-currency, low FX to CHF for Swiss deposits. |
| Project mgmt | **Notion** | €8 | Quick to template per cell; syncs with side-hustle sales. |
| Time tracking | **Toggle** | Free | Attach cost to each cell for later margin analysis. |
| Contract e-sign | **Eversign** | Free tier | Valid in EU; attach to board minutes. |

## 6 Immediate action list (next 14 days)

1. **Draft bespoke Satzung** with migration clause; book notary.  
2. **Register Gewerbe** for personal side-hustles under Kleinunternehmer-regelung.  
3. **Set up Lexoffice**; create the four revenue cost-centres (4000, 4100, 4200, 4300).  
4. **Sign IP licence** (you ➔ UG) at 6 % net sales.  
5. **Book first board meeting** template; minute the launch of CELL-S and CELL-A.  
6. **Open Wise + Stripe**; connect to Notion template store.  
7. Calendar-invite yourself to **monthly board sessions**; lock slot for the year.

Execute these, and Eupator will be a *living corporate lab*: low-cost, audit-proof, and ready to fork successful ventures into their own legally and fiscally optimised shells whenever they deserve it.
