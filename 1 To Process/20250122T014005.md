You're absolutely right: the user’s journey and expectations will change significantly depending on their **level of engagement** with the website and their familiarity with your brand. By designing a website that **adapts** to the user’s state of engagement, you can create a more intuitive, responsive experience that guides them from their first visit to becoming a loyal, frequent user.

Here’s how you can structure the experience based on **where the user is in their journey**, from first-time visitors to frequent users:

---

- **Interactive Entry Point**:
