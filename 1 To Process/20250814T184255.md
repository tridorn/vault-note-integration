Better: "Show me exactly how to read and work with a book using the workbook-as-control-plane system. Give a timeboxed protocol with decision gates, concrete outputs, and minimal admin."

  

Here is a lean, repeatable method tuned to your 3.5-day cadence.

  

# Objective

  

Extract decision-grade principles and executable plays, not summaries. The book is raw material; your outputs are atomic notes, a decision or two, one micro-experiment, and links into your maps.

  

# Protocol (3.5 days per book)

  

## T-12 to 0 hours -- Pre-commit triage (15--20 minutes)

  

Purpose: avoid low-yield reads.

1. Scan TOC, index, introduction, conclusion, and two random pages.

2. Workbook thread:
    
    
    [REF] 25227-01  Book triage: Dunford, Obviously Awesome
    Context: Evaluate ROI of full read.
    Signal: TOC coherent; index shows "alternatives, attributes, proof"; pages 34, 86 dense.
    Implication: High signal for positioning decisions.
    Next: Commit; define kill criteria at 20% mark.

3. Set kill rule: abort at 20 percent progress if you cannot form two strong cards that point to an immediate play.

  

## Day 1 -- Surface map and capture (2--3 hours reading, 30--45 minutes sweep)

  

Aim: wide pass, disciplined capture, no perfection.

1. Before reading, open a WIP thread with focus and kill rule.

2. Read quickly. Create 30--60 index-card captures across chapters. One idea per card. Use corner marks for type and short IDs YYDOY-SS (e.g., 25227-03).

3. Keep a strict per-chapter cap of ten cards. Force selectivity.

4. If kill rule trips at ~20 percent, stop. Workbook entry:
    
    
    [DEC] 25227-05  Kill read at 22% (low yield)
    Context: No actionable plays; claims generic.
    Decision: Stop; park source with brief synthesis.
    Next: Return later only if a project requires it.

5. End-of-day sweep: photograph all keepers to /_inbox; promote 8--12 best cards to "distil tomorrow".

  

## Day 2 AM -- Distil to atomic notes (60--90 minutes)

  

Convert analogue to digital leverage.

1. Choose the top ten cards for this book.

2. For each, write one markdown note using the atomic template (statement, evidence, implication, action) and a full timestamp ID.

3. Link each note to one map and one project. If you cannot link, demote it.

    id: 2025-08-15T0934-principle-positioning-alternatives
    type: principle
    title: Start positioning from real alternatives
    source: src-book-dunford-2019-obviously-awesome
    source_loc: p33--41
    tags: [positioning, segmentation]
    status: linked
    ---
    
    Statement
    Positioning emerges from what customers would use absent you.
    
    Evidence
    Case examples show loss of clarity when teams start from features.
    
    Implication
    Inventory true alternatives before value attributes.
    
    Action
    Run 30-minute "alternatives audit" with three recent prospects this week.

## Day 2 PM -- Synthesis and routing (45--60 minutes)

  

Bind the material into your system.

1. Source dossier update: 150--200 words on the thesis and scope of use; list high-signal pages; link the ten notes.

2. Workbook threads for active decisions or experiments the book suggests. Example:
    
    
    [EXP] 25228-02  Positioning interview script v1
    Context: Need to validate alternatives and triggers.
    Signal: Book prescribes attribute mapping post-alternatives.
    Implication: Script interviews this week.
    Next: Create EXP record; schedule three calls; link notes P-IDs.

3. Push any TASK threads to your task manager with the short ID in the title.

  

## Day 3 -- Application (90--120 minutes execution, 20 minutes logging)

  

Convert reading into a live test.

1. Choose one Play or Experiment derived from the book.

2. Create an experiment file with hypothesis, metrics, guardrails, design, sample, dates.

3. Execute a minimal version the same day or schedule concrete steps.

4. Log outcomes, even partial. Link back to the decision thread.

  

## Half-day buffer -- Close and prune (30--45 minutes)

  

Finish cleanly to prevent drift.

1. Write a 200-word synthesis into the source dossier: where this source is strong, where it fails, and when to reuse.

2. Cull three weak notes or merge duplicates.

3. Move one or two high-leverage notes into the Leitner review set.

4. Set a 30-day review date for any decisions created from the book.

  

# What to capture vs ignore

  

Capture when at least two of three are true:

- It changes a near-term decision.
- It specifies a testable behavior, metric, or threshold.
- It contradicts a prior principle you hold.

  

Ignore:

- Generic exhortations without falsifiable content.
- Stories whose only value is color.
- Definitions you already operationalised elsewhere.

  

# Workbook grammar in practice

  

Keep the console terse. Every thread routes.

- REF threads start the book and set kill criteria.
- DEC threads commit, reverse, or time-box an approach pulled from the book.
- EXP threads instantiate a play into a test with guardrails.
- LOG threads record measurable outcomes.
- TASK threads move execution to your task system.

  

Example sequence
    
    
    [REF] 25227-01  Book triage …
    [DEC] 25227-02  Commit read; kill at 20% if no plays …
    [EXP] 25228-02  Positioning interview script v1 …
    [TASK] 25228-03  Book 3 interviews, Wed--Fri …
    [LOG] 25229-01  2/3 interviews confirm alternatives set A,B; attribute X irrelevant …

# Genre adaptations (same framework, different emphasis)

- Handbooks and playbooks: skim TOC and checklists; capture Plays and Metrics; deprioritise narrative.
- Theory or frameworks: capture Principles and Counterexamples; delay Plays until validated by your context.
- Case collections: capture Patterns and Risks; synthesize across cases into one or two Principles.
- Dense academic texts: pre-read abstracts and conclusions; capture Metrics, Definitions, and boundary conditions; record page-accurate locators.

  

# Decision gates and exit criteria

- Gate 1 at 20 percent: continue only if you have two cards that map to immediate Plays.
- Gate 2 after Day 2 AM: keep exactly ten atomic notes; archive the rest. Scarcity forces clarity.
- Gate 3 after Day 3: if no experiment or decision emerged, mark the source "reference only" and stop revisits unless a project demands it.

  

# Metrics to keep the loop honest

- Capture selectivity: kept cards divided by total captured. Target 30 percent or less.
- Encode latency: median hours from first card to markdown note. Target under 48.
- Action ratio: plays executed divided by plays created from the book. Target 60 percent plus.
- Retrieval speed: time to assemble three notes for a live decision. Target under 2 minutes.

  

# Minimal kit and friction controls

- Cards: A6, dot-grid, 180--220 gsm; pocket sleeve with max 30 cards.
- Pen: fast-dry 0.5--0.7.
- Phone shortcut: shoot to /_inbox with timestamped filenames.
- Templates pre-saved for Note, Experiment, Decision, Source.
- Weekly merge pass to eliminate duplicates and link into maps.

  

# Failure modes and fixes

- Over-annotation. Fix: enforce ten-notes-per-book cap; kill at 20 percent if no plays.
- Drift from action to summarising. Fix: every note must include an Action or it gets archived.
- Fragmentation across media. Fix: stable IDs and a daily sweep; everything gets an ID or is culled.
- Decision amnesia. Fix: ADR-style decision records with review dates.

  

# One-page checklist you can tape inside the cover

1. Triage 15 minutes; write REF thread; set kill rule.

2. Capture 30--60 cards; cap ten per chapter; photograph end of day.

3. Distil ten atomic notes; link to one map and one project each.

4. Create one experiment or play; schedule and start.

5. Source dossier: 200-word synthesis; high-signal pages; links.

6. Cull three notes; add one or two to Leitner review.

7. Log outcomes; set decision review dates.

  

Run this loop for every book. The workbook routes, the cards think, the markdown remembers. The outputs are decisions and experiments, not summaries.
