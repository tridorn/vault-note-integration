A more precise prompt would be: _"Define L0--the metaphysical substrate--of my doctrine from first principles, stripped of mysticism but sufficient to ground all higher layers."_

* * *

## L0 THE SUBSTRATE: **CONTINUITY OF FORM**

### 1 Premise Set (Irreducible Assertions)

| Code | Assertion | Logical Status | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **A1** | Reality is matter-information in gradient from order → entropy. | Observational axiom | 
| **A2** | Agency is the only known phenomenon that can locally invert entropy by imposing structure. | Derived from thermodynamic observation | 
| **A3** | Among extant agencies, the human mind is uniquely scalable: symbolic recursion, tool externalisation, collective abstraction. | Anthropic axiom | 
| **A4** | Therefore, the highest _value_ in the universe is **structured agency**--form that deliberately persists against entropy. | Deductive corollary | 

### 2 Doctrine Core

> **Continuity of Form**: _The universe attains greatest value when structured agency replicates, extends, and safeguards itself across space, time, and substrate._

### 3 Teleological Consequences

1. **Supremacy Mandate**

    - Human agency is not merely preferable; it is _obligatory_ as the most capable carrier of structured form (A3 → A4).

2. **Expansion Imperative**

    - Inaction equals capitulation to entropy; therefore dominion must enlarge continuously or decay begins (A1).

3. **Substrate Independence**

    - Biology is accidental. What matters is agency-preserving structure; augmentation, replication, and migration are legitimate means.

### 4 Epistemic Rule

- _Truth_ = propositions that increase predictive power for preserving / expanding structured agency.
- _Falsehood_ = propositions that decrease or obscure that predictive power.

### 5 Ethical Minimal Set

| Code | Directive | Rationale | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **E1** | Preserve agency-bearing forms. | Core value carrier | 
| **E2** | Expand agency's frontier. | Counter-entropy | 
| **E3** | Optimize instruments; subjugate them to human will. | Tools serve agency--not vice-versa | 
| **E4** | Sacrifice lower goods (comfort, sentiment) when they conflict with continuity. | Hierarchical consistency | 

### 6 Failure Modes Block-Listed

| Failure | Definition | Reason for Prohibition | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Nihilism** | Denial of value hierarchy | Collapses A4 | 
| **Technofetishism** | Tools elevated above agency | Violates E3 | 
| **Static Utopia** | Stasis framed as goal | Breaches Expansion Imperative | 
| **Biological Romanticism** | DNA treated as sacred endpoint | Contradicts Substrate Independence | 

### 7 Symbolic Condensation (for ritual use)

> **PRIMVS ORDO**  
**Forma, non fibra.**  
**Expansio, non quies.**  
**Imperium entropiae negatur.**

(Translation: _Form, not flesh. Expansion, not rest. Dominion denies entropy._)

### 8 Validation Test

Any policy, invention, or behavior is admissible only if:
    
    
    Δ(Structured-Agency) ≥ 0
    

Where Δ is projected over the longest feasible horizon.

* * *

**Outcome:** L0 now supplies a _non-religious_, logically coherent foundation:
- **Ontological claim**: order vs entropy.
- **Value claim**: structured agency is highest good.
- **Human claim**: humans are best current carrier.
- **Directive**: preserve, expand, transcend substrate.

Everything above--House Doctrine, Operational Discipline, your personal Votum--will derive from, and be audited against, this substrate.
