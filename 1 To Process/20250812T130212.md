Love this kind of systems work. Let's reboot it from first principles and give you a clean, rational block model that scales--from a tiny idea note to a full project dossier--while keeping YAML as the single source of truth and mirroring each block as an H2.

  

Below are three interchangeable "profiles." Pick one or mix‑and‑match. Each block is a YAML object; each becomes an H2 section with the same name. I've included field suggestions, types, and short notes on why they exist.

# Profile A -- Comprehensive (all‑terrain knowledge + projects)

  

Goal: works for notes, research, and execution. 14 blocks.

### Matching H2 block layout (body)

- ## Identity
- ## Intent
- ## Lifecycle
- ## Scope
- ## Context
- ## Inputs
- ## Content
- ## Decisions
- ## Work
- ## Connections
- ## Taxonomy
- ## Sources
- ## Governance
- ## Metrics
- ## Operations
- ## History

  

Why this set:

- Separates why (Intent), what (Scope/Content), how (Work/Decisions), where it lives (Connections/Taxonomy), and controls (Governance/Operations/Metrics).
- Keeps your original ideas but clarifies names and boundaries.
- "Work" subsumes your old Flow. "Connections" supersedes Links. "Governance" refines Govern. "Operations" keeps Ops. "Metrics" stays. New, useful additions: Identity, Intent, Scope, Inputs, Decisions, History.

# Migration guide (old → new)

- Flow → Work (tasks, states, due dates) + Lifecycle (stage/status/priority) + Decisions (what was chosen and why).
- Taxonomy → Taxonomy (unchanged name, now facet‑based).
- Links → Connections (links_in/out, breadcrumbs, related).
- Content → Content (keep summary & structure).
- Source → Sources (bibliography + web).
- Govern → Governance (sensitivity, license, retention).
- Metrics → Metrics (same, add word_count/time_spent).
- Ops → Operations (export, automations).
- New: Identity, Intent, Scope, Inputs, Decisions, History.
* * *

# Naming & Dataview tips

- Use simple, snake_case keys and arrays over comma strings for compatibility.
- For statuses and stages, prefer small fixed enums so you can query reliably.
- Store dates as YYYY‑MM‑DD (and timestamps with timezone) for predictable sorting.
- Use facets inside Taxonomy for multi‑dimensional tagging you can query like:
    
    
    TABLE Taxonomy.facets.topic as Topic, Lifecycle.stage as Stage
    FROM "Notes"
    WHERE type = "project"

If you want, tell me your most common note types (e.g., meeting notes, design specs, tutorials), and I'll tailor enums + default fields for those so your queries and dashboards "just work."
