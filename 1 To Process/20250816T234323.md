Totally. Let's make the moving pieces (and the order of operations) crystal clear so you can start small, stay legal, and build real influence.

- Dornhelm (public-facing "Institute") = legitimacy engine (essays, briefs, standards proposals, events).
- Dornhelm Council (semi-private) = influence engine (small salons, off-record roundtables, coalition building).
- Parent HoldCo = your build/own/operate engine (ventures, acquisitions), sharing a light ops stack with the two Dornhelm arms.

  

> Compliance note (EU/Germany): once you actively seek to influence EU or federal policy, you'll likely hit registration/disclosure thresholds (EU Transparency Register; Germany's Lobbying Register Act updated in 2024--25). Plan for this early so "quiet" convening stays lawful even if it's discreet.

# General considerations (so you don't step on rakes)

  

1) Start light; earn the right to add weight.

Don't launch a heavy nonprofit or foundation on day one. Begin with a branded initiative under HoldCo, then spin out when there's traction or a funding need.

  

2) Separate audiences, not values.

Public: civilisational essays, standards, foresight. Private: convene stakeholders to align interests. Same principles, different rooms.

  

3) Don't over-promise transparency.

Use language like "research + convening + stakeholder engagement." It's accurate and keeps room for quiet coalition work--while still complying with registers where required. (EU register = database of organizations trying to influence EU lawmaking; it exists for this.)

  

4) Guardrails over secrecy.

You can be discreet and principled: short code-of-conduct, COI policy, and a simple interests registry you can expand later. That's your reputational insurance.

  

5) Legal hygiene is strategy.

- EU level: Transparency Register (practical if you want meetings/invites; increasingly expected).
- Germany: Lobbyregistergesetz (scope widened in 2024; harsher penalties for non-compliance).

Design your activity mix with counsel so your Council's off-record convenings don't accidentally breach lobbying rules.

  

6) Aim your content where policy is moving.

The EU's space agenda (space traffic management, emerging "EU space law", Copernicus futures) gives you hooks and timelines for briefs, events, and pilots.

  

7) Funding logic.

Early: self-funded + small sponsorships for events. Later: apply for EU R&I grants (Horizon Europe -- Space) via the Institute once you spin it out.

# Build it from the ground up (phased, lean)

  

## Phase 0--3 months -- "Kernel"

  

Goal: get a credible voice and a room running, without heavy entities.

- Brand: launch Dornhelm (site + simple visual ID).
- Byline: publish as Tristan Dornhelm with a clear one-line disclosure to Ben Jendyk on the About page.
- Outputs:

    - 1 flagship essay ("A Standards Agenda for a Space-Age Civilization").

    - 1 short brief on an EU-relevant topic (e.g., "Implementing STM in Europe: A private-sector playbook").
- Council v0: host a 10--15 person, invite-only salon (Chatham House Rule).
- Ops: keep it inside HoldCo (accounting, contracts, website) to avoid duplication.

  

## Phase 4--9 months -- "Platform"

  

Goal: cadence + community + compliance.
- Cadence: monthly essays; quarterly foresight brief; two salons (policy + industry).
- Event: one public Forum (60--120 ppl) with an off-record Council dinner the night before.
- Compliance prep:

    - If you start engaging EU/federal officials with intent to influence, get into the EU Transparency Register and Germany's Lobbyregister as appropriate.

    - Draft light COI/engagement policy (who attends, funding acknowledgements).
- Funding: small sponsorships for the Forum (publish categories, not line items).

  

## Phase 10--18 months -- "Spin-out & scale"

  

Goal: formalize the Institute when it pays to.

- Entity: incorporate Dornhelm Institute gGmbH (research/education) to take grants and issue fellowships; keep Dornhelm Council as a sister vehicle (e.g., Verein or unit within HoldCo) for invite-only convening.
- Programs: announce a 6--9 month Fellows pilot (2--3 fellows).
- Grants: apply to Horizon Europe -- Space calls where your Institute can partner with universities/industry.
- Pipeline to ventures: run a standards-to-pilots loop with HoldCo (e.g., debris scoring, STM testing, on-orbit servicing safety), always keeping disclosure clean.

  

## Phase 18--36 months -- "Institution"

  

Goal: an addressable community + recognized seat at the table.
- Annual Congress (public), Council Summit (off-record).
- Metrics: citations by EU/national bodies; invited testimony; coalition MOUs; grant wins; number of pilots launched with industry/regulators.
- Apex governance (optional): add stewardship/purpose vehicle if you want to mission-lock voting control across the ecosystem (foundation/purpose trust; "steward-ownership" patterns).
* * *

# Who does what (roles, lean)

- You (Founder/Editor-at-Large): define agenda, write anchor pieces, host Council rooms.
- Chief of Staff/Research Lead (contract initially): pipeline topics, manage briefs, coordinate salons.
- Ops (shared with HoldCo): finance, legal, design, web.
- Advisory circle (3--5 people): ex-regulator, space ops scientist, export-control lawyer, standards engineer--names on site for credibility; involved lightly.
* * *

# Minimal policies to publish now (keeps trust without handcuffs)

- Mission & Methods: "We publish research, convene stakeholders, and engage with policymakers and industry to advance practical standards."
- Funding note: "We disclose funding categories and major sponsors; editorial judgments remain independent."
- Engagement note: "We hold both public and off-record forums under widely-used rules to enable frank discussion."
- Conflicts: short page listing any material overlaps with ventures when they exist.

  

(This is honest and flexible; it doesn't box you into promises you can't keep.)

* * *

# Risks you're managing (and how)

- Regulatory: mis-registration. → Map activities to EU/German rules; register when thresholds are met.
- Reputation: gap between public brand and private brokering. → Strategic, accurate wording from day one; stick to it.
- Capture/COI: ventures benefiting from policies. → Disclose material ties; keep independent reviewers on papers.
- Overbuild: too many entities too soon. → Stage gates above; spin out only when needed.
* * *

# Where to anchor early content (because timing matters)

- EU Space Traffic Management (live policy track; lots of entry points).
- EU "Space Law" discussions (framework signals; you can propose practical implementation standards).
- Horizon Europe Space calls (use participation to build coalitions & credibility, not just money).
* * *

## Bottom line

- Build Dornhelm as a lightweight institute now (publish + convene), and a semi-private Council for real influence--both incubated under HoldCo at first.
- Add formal entities and registrations only as your activity clearly meets thresholds or funding opportunities justify them.
- Keep the whole thing lawful, discreet, and principled--with simple guardrails instead of grand transparency promises you can't maintain.

  

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page internal "operating memo" you can share with counsel and your first hire (roles, calendar, compliance checklist, and first two topic briefs).
