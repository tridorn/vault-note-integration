## Structural Clarifications

- **Tier 1 = capability + cash infrastructure**. The delivery cells. Profitable, modular, and stackable.
- **Tier 2 = vertical integration layer**. Converts Tier 1 capabilities into repeatable product-market units. Tests scale readiness.
- **Tier 3 = speculative moonshots with structural leverage**. High-value, high-complexity systems that can only exist _after_ Tier 1 + Tier 2 prove demand and tooling.

Every Tier 3 venture should **reduce to a recombination of Tier 1 capabilities**, validated by Tier 2 market demand, and made possible through internal cash recycling.

If you want, I'll now map these units into a **visual interaction architecture**, showing which unit feeds which.
