Lower the entry barrier extremely. Have monthly cycles (with weekly sprints) that have freely accessible teams and every changing ones. After every month the teams can switch or stay. Create a matching platform and in general ways for people to connect and find each other.  
Possibly tier it: 

- a pre-incubator like that. Where there is close to zero responsibility or anything attached, just a free sand box to meet people, learn, and test. Provide information like how to setup, communication, project based working, tasks, agile and all of that
