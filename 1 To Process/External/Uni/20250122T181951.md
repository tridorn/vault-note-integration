# Fully Integrated AKB Ecosystem

Your inquiry might have been better articulated as: “Could you provide a more detailed breakdown of what components of the IT ecosystem will be hosted on AWS and how they will interact within the broader system architecture?”

Now that you’ve chosen AWS, I’ll outline in detail what specific components you will host on AWS and how each part will be managed, from compute and storage to automation and integrations. This approach will allow you to maximize AWS’s strengths and ensure your IT infrastructure scales effectively with the needs of the initiative.

### **Core AWS Components for Hosting Your IT Ecosystem**

The following list details how AWS can support all the various elements of your IT ecosystem:

---

### **1. Compute: Hosting Your Applications and Website**

#### **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

	**Purpose**: EC2 instances are virtual servers where you can host your member portal, internal systems, ticketing system, and web applications.

	**Usage**:
	- **Member Portal**: Your primary web portal (e.g., WordPress) will be hosted on an EC2 instance. This portal can include member profiles, event registration, financial tools, and resource sharing.
	- **Ticketing System**: The helpdesk or ticketing system (e.g., **Freshdesk** or a custom-built system) can also run on the same instance or another instance, depending on resource requirements.
	- **Event Registration and Analytics**: Tools for registering members for events and tracking engagement can be integrated into the portal and hosted here.

	**Configuration**:
	- Start with a **t2.micro** or **t3.micro** instance (free-tier eligible), which is sufficient for a small website or system with low traffic.
	- Install the **LAMP stack** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) if you're running WordPress or similar web applications.
	- **Scaling**: As traffic grows, AWS offers **Auto Scaling** to automatically add or remove instances based on demand.

	**Costs**: Free for 750 hours/month for a **t2.micro** instance under the AWS Free Tier.

### **2. Storage: File and Media Storage**

#### **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

	**Purpose**: S3 is an object storage service, ideal for storing large volumes of data like documents, media, and static assets for your member portal.

	**Usage**:
	- **Document Storage**: Use S3 to store shared documents such as event materials, reports, and educational content.
	- **Media Storage**: Videos of webinars, events, and presentations can also be stored in S3. You can later link them to the member portal for streaming.
	- **Static Content Delivery**: Any static content on your website—like images, CSS, and JavaScript files—can be stored in S3 for fast, reliable delivery.

	**Configuration**:
	- **Buckets**: Create different **S3 buckets** to organize and separate types of files (e.g., one for documents, another for media).
	- **Access Control**: Implement **IAM roles** to control who can upload, view, and manage files in each bucket.
	- **Lifecycle Policies**: Set up lifecycle rules to move old or infrequently accessed files to cheaper storage classes like **S3 Glacier**.

	**Costs**: Free for the first 5GB of storage under the AWS Free Tier, and $0.023/GB for additional usage.

### **3. Databases: Managing Structured Data**

#### **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**

	**Purpose**: RDS will host your structured data, such as member information, event registration data, ticketing logs, and any other database-driven applications.

	**Usage**:
	- **User Data**: Store member profiles, preferences, and activity data in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
	- **Event Registrations**: Track event attendance, registration details, and feedback through database queries.
	- **Financial Data**: Store financial records, stock simulation results, and transaction data securely.

	**Configuration**:
	- Select **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** based on the technology you prefer (both are free-tier eligible).
	- Set up **automated backups** and snapshots to ensure data is recoverable.
	- Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor the health of your database and set alerts if performance degrades or storage reaches critical levels.

	**Costs**: Free for 750 hours/month of **db.t2.micro** usage and 20GB of storage under the AWS Free Tier. After that, it will cost around $15-20/month for a small instance.

### **4. File Sharing and Document Collaboration**

#### **Amazon WorkDocs**

	**Purpose**: If you want a more enterprise-level document management system integrated with AWS, **Amazon WorkDocs** allows secure file storage, sharing, and collaboration among your team members.

	**Usage**:
	- **Team Collaboration**: Similar to Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive, WorkDocs lets team members share files and collaborate securely within the AWS ecosystem.
	- **Permission Control**: Assign roles and permissions for file access, ensuring that only authorized users can view or edit sensitive files.

	**Configuration**:
	- Set up **WorkDocs Drive** to allow team members to access files as though they are on a shared drive, but stored in the cloud.
	- Configure **WorkDocs permissions** to control which users or groups have access to specific documents.

	**Costs**: Free for the first 1TB of storage for up to 50 users.

### **5. Remote Access and Virtual Desktops**

#### **Amazon WorkSpaces**

	**Purpose**: WorkSpaces is AWS's virtual desktop service, allowing members to access a Windows or Linux desktop environment remotely, with access to Office 365, shared files, and more.

	**Usage**:
	- **Remote Access**: If your team needs a dedicated desktop environment for collaboration or development, AWS WorkSpaces provides each user with a virtual desktop that can run applications like Office, development tools, or other software.
	- **Secure Connection**: Each user can connect securely via the AWS WorkSpaces client from any location.

	**Configuration**:
	- Set up **WorkSpaces** with pre-configured environments tailored to specific roles (e.g., admin, developer, or general user).
	- Integrate **Microsoft Active Directory** for centralized user management and authentication.

	**Costs**: WorkSpaces has a pay-as-you-go model, starting at around $25/month for a basic Windows instance. However, costs depend on the specifications and usage time.
