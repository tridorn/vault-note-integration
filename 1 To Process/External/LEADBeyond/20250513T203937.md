### Hypothesis Tree – “Radiator Growth & Margin Restoration 2025‑30”

> **Root Business Question**
> *What discrete forces must Zehnder affirm—or neutralise—to unlock sustained share‑gain and EBIT expansion across its European radiator franchise?*

Below, each **driver** branches into **engagement‑grade, “low‑friction” hypotheses**: propositions your Zehnder counterparts can validate instantly from lived reality, field data or intuition—no esoteric analysis required.  Positive confirmation supplies you the mandate for later strategic prescriptions.

#### How to Mobilise

1. **Pre‑Workshop Distribution** – Email the table; ask stakeholders to pre‑score each hypothesis 1‑5 (“strongly disagree” → “strongly agree”).
2. **Kick‑Off Live Poll** – Use mentimeter or show‑of‑hands to visualise alignment gaps in real time.
3. **Focus the Debate** – Concentrate discussion on high‑impact / low‑consensus items; record qualitative nuance.
4. **Convert to Work‑Plan** – Affirmed hypotheses become guiding assumptions; disputed ones flag immediate analysis sprints.

This tree arms you with conversation catalysts that feel native to Zehnder’s operational reality while quietly steering them toward the strategy you intend to formalise later.
