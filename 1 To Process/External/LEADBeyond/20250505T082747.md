You are now tasked with executing a comparative *market intelligence synthesis* across five European countries (DE, FR, UK, IT, CH), focusing on the radiator sector. The exemplar you've shared sets a high bar: it fuses demand data, macro trends, competition, and positioning into a compact strategic snapshot.

Here’s how to proceed with **methodological rigor and replicability**, while cultivating your analytical judgment:

---

## **I. Build a Modular Template (Before Research)**

Create a **research architecture** identical across countries so insights are structurally comparable. Use the UK one-pager as a skeleton:

1. **Market Demand Snapshot**
2. **Macro & Regulatory Trends**
3. **Competitor & Positioning Landscape**
4. **Segment Outlook (Product Categories)**
5. **Zehnder Opportunity Areas**

This is your schema—lock it before beginning country-specific research.

---

## **II. Research Process (Country-by-Country)**

### Step 1: **Market Demand Snapshot**

* **Sources**: Statista, Eurostat, IEA heating reports, national energy agencies (e.g., BMWK in Germany)
* **Data to extract**:

  * Installed base of radiators or heating systems
  * Replacement cycles or penetration trends
  * Electrification or heat pump adoption rates
  * Any CAGR data on radiator or HVAC sectors

> *Germany, France, and Italy have large gas-to-heat pump transition dynamics. Prioritize that data.*

---

### Step 2: **Macro & Regulatory Trends**

* Identify:

  * National energy transition plans (e.g., Germany’s *Gebäudeeffizienzstrategie*)
  * Heat pump incentives, boiler bans, EPBD implementations
  * Renovation schemes (e.g., MaPrimeRénov' in France, Superbonus in Italy)
  * Regulatory temperature mandates (e.g., CH 55°C design laws)

> *Use EU-level directives (EPBD) as base, then layer local accelerators or blockers.*

---

### Step 3: **Competitor Landscape**

* Use:

  * Annual reports of Zehnder, Stelrad, Purmo
  * Local distributor and installer networks (e.g., GC Gruppe in DE)
  * Scan for regional champions or local design houses
  * Note if competitors play commodity vs. premium

Build a **simple competitor map per country**:
\| Brand | Positioning | Distribution Focus | Product Strength |

---

### Step 4: **Segment Outlook**

* Reuse UK categories:

  * Standard panel radiators
  * Towel radiators
  * Designer/premium
  * Electric
  * Hybrid/Fan-assisted
* For each, assess:

  * Volume relevance
  * Growth trajectory
  * Local nuances (e.g., electric in IT rural homes; premium design in CH)

---

### Step 5: **Opportunity Areas**

Now synthesize: Where is **Zehnder** best positioned to strike?

* Leverage *premium design* in high-margin markets
* Exploit *electric + high-output niches* in high-heat-pump-uptake countries
* Use *retailer/channel strategies* where competitors are weak

Tailor to each country's **regulatory push + consumer taste + competitor gap**.

---

## **III. Build Deliverables in Iterations**

Start with **one country (Germany)** and treat it as a template refinement exercise. Use the UK page as a benchmark.

> After DE is complete, build FR, then replicate iteratively.

---

## **IV. Strategic Time Management**

Assume:

* \~90–120 minutes per country if you're thorough
* First one (DE) will take longer as you build reusable scaffolding

Document all sources in a central file. It’ll be critical when challenged on assumptions.

## Do You Want:

* A **blank editable slide template** modeled on the UK version?
* A list of **curated sources per country** to accelerate your desk research?

Which country do you want to tackle first—Germany?
