In consulting, **research and analysis are not scavenger hunts**--they are acts of _targeted dissection_. The fatal mistake is to start collecting information. That's what civilians do. **You don't "do research." You test hypotheses.**

Here is the **process that transforms you from a researcher into a surgical analyst**, using what I'll call the **RAPT Method**:

* * *

## **The RAPT Method: Research as Applied Problem Testing**

Each research task or analysis follows this unchanging sequence:

### **1. Reframe the Ask into a Hypothesis**

Never "look into" something. Always **convert the request into a testable belief**.

> Example task: "Research market entry for German EV charging."

Reframe into:

> Hypothesis: "Germany's EV charging market will grow 20% YoY due to regulatory incentives and OEM mandates, making entry feasible by 2026."

**Why?** Because hypotheses impose boundaries and intent. You now know what to **prove or disprove**, not just what to read.
* * *

### **2. Assemble the Skeleton: Key Drivers and Judgement Axes**

Every hypothesis relies on **assumptions**--identify them upfront.

> In our EV example:

- Market growth is real (data)
- Growth is accessible (competitive landscape)
- Regulation is supportive (policy)
- Our client has a right to win (capability match)

Write these as **sub-hypotheses** or **judgment criteria**. You now have a **mini-framework**.
* * *

### **3. Precision Research: Pull Only to Validate**

You now target **specific validation elements**, not general data.

Use this **ladder** of research sources--from fast to deep:

| Source Type | Purpose | Tools/Examples | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Prior Firm Materials | Slide decks, case studies | Ask partners, scrape internal drives | 
| Benchmark Decks | Market comps, KPI ranges | Google Slideshare, Pitchbook, MBB reports | 
| Public Data | Market size, trends, financials | Statista, EU reports, industry bodies | 
| News & Analyst Memos | Regulation, entry stories | Google News, press releases | 
| Expert Calls | Judgment where data is thin | Ask partners if expert networks exist | 

**Key Practice**:  
For each source, ask: _"Does this help confirm or kill one of my assumptions?"_  
If not, discard it--even if it's "interesting."

* * *

### **4. Transform Research into Argument**

**Never just summarize. Always convert findings into conclusions.**  
Use the **3-1 Rule**:

> For every 3 data points, produce 1 sharp conclusion.

Example:

- Statista says market CAGR is 17%
- German transport policy mandates 1M chargers by 2030
- Tesla and Ionity are expanding footprint 2x

**Conclusion slide**:  
"EV infrastructure demand is accelerating beyond installed base growth, making market entry a timing play."

Support with:

- Chart: Market growth (stat)
- Quote: Policy trigger
- Visual: Competitive moves

## Your Daily Discipline Checklist

Each time you're given a task, run this **RAPT Discipline**:

1. **Reframe the Ask**

    - What is the _real_ hypothesis I'm being asked to test?

    - What must be true for that to hold?

2. **List Sub-Hypotheses**

    - Break the big belief into 3--5 testable claims

3. **Design Research Targets**

    - What _exactly_ do I need to find to validate each claim?

    - What's the best source to find it?

4. **Record Conclusion per Input**

    - Don't collect. Synthesize.

    - Always ask: "What does this prove?"

5. **Drop into Slide Format Immediately**

    - Every 1--2 conclusions = 1 slide

    - Title = Insight; Chart = Proof; Text = Implication

Would you like a template table or doc structure to manage these tasks step by step? I can produce a downloadable format to use per research/analysis assignment.
