Excellent demand. Let's build this out **top-down**, in a **logical cascade of outputs**, so you can _see the information architecture_ that a real consultant builds in sequence--and how each layer enables the next.

* * *

# **CLEAR Framework -- Core Outputs and Information Cascade**

This structure will show:

- What output is produced at each step
- Where that output branches into the next
- How you _visualise the flow of logic_ from abstract to concrete
* * *

## **Top-Level Objective: A Coherent, Defensible Recommendation**

That's the final product. Everything below is scaffolding to support it.
    
    
    FINAL OUTPUT:
    → Recommendation + Justification + Implications
    

This output is only possible if you've gone through the chain of prior reasoning. Let's break it down.

* * *

## **STEP 1: CLARIFY -- From Ambiguity to Logical Map**

| **Core Outputs** | **Description** | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Problem Statement** | 1--2 clear sentences defining _what is being solved_, and why. | 
| **Key Question (KQ)** | Sharp framing of what you're answering. Think: "How can X be improved by Y?" | 
| **Logic/Issue Tree** | Visual or written breakdown of all drivers/branches of the problem -- MECE logic. | 
| **Prioritized Drivers** | Selection of 2--3 critical branches to focus your analysis on. | 
| **Initial Hypotheses** | Provisional beliefs tied to each priority branch: "We believe X because Y." | 

### → Branching Logic:

From **Key Question**, you generate **Drivers**, then attach **Hypotheses** to each one.

> **KQ**: "How can we reduce sales cycle duration by 20%?"  
→ Driver 1: Lead qualification → Hypothesis A: "Low-quality leads delay conversion"  
→ Driver 2: Contracting → Hypothesis B: "Legal review adds 15+ days"
* * *

## **STEP 2: LEVERAGE -- From Hypotheses to Proof-Targets**

| **Core Outputs** | **Description** | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Hypothesis List** | Each with a clear statement and assumptions | 
| **Evidence Map** | For each hypothesis: what specific data/benchmark/interview is needed | 
| **Sources and Access Plan** | Where you'll find what you need, who has it, and how fast you can get it | 
| **Research Summary Notes** | As-you-go synthesis: For every 2--3 findings, write 1 conclusion | 

### → Branching Logic:

Each **Hypothesis** triggers an **Evidence Test**, producing micro-conclusions.

> **Hypothesis A**: "Low-quality leads delay conversion"  
→ Need: Lead scoring data by funnel stage  
→ Finding: 60% of leads from Channel X never move past stage 2  
→ Conclusion: Channel X pollutes pipeline; should be deprioritized

* * *

## **STEP 3: EVALUATE -- From Findings to Logic**

| **Core Outputs** | **Description** | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Validated Hypotheses (Yes/No/Mixed)** | Each tested and categorized based on findings | 
| **Mini-Models** | Excel-based quantitative logics (e.g., impact of fixing X = 12 days saved) | 
| **Trade-Offs & Risks** | For each potential intervention, what are 2nd order effects? | 
| **Synthesis Points** | Slide-level arguments: each slide = 1 insight, 1 proof | 

### → Branching Logic:

Multiple **Micro-Conclusions** feed into **one Synthesis Point** per driver.

> From 3--5 data points → prove Hypothesis B  
→ "Legal review causes avg. 18-day delay"  
→ Model shows standardizing contracts could reduce delay by 12 days

* * *

## **STEP 4: ADVISE -- From Logic to Direction**

| **Core Outputs** | **Description** | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Recommendation Tree** | Options A / B / C each with rationale and implications | 
| **Primary Recommendation** | Clearly selected path with justification | 
| **Implementation Roadmap** | Phases, actions, owners, timelines | 
| **Risk Mitigation Plan** | Key failure points and preemptive safeguards | 

### → Branching Logic:

Each **Synthesis Point** supports a **Recommendation Node**. You link cause → solution → outcome.

> **Insight**: Legal delay = 18 days  
→ **Option**: Standardize contracts  
→ **Tradeoff**: 5% of deals need custom terms  
→ **Mitigation**: Exception flow for Tier 1 clients

* * *

## **STEP 5: RELAY -- From Direction to Persuasion**

| **Core Outputs** | **Description** | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Slide Deck** | Executive Summary + Situation + Drivers + Analysis + Recommendation | 
| **Slide Titles = Conclusions** | Each slide should state its key insight | 
| **Backup Slides** | Charts, data cuts, model outputs behind every assertion | 
| **Talk Track / Q&A Prep** | Answers to: "Why this?", "What if not?", "What's next?" | 

### → Branching Logic:

**Each Recommendation Node** = 1--3 slides → defend it with model + data → end with roadmap.

> Slide 7: "Legal review is main bottleneck"  
Slide 8: "Standard contracts reduce delay by 12 days"  
Slide 9: "Recommendation: implement contract standardization in Q3"

* * *

    [Problem Statement]  
        ↓  
    [Key Question]  
        ↓  
    [Logic Tree → Drivers]

    [Hypotheses per Driver]

        ↓  
    [Primary Recommendation + Roadmap]  
        ↓  
    [Deck + Talk Track]
    

Everything cascades **top-down**, from strategic ambiguity to analytical precision, then back up to executive clarity.
