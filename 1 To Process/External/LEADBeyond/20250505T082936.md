You're executing a **compact intelligence synthesis loop**. The goal: produce high-impact country overviews with minimal tooling, maximum sharpness. Here’s your **zero-setup loop** using Flourish + Datawrapper for visual punch—without bloated systems or code.

---

## 🎯 Your Objective Today

Deliver **5 strategic country one-pagers** (DE, FR, UK, IT, CH) that:

1. Are **visually distinct** (not Excel dumps)
2. Fuse **narrative + numbers + insight**
3. Can be **read, shared, or presented as standalone assets**
4. Create **a basis for future dashboarding**

---

## 🌀 THE LOOP – Tactical Workflow for Each Country (\~45–60 min/country)

### **1. Set Up the Template (20 mins upfront)**

* Use **PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides**
* Make a single-page layout with 5 clear sections:

  * 📊 **Market Demand** (Size, Growth)
  * 🧩 **Segment Outlook** (Standard vs Premium vs Electric)
  * 🏛️ **Macro / Regulatory Trends**
  * 🥊 **Competitive Landscape**
  * 🎯 **Zehnder Play / Opportunity**

→ Save as a master. Clone for each country.

---

### **2. Build Your Mini Data Set (10 min/country)**

Create a simple table (Excel or Notion):

| Country | KPI             | Value |
| ------- | --------------- | ----- |
| DE      | MarketSize\_M   | 34.2  |
| DE      | 5yr\_CAGR       | 3.7%  |
| DE      | HP\_Penetration | 22%   |
| DE      | RegulatoryScore | 4.5   |
| DE      | ZehnderShare    | 18%   |

→ Do this per country. You'll reuse this for both visuals.

---

### **3. Inject Datawrapper Chart (5–10 min)**

**Use for a clean heat-map or KPI comparison.**

**Steps:**

* Go to [datawrapper.de](https://datawrapper.de)
* Chart type: *Table with heatmap coloring*
* Paste your KPI table
* Format: color scales (green high → red low), % formatting
* Download as PNG and insert in slide

> ✅ *Great for country-vs-country KPI comparison or per-country “KPI scorecard”*

---

### **4. Inject Flourish Chart (5–10 min)**

**Use for radar chart (spider) or segmented bar.**

**Steps:**

* Go to [flourish.studio](https://flourish.studio)
* Template: *Radar (Spider)* or *Bar chart race*
* Country = series, KPIs = axes
* Customize labels and colors (Zehnder = green)
* Publish → download PNG → insert in slide

> ✅ *Delivers instant visual hierarchy across multiple KPIs (growth, fit, heat pump, etc.)*

---

### **5. Synthesize Opportunity (10–15 min)**

Ask yourself:

* What’s the dominant strategic **tailwind**?
* Where’s the **white space** in competition?
* What makes this **Zehnder-fit** vs. not?

Then distill into 2–3 sentences:

> “Germany combines policy-driven retrofit acceleration with a fragmented panel segment. Zehnder can win via high-output premium panels before 2026 subsidy taper.”

Place it bottom-center in your slide. This is your **executive takeaway**.

## 🔁 Final Touches

* Title slide: “Radiator Market Opportunity Mapping – 2024”
* Add country flags or mini map icons for polish
* Export as PDF or Google Slides link

---

## ⏱️ Time Budget (per country)

| Task                  | Time     |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| Desk research         | 20–30m   |
| Data + chart building | 15m      |
| Narrative synthesis   | 10–15m   |
| Slide finalization    | 5m       |
| **Total**             | \~45–60m |

---

## 🧠 Outcome

You walk out with:

* 5 sharp, visual one-pagers
* Reusable data structure for future dashboarding
* Immediate visual impact with **zero licensing, coding, or IT friction**

Would you like a **slide template starter file** (editable Google Slide or PPTX) pre-structured for this format?
