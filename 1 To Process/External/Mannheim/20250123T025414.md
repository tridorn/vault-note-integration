Your notes, though scattered, already suggest a coherent concept, albeit needing a more refined and structured approach. You may consider expressing your ideas like this:

"Arbeitskreis für Universitätskultur Mannheim" – this group would focus on modern and innovative projects aimed at enhancing the University of Mannheim. By conducting trend research and gathering student feedback through surveys, it would create a pulse of student sentiments, which could serve as a valuable resource for the university. The initiative could potentially become a professional data repository relating to student life and campus improvements.

**Core elements of the initiative**:
- **Professionalism in Data Collection**: A unique selling point (USP) for participating students is that they would learn how to collect and present data in a professional manner—useful skills both academically and for future employment.
- **Contributing to Campus Culture**: Like a university magazine but focused on data, the initiative would contribute to university culture by publishing reports, some serious, others playful (e.g., humorous polls about pizza preferences), creating a stronger sense of community.
- **Launching Data-Driven Change**: Based on the data collected, the initiative could kickstart movements for change within the university, providing analysis specifically relevant to University of Mannheim.
- **Broader Outreach and Identity**: The name *BrauchtUM* (a play on "Brauchtum" and "Universität Mannheim") cleverly juxtaposes tradition and the need for change, representing the initiative’s mission. This naming could be expanded nationally, with local versions for other universities (e.g., BrauchtTUM for Technical University of Munich, BrauchtLMU for Ludwig Maximilian University).

**Playful Elements**:
- Ironically elaborate titles and perks (such as the privilege to wear a monocle) would inject a humorous touch, creating intrigue and engagement. You might also consider playful sub-projects like "Fauxmoi" for entertaining rumors or light-hearted student polls, further contributing to campus life.

**Flexible Participation**: The initiative could offer project-based work, allowing students to participate on a report-by-report basis. This would ensure flexible involvement without heavy long-term commitment. It also provides excellent preparation for writing a bachelor thesis or similar academic work.

**Implementation**:
- Weekly surveys posted in student groups, with verification through university emails, followed by publication of the results on Fridays.
- Potentially, a live display of current survey results on campus screens, fostering ongoing engagement with the initiative’s work.

**Scalability**: This initiative could extend beyond Mannheim to other universities, each with its own *Braucht*-branded name but maintaining the core mission of fostering campus improvement through data collection and analysis.

### Refinement Suggestions

1. **Anchoring Seriousness with Playfulness**: While the whimsical aspects (like monocles and faux rumors) are important for engagement, they should never undermine the credibility of the data or reports produced. Consider keeping these as secondary features, ensuring the main reports remain professional and robust.
	
2. **Institutional Buy-In**: Securing support from the university administration early on might bolster the initiative’s legitimacy. This support could manifest as access to university channels for distributing surveys, official endorsement, or even funding.

3. **Outreach**: You could partner with student associations, academic departments, and administrative bodies to ensure the data collected addresses relevant and impactful topics.

By anchoring this initiative within the Ben Dyk brand, it would align with your broader vision of creating distinctive, interdisciplinary contributions that blend professionalism with cultural engagement.
