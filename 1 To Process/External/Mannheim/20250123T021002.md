# Creating the Initiative

- Let as many participate as possible
- From the start say that they will create something far larger than an initiative, they will create an empire
- Clearly state that work here will be more demanding
- Also make clear that they will be recognised in the annals (specific area dedicated to people who made a significant contribution) and will get a special document 
- In general, provide recognition to people through naming for example rooms (not the startups they created but the people behind it)
- Possibly positive work culture like voting for people to get recognition
- Implement agile methods and project-based teams
- Establish English at all? Early on or later?
