Certainly. Here is a **very concrete and step-by-step action plan** that you can start right now, with each step building on the previous one.

---

### **Step-by-Step Action Plan**

---

### **Step 1: Define Your Purpose and Niche (Today, 30 minutes)**

- **Action**: Open a document and write down the precise purpose of your initiative.
  - *Example*: "To create a platform for collaboration between business and technical students in Mannheim, Darmstadt, and Karlsruhe, focusing on entrepreneurship and innovation."
- **Next**: Identify a **niche** that intersects both business and technical fields.
  - *Example*: "Tech startups, product management, business models for AI, etc."

---

### **Step 2: Research Key Contacts (Today, 1 hour)**

- **Action**: Research the official websites or LinkedIn pages for the universities of Darmstadt and Karlsruhe.
  - *Search for*: Student associations (entrepreneurship, tech, innovation), faculty involved in relevant fields (business-technology intersection), or university events you could attend.
  - **Next**: Create a list of 5-10 potential contacts: students, associations, or professors who might be interested in collaboration.

---

### **Step 3: Initial Outreach (Today, 1.5-2 hours)**

- **Action**: Draft a concise, professional message or email introducing yourself, your concept, and inviting them to a casual virtual meeting or a collaborative conversation.
  - **Message Template**:
	 - *Subject*: "Exploring Collaboration between Mannheim, Darmstadt, and Karlsruhe Students"
	 - *Body*:
		- "Dear [Name],
		- My name is Ben Jendyk, a business administration student at the University of Mannheim. I’m currently exploring opportunities to foster collaboration between students of Mannheim, Darmstadt, and Karlsruhe, particularly in the fields of entrepreneurship and innovation. I'd love to hear your thoughts and explore how we might create synergies between our schools. Would you be open to a brief virtual meeting?"
		- Best regards,
		- Ben Jendyk"
- **Next**: Send this to 5-10 contacts (students, associations, or professors). Choose email or LinkedIn, depending on what you find during your research.

---

### **Step 4: Set Up a Communication Platform (Tomorrow, 30 minutes)**

- **Action**: Create a **Slack** or **Discord** workspace specifically for this initiative.
  - Channels could include:
	 - #general-discussion
	 - #project-ideas
	 - #events
- **Next**: Once you get responses, invite the interested parties to this platform for easy communication.

---

### **Step 5: Plan a Small Virtual Meetup (Tomorrow, 1-2 hours)**

- **Action**: Use Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet to set up a virtual meeting for anyone who responds positively to your outreach.
  - **Goal**: Casual conversation about potential collaborations and interests.
  - **Preparation**: Prepare 3 discussion points that are relevant to the audience (e.g., “What kind of business-technology projects have you worked on before?”).
  - **Next**: Send out meeting invites to those who respond positively to your outreach.

---

### **Step 6: Attend Relevant Events (This Week, 2-3 hours)**

- **Action**: Find and attend 1-2 relevant online or in-person events hosted by Darmstadt or Karlsruhe. These could be guest lectures, startup competitions, or tech workshops. This will help you build connections and understand their academic culture.
  - **How**: Check the universities’ official events calendars, or search for events on Eventbrite, Meetup.com, or university Facebook pages.

---

### **Step 7: Organize a Pilot Event (Next Week, 4-6 Hours total)**

- **Action**: Plan a very **small, focused event** to test the waters.
  - **Type of Event**: A virtual roundtable discussion or a mini-workshop on a specific topic that both business and tech students find useful (e.g., "The Role of Technology in Business Startups").
  - **Preparation**:
	 - **Invite**: Send out invitations to your contacts from the previous steps.
	 - **Agenda**: Prepare a 30-minute agenda with clear discussion points.
	 - **Promote**: Use your network (Slack/Discord), social media, or university mailing lists to promote the event.

---

### **Step 8: Collect Feedback and Adjust (Immediately After Event)**

- **Action**: After your pilot event, send a short feedback survey via Google Forms or Typeform to all participants.
  - Questions could include:
	 - What did you enjoy most about the event?
	 - What could be improved for future events?
	 - What kind of future events would you be interested in attending?
  - **Next**: Use the feedback to adjust your approach for future initiatives and identify what areas of collaboration are the most interesting to the students.

---

### **Step 9: Expand Your Network (Ongoing, 1-2 Hours per week)**

- **Action**: Continuously reach out to more students, professors, and industry professionals.
  - Join relevant LinkedIn groups, university clubs, or associations.
  - Keep building your contact list and sending invitations to join your platform.

---

### **Step 10: Plan the Next Phase (After 2 Weeks)**

- **Action**: Once you've completed your first event, met some initial collaborators, and gathered feedback, you can start planning the **next, larger initiative**.
  - **Possibilities**:
	 - Partner with a professor for a guest lecture series.
	 - Collaborate on a joint research project or business plan competition.
	 - Formalize the organization by officially registering a student association (if needed).

### **Immediate Actions You Can Take Right Now**

1. **Define your purpose** in a document or notebook (30 minutes).
2. **Research 5-10 key contacts** at Darmstadt and Karlsruhe using LinkedIn and university websites (1 hour).
3. **Draft and send initial outreach messages** via email or LinkedIn (1-2 hours).

Each of these steps builds incrementally to test your idea in real time, giving you the flexibility to adjust based on interest and participation levels. Start small, stay consistent, and scale up based on the results you get from each stage!
