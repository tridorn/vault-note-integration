# Using AI for Summarising in Science and Math

The main criticism (besides people hating me) was that this could not be applied to a math or a science, here is my theory and thought process on how it could be applied.  

[where the explanation starts, scroll down if you just want to see the prompt]

This was the Prompt I created/used for my specific English intensive course

"PROMPT:

Here is the exam criteria on my (post your class name)

(post what the professor said the exam will consist of and what to study, the criteria he said)

Your job is to tell me:

1. ⁠What is the lecture about

2. ⁠to highlight what is important to study based on the criteria and your own information.

3. ⁠Make a list of what is important to study based on the transcript

(where you now post the said transcript)

PROMPT END:

The formula set out to accomplish objectives that my method AIStudyBuddy wanted

1. Cut lecture watch time

2. Gather important information

3. Make it highlight what it thought it was important to study based on its ability to analyze

The result me engineering my prompt to accomplish these objectives had astonishing results

1. I cut 20-30 hours of lectures down to 5

2. Knew the main point of each lecture and what it's purpose was

3. Created a study guide based in the exam criteria

The success of my prompt engineering led me to get a total of 94% despite only really investing 3 days into my course.

The way that I would apply my method (AIStudyBuddy) to a different course specifically math, is by completely abandoning the prompts I created and seek to make a new prompt engineered on the basis of my objectives I created before (the prompts have to be course specific)

For math

1. It's important to recognize math it's a very step by step basis so you can't cut out information (this completely leaves out the concept of ai summarizer)

2. Recognize that math is formula dependent ( which means it's easier for the AI to differentiate between English and formula )

3. Recognize that chat gpt is effective at gathering information like math but not effectively applying it. ( don't ask it to do your math but where you went wrong )

The biggest issue is that my method wants to cut lecture watch time, but missing information is detrimental you can't miss the chance of potentially forgetting a step or everything including the formula falls apart. I don't have a solution to automate this, so I suggest manually pasting the transcript into google docs and cutting out the introduction, ending and questions with command F.

So with the (manually shortened transcript)

[where the explanation ends]

You can begin the prompt

PROMPT:

ChatGPT, your job is to:

1. Analyze this transcript and tell me what it's about

2. List each formula (or unique formula)used in the lecture

3. Explain each formula with an in-depth analysis BASED specifically on this transcript and (the course text book)

4. Then list the each formula in chronological order based on the amount of times it was used or mentioned in the transcript.( this is iffy but it might work for identifying what the prof spent the most time on)

(Post the Transcript)

PROMPT END

Note: [asking gpt to do 4 objectives dilutes the information it outputs, so maybe cut out some parts of the prompt]

PROMPT:

"ChatGPT, I want you to use generate questions that would align with (exam criteria).

These question have to be generated based on (these specific formulas)

You are only allowed to use (course textbook) to gather information to create these questions"

PROMPT END:

I didn't test this but I believe based in theory these prompts can set out for the objectives of my method AIStudyBuddy

1. Cut lecture watch time

2. Summarize information

3. Generate material akin to the exam

(NOTE: ai is not perfect, if it made a mistake inform it how it made a mistake and it will improve based on the information you provided it)
