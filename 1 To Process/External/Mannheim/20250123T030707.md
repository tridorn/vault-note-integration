Certainly, here is a central overview of the initiative and its structure based on our discussions:

---

### **The Initiative Overview:**

The initiative’s primary function is to act as a *data enabler* at the University of Mannheim, focusing on gathering student insights through polling, presenting engaging data (both playful and serious), and fostering a sense of community. The initiative will maintain a small core team responsible for the overarching infrastructure, while individual projects are executed by external teams on a project basis.

### **Core Components**

#### 1. **Mission And Focus**

	- To gather, analyze, and present data relevant to university life, providing insights that can drive cultural and institutional improvements.
	- To empower students to contribute to university culture by offering them tools and a platform to carry out their own data-driven projects.
	- To offer both playful, engagement-oriented data (such as weekly polls) and rigorous, project-based reports (for serious academic or practical applications).
	

#### 2. **Organizational Structure**

##### **Core Team (Enablers)**

	- **Size**: 5-10 members.
	- **Roles**:
	  - **Framework Providers**: Manage the infrastructure for weekly polling, maintain tools and data collection platforms, and ensure quality control.
	  - **Project Managers**: Oversee collaboration with external teams, assign tools, and ensure smooth execution of projects.
	  - **Common Task Executors**: Handle recurring tasks such as weekly polls, data collection, and presenting key data insights.
	- **Core Functions**:
	  - **Weekly Polling**: Design and run a weekly polling cycle, gathering data from the student body.
	  - **Data Presentation**: Present key findings from the weekly polls, with a mix of playful and serious topics.
	  - **Project Vetting**: Review and approve proposals from external teams, ensuring alignment with the initiative’s goals.
	  - **Tool Provision**: Provide external teams with templates, platforms, and methodology guidance for their projects.

##### **External Teams (Project-Based Collaboration)**

	- **Composition**: Students or other university initiatives that collaborate with the core team on a temporary, project-specific basis.
	- **Role**:
	  - Bring project ideas to the initiative, e.g., data collection for their own initiatives or personal academic projects.
	  - Execute data collection, analysis, and reporting with the help and guidance of the core team.
	  - Use initiative-provided tools, platforms, and templates to ensure consistency and quality.

### **Project Phases**

#### 1. **Polling (Data Collection)**

	- **Objective**: To collect data that reflects student sentiment and informs both playful engagement (e.g., humorous surveys) and serious academic or institutional reports.
	- **Weekly Polling**: A link with a set of weekly questions that gather data from the student body.
	- **Methodology**:
	  - Use structured, verified survey tools (e.g., Google Forms, Qualtrics) to gather quantitative and qualitative data.
	  - Weekly surveys to assess both serious and humorous topics.
	  - Verification via student email for authenticity.

#### 2. **Report Writing**

	- **Data Analysis**: The core team, along with external collaborators, analyzes the data gathered from the polls and presents it in a professional, rigorous manner.
	- **Formal Report Structure**:
	  - **Executive Summary**: Overview of findings and proposed solutions.
	  - **Methodology**: Explanation of data collection, including scope and sample size.
	  - **Findings**: Key insights from the data, using visualizations and statistical analysis.
	  - **Discussion**: Interpretation of the data, highlighting implications for the university or student body.
	  - **Recommendations**: Actionable steps for the university or initiatives based on the findings.
	  - **Conclusion**: Summary and next steps.

#### 3. **Pitching And Engagement**

	- **Presentation to Stakeholders**: After creating a report, the external team, supported by the core initiative, presents findings to relevant university stakeholders (administrators, student bodies, etc.).
	- **Pitch Structure**:
	  - Introduction to the problem.
	  - Data-driven insights (from the report).
	  - Proposed solutions and practical steps for implementation.
	  - Call to action for the stakeholders to support or adopt the proposed changes.

### **Formalized Processes**

#### **Core Workflow**

1. **Idea Submission**: A student or group presents an idea or need for data collection.
2. **Project Proposal Review**: The core team evaluates the project’s alignment with initiative goals and determines the resources required.
3. **Tool Provision**: The initiative provides the necessary survey tools, report templates, and guidance on methodology.
4. **Execution**: The external team executes the project, with oversight from the core team to ensure quality.
5. **Review**: The core team reviews the final report, ensuring it meets standards before publication.
6. **Presentation**: The project team pitches the findings to relevant stakeholders or publishes them for public dissemination.

### **Key Features of the Initiative**

1. **Student Empowerment**: External teams (students or initiatives) are empowered to execute their own projects using the framework provided by the initiative, gaining real-world experience in data analysis, report writing, and presenting findings.
	
2. **Playfulness and Engagement**: The initiative consistently engages the student body through light-hearted, humorous polls, maintaining a balance between academic rigor and campus culture. Playful perks (like the monocle privilege) and ironic titles enhance visibility and participation.
	
3. **Scalability**: The initiative’s structure is scalable, allowing it to expand its influence within the university and even nationwide. Each project is independently run, with minimal strain on the core team, and the initiative can grow through collaboration with student groups and university departments.

4. **Flexibility in Participation**: The project-based structure allows external teams to engage on a per-project basis, providing flexibility for students who wish to gain experience without committing to long-term involvement.

5. **Alignment with University Goals**: The initiative's work aligns with university priorities, such as improving student life, fostering sustainability, and enhancing institutional feedback mechanisms. Through its reports and presentations, it serves as a valuable resource for the university administration.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

1. **Quality Control**: To mitigate the risk of inconsistent output from external teams, the core team will implement a formal review process for all projects before they are published or pitched.
	
2. **Sustained Engagement**: The core team will focus on creative, engaging weekly polls and ensure diverse question topics to maintain student interest.

3. **Securing Administrative Buy-In**: Establishing early connections with university departments or student services can increase the legitimacy of the initiative and provide access to institutional resources.

### **Vision For Growth**

1. **National Expansion**: As the initiative proves successful at the University of Mannheim, it can be expanded to other universities under the same model, potentially under a consistent brand name (*BrauchtUM*, *BrauchtLMU*, etc.), maintaining both the playful and professional aspects of the initiative.
	
2. **Cross-Initiative Collaboration**: By establishing itself as the go-to source for data collection, analysis, and reporting, the initiative could become a key partner for other student-led initiatives, further entrenching itself in university culture.

This refined, structured framework ensures the initiative is both scalable and adaptable, allowing it to maintain a balance between rigorous academic output and engagement-driven contributions to student culture.
