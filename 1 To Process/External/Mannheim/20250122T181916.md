# Expanded Set-up

Your inquiry might have been phrased thus: “What additional technological platforms or services, such as video conferencing and ticketing/support systems, might be necessary for further enhancing the IT infrastructure of the student initiative?”

To further elaborate on what else might be needed to enhance AKB’s IT ecosystem, the following are additional vital components that can contribute to a holistic and forward-thinking infrastructure:

### **1. Video Conferencing and Live Streaming Platforms**

	**Goal**: Facilitate seamless online events, webinars, and team meetings for both internal and external members.

	- **Action**: Integrate a reliable video conferencing and live streaming solution to manage virtual meetings and large-scale events.
	- **Step-by-Step**:
	  1. **Zoom or Microsoft Teams**: These platforms are well-established and offer both free and paid plans for hosting video calls, webinars, and large-scale events. Set up an AKB-specific account and use their event scheduling features.
	  2. **Integration with Website/Portal**: Embed **Zoom** or **Teams** meeting links directly within your member portal, allowing attendees to register and join meetings from the same place they access other resources.
	  3. **Live Streaming for Events**: Utilize **YouTube Live** or **Twitch** to broadcast events to a broader audience, especially for significant educational or market analysis sessions. This could be streamed directly from the AKB member portal for an integrated experience.
	  4. **Recording and Archiving**: Record all webinars and events, making them available in a video library on the portal for members who couldn’t attend live. This can be done through YouTube’s unlisted videos feature, or with **Vimeo** for more professional handling of video content.

	- **Outcome**: Members will have access to seamless video meetings for both team collaboration and educational purposes. Recorded events will help maintain a repository of knowledge for later viewing.

### **2. Ticketing and Support System**

	**Goal**: Implement a structured support system to handle IT issues, member queries, and administrative requests efficiently.

	- **Action**: Introduce a ticketing system for managing internal IT issues and general member support.
	- **Step-by-Step**:
	  1. **Helpdesk Software**: Use a free or low-cost ticketing platform like **Freshdesk**, **Zoho Desk**, or **HelpScout** to manage internal IT and member support tickets. You can set up different ticket categories for IT issues, membership queries, or event support.
	  2. **Slack Integration**: Integrate the ticketing system with **Slack**, so that team members get notifications when new tickets are raised or resolved.
	  3. **Automation**: Automate ticket assignments based on categories and priority levels. For instance, critical IT infrastructure issues can be flagged as urgent, while general membership queries can have a lower priority.
	  4. **Knowledge Base**: Set up an FAQ or knowledge base section that addresses common IT issues, event registration problems, and membership queries. You can embed this within your existing portal using tools like **Zendesk** or a plugin like **BetterDocs** for WordPress.

	- **Outcome**: The ticketing system will ensure organized handling of IT-related issues and member inquiries. Members and team members will have a clear way to seek support, improving the initiative's efficiency.

### **3. Task Automation and Workflow Management**

	**Goal**: Streamline and automate repetitive administrative tasks such as event reminders, member onboarding, and meeting scheduling.

	- **Action**: Set up automated workflows to handle routine tasks, reducing the manual workload.
	- **Step-by-Step**:
	  1. **Zapier Integration**: Use **Zapier** to connect different platforms (e.g., Google Sheets, Slack, email) and automate common tasks. For example, you can automate sending a welcome email whenever a new member registers on the portal.
	  2. **Google Calendar Integration**: Sync the initiative’s events with **Google Calendar** or similar platforms, allowing members to receive automatic reminders and updates on upcoming events or deadlines.
	  3. **Trello Automation**: Automate task assignments and progress updates in **Trello** using its built-in automation tool, **Butler**, which can trigger actions based on due dates or task completion.

	- **Outcome**: By automating mundane administrative tasks, the initiative can operate more smoothly and efficiently, freeing up time for strategic work.

### **4. Document Management System**

	**Goal**: Create a centralized document repository for reports, financial statements, educational materials, and event-related documents.

	- **Action**: Implement a cloud-based document management system for storing, sharing, and collaborating on documents.
	- **Step-by-Step**:
	  1. **Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive**: Use **Google Drive** or **Microsoft OneDrive** to store all internal documents, ensuring easy access and sharing among team members.
	  2. **Folder Structure**: Organize documents into clearly defined folders such as "Finance", "Events", "IT Documentation", and "Educational Resources".
	  3. **Version Control**: Ensure that documents are versioned so that changes can be tracked, and previous versions can be recovered if necessary.
	  4. **Access Control**: Set appropriate access controls, with certain documents restricted to specific roles within the initiative (e.g., financial documents viewable only by the finance team).

	- **Outcome**: The initiative will have a streamlined and organized document repository, making collaboration and information retrieval easier for everyone involved.

### **5. Financial and Budget Management Tools**

	**Goal**: Provide transparent and structured management of AKB’s financial activities, including budgeting, member dues, and expenses.

	- **Action**: Use a financial management platform to handle all of the initiative’s financial activities.

	  1. **QuickBooks or Zoho Books**: Use **QuickBooks** or **Zoho Books** for handling the initiative’s financial transactions. These tools can manage invoices, expenses, and budgeting.
	  2. **Integration with Member Portal**: For member dues or event fees, integrate a payment gateway (e.g., **Stripe** or **PayPal**) into the member portal, so members can pay directly online, with all transactions logged automatically in the financial system.
	  3. **Reports**: Generate monthly or quarterly financial reports that can be shared with key stakeholders to ensure transparency and responsible financial management.

	- **Outcome**: AKB’s financial operations will be structured, transparent, and easily manageable, ensuring compliance and clarity in all fiscal matters.

### **6. Member Engagement and Feedback Collection**

	**Goal**: Maintain high engagement by collecting feedback and ensuring members feel their voice is heard.

	- **Action**: Set up feedback collection tools to monitor member satisfaction and gather input for future improvements.

	  2. **Slack Polls**: You can also integrate polls within **Slack** channels to gather quick opinions on internal decisions, event ideas, or member satisfaction.
	  3. **Data Analysis**: Regularly analyze the feedback to make informed decisions on improving the initiative’s offerings or internal processes.

	- **Outcome**: By collecting feedback, you’ll be able to adjust to the needs and preferences of AKB members, ensuring high levels of engagement and satisfaction.

### **7. Mobile App Development**

	**Goal**: Enhance user experience by making AKB’s resources and tools accessible through a dedicated mobile app.

	- **Action**: Use a no-code mobile app platform to develop an AKB-specific app for members.
	- **Step-by-Step**:
	  1. **AppGyver or Glide**: Use a no-code app development platform like **AppGyver** or **Glide** to create a basic mobile app where members can check events, register for webinars, access financial resources, and even participate in stock simulations.

	- **Action**: Document all IT systems and create a robust handover process for future IT leads.
	- **Step-by-Step**:
	  1. **Documentation**: Use your knowledge-sharing platform (e.g., Wiki.js or Google Docs) to fully document the entire IT setup, including how to manage cloud infrastructure, handle member data, and troubleshoot common issues.
	  2. **Training**: Set up a training program for future IT leads, ensuring they understand the critical systems and workflows.
	  3. **Regular Reviews**: Conduct yearly or bi-yearly reviews of the IT infrastructure to ensure that everything remains up-to-date and in good working order.
