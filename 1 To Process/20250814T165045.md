Better: "Design a mobile, index-card based note system that integrates with a markdown library. Provide rationale, operating rules, file schema, card templates, review cadence, and failure modes."

  

# Rationale and trade-offs

  

Index cards outperform bound paper for capture and recombination. They force atomicity, can be re-sequenced instantly, and tolerate field use. Costs: higher fragmentation risk, scanning overhead, and loss risk. You offset these with strict IDs, a daily digitisation sweep, and a small carry discipline.

  

# System overview

  

Objective: analogue for cognition, digital for retrieval. One pipeline, two surfaces.

1. Capture on cards. One idea per card.

2. Distil the same day into a statement, evidence, and implication.

3. Encode to markdown with stable IDs and links.

4. Review using a simple Leitner box.

5. Reuse by pulling notes into projects and maps.

  

# Card taxonomy

  

Keep it minimal and action biased.

  

• Claim. Verifiable statement extracted from a source.

• Principle. Cross-context rule that guides choices.

• Pattern. Situation → response that tends to work.

• Metric. Definition, formula, guardrail.

• Play. Stepwise tactic you can execute.

• Counterexample. Where a rule fails and why.

• Question. Open issue tied to a decision.

• Quote. Only when wording materially matters.

  

# Card layout

  

Front is for thinking. Back is for indexing and next action.
    
    
    Front
    [Title, 3--6 words]
    Statement:
    Evidence:
    Implication:
    
    Back
    ID: YYDOY-SS   Type: claim|principle|...
    Source: src-book|paper|pod|meet + locator
    Tags: 2--4 controlled terms
    Links: note IDs or project IDs
    Status: inbox | distilled | encoded | applied
    Next: action, owner, date

Example ID format: YYDOY-SS, where DOY is day-of-year and SS is a two-digit sequence. Example: 25227-03. This is fast to write in pen. You expand to a full timestamp during encoding.

  

# Edge coding for speed

  

Use corner marks so you can sort without reading.

  

• Top right dot = Principle.

• Top left slash = Pattern.

• Bottom right square = Metric.

• Bottom left triangle = Question.

• Right edge notch = "Action present".

  

Do not add colours. Shape markers are enough and reproducible anywhere.

  

# Physical workflow

  

Boxes, not piles. Three compartments in one slip box.

  

• Inbox. Fresh cards.

• Active. Distilled today, awaiting encoding.

• Review. Cards in Leitner slots 1 to 5.

  

Daily carry: one pocket sleeve with 20 blank cards, 10 active, fine pen, one binder clip. Hard cap: carry at most 30 cards.

  

# Encoding and markdown library

  

Single namespace. Stable, linkable, grep-friendly.

    ## Statement
    Customers reveal willingness to pay via fenced offers before packaging is final.
    
    ## Evidence
    Interview set A (n=8) showed three clusters reacting to the same fence at different price points.
    
    ## Implication
    Design two packages that separate urgent buyers without discounting core value.
    
    ## Action
    Run landing test with two fences. Targets: CTR ≥ 2.5 percent, qualified reply rate ≥ 10 percent.

# Review cadence

  

Leitner box with five slots. Review only notes that affect decisions.

  

• New card enters Slot 1.

• Correct recall or confirmed use moves to the next slot.

• Failure or irrelevance moves back to Slot 1 or to archive.

• Intervals: Slot 1 daily, Slot 2 every 3 days, Slot 3 weekly, Slot 4 bi-weekly, Slot 5 monthly.

• Cap the "rehearsing" set at 20 notes. If a note never drives an action in two months, demote it.

  

# Reading protocol for two books per week

  

Per chapter or per hour, keep at most 10 cards. Maintain scarcity.

  

Day 1 reading

• Capture 30 to 60 cards across both books. Mark types with corner codes.

• Mark two "Play" cards per chapter minimum.

  

Day 2 distillation

• Choose the best 10 cards per book. Write statement, evidence, implication.

• Encode those 20 into markdown. Link each to one project or map.

  

Day 3 application

• Execute one Play from each book in a live context. Record outcomes in the note footer.

• Move applied cards to Slot 2 in the Leitner box.

  

Half day synthesis

• Update each source dossier with a 200-word synthesis and three links to your maps.

• Cull three weak notes per book.

  

# Operating constraints that keep it sharp

  

• Hard cap: 10 kept notes per chapter or per hour of audio.

• For every five notes created, one Play must be scheduled in a real project.

• Quote density under 10 percent. Paraphrase to think.

• If a card is not encoded within 72 hours, it returns to Inbox and is up for deletion.

• Weekly merge pass. Delete duplicates, keep the stronger evidence chain, redirect links.

  

# Integration rules

  

Tags are a closed list maintained in /maps/_tags.md. Use few, durable terms: strategy, pricing, segmentation, pmf, growth, experiment, analytics, ux, sales, negotiation, research, moat, ops. Links beat tags. Every project file pulls notes by link, never by copy.

  

# Metrics to audit the system

  

• Capture selectivity: kept cards divided by captured cards. Target 30 percent or less.

• Encode latency: median hours from card creation to markdown. Target under 48.

• Action ratio: Plays executed divided by Plays created. Target 60 percent plus.

• Retrieval speed: time to find three relevant notes for a live decision. Target under 2 minutes.

• Archive rate: percent of notes not touched in 60 days. Target 20 to 40, or your vault is bloated.

  

# Failure modes and fixes

  

• Card loss. Fix: daily photo sweep into _inbox, pocket sleeve, and a visible "cards carried" count on the sleeve.

• Fragmentation. Fix: weekly merge pass and strict linking into maps.

• Over-capture. Fix: enforce per-chapter caps and a cull rule.

• Scanning drag. Fix: photograph, do not beautify. Type only the top notes.

• Tag sprawl. Fix: closed vocabulary and links first.

  

# Minimal kit that works anywhere

  

• Cards: 3x5 or A6, 180--220 gsm, dot grid.

• Sleeve: slim pocket case that holds 30 cards.

• Pen: fast-dry 0.5--0.7 gel or fine felt.

• Slip box: five-slot Leitner insert or three-slot divider.

• Stickers: weekly sheet of short IDs, PF-01 to PF-30. Write the full timestamp during encoding.

  

This gives you a medium-agnostic framework with tight control loops. Use cards for cognition, markdown for structure, and enforce the caps so the system stays fast under load.
