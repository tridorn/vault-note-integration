What you meant was:

> *I plan to launch a service via a website. How do I architect it to gracefully handle both high-traffic surges and low-traffic lulls? I want to avoid the common failure modes: game studios underestimating traffic and going offline at launch, or overpaying for idle servers in case the surge never comes.*

Here’s how it should be approached—scalability not as a luxury, but as a fundamental property of your system.

---

### **1. **Start with Cloud-Native Infrastructure**
Forget fixed servers. Go with a cloud provider that offers elastic scalability (AWS, GCP, Azure). Use services that **scale automatically** based on demand.

- **Use containers** (e.g., Docker) orchestrated by **Kubernetes** or **AWS ECS/EKS**.
- Pair with **auto-scaling groups** or **serverless compute** (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) when possible.

> *For an MVP with uncertain load: Serverless > Containers > Fixed VMs.*

---

### **2. Use a CDN for Static Assets**
Offload every asset you can (JS, CSS, images) to a **Content Delivery Network** (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, etc.).

- You now reduce load on origin servers.
- You get lower latency for users worldwide.

---

### **3. Set Up Load Balancers and Health Checks**
If you're not using serverless, use a **load balancer** (AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancing) that can:

- **Distribute traffic evenly** across instances.
- **Auto-scale horizontally** by triggering new instances when CPU/memory thresholds are hit.
- **Auto-recover** from failed instances.

---

### **4. Cache Aggressively**
Protect your backend with layered caching:

- **Edge caching** via CDN.
- **Application-level caching** (e.g., Redis or Memcached).
- **Database query caching** via read replicas or query result caching.

---

### **5. Queue the Bursts**
If you have **spiky workloads** (like registration emails, image processing, etc.)—**decouple them** using queues (Amazon SQS, RabbitMQ, etc.).

- This buffers spikes.
- Your system handles more concurrent users without choking on background jobs.

---

### **6. Use Feature Flags + Phased Rollouts**
Don’t launch to *everyone* at once.

- Use **feature flags** to turn things on gradually.
- Roll out access to 10%, then 25%, then 100%.
- Monitor performance + errors at each phase.

---

### **7. Monitor, Alert, Simulate**
Before launch:

- **Simulate load** using tools like k6, Artillery, or Locust.
- **Monitor everything** (Datadog, Grafana + Prometheus, CloudWatch).
- Set alerts on CPU, memory, 500 errors, and queue sizes.

---

### **8. Use Rate Limiting and Graceful Degradation**
You must be ready to **shed load** when overwhelmed:

- Rate-limit or queue non-essential operations.
- Show informative messages, retry later, etc.
- Example: Stripe degrades cleanly under pressure; most don’t.

---

### **9. Pay-for-Load Design**
Align cost with traffic:

- Choose billing models like **per-request (serverless)** or **auto-scaled VMs**.
- Don’t pre-allocate 10 servers; **earn the surge** as it comes.

---

### **10. Prepare for the “Success Disaster”**
Have a **“Break Glass” protocol**:

- If a product hunt post or influencer tweet explodes traffic, what do you do?
- Write an **emergency scalability playbook** before launch.
- Include contact lists, cooldown strategies, and manual scale override steps.
