### **AMU Operations Handbook**

---

### **1. Overview of AMUs**

An **Adaptive Mission Unit (AMU)** is a **cross-functional, autonomous team** tasked with achieving a specific mission. Each AMU operates independently but is aligned with the company’s larger goals, receiving **strategic objectives** from the **Leadership Council** and support from **Operational Command Divisions (OCDs)**. AMUs are designed to be flexible, operating much like **military units** that can adapt quickly to changing conditions while remaining mission-focused.

### **Core Characteristics of AMUs:**

- **Mission-Driven:** Each AMU has a **specific, clear mission**, often tied to strategic goals set by the Leadership Council.
- **Autonomous Decision-Making:** AMUs have the freedom to **make decisions on the ground** without needing constant oversight or approval.
- **Cross-Functional:** An AMU includes members with **diverse skill sets**—from engineering and design to marketing and sales—ensuring the team can handle all aspects of the mission.
- **Iterative and Agile:** AMUs work in **short cycles (Sprints)**, continuously iterating and adjusting based on feedback, data, and evolving circumstances.

### **3. Lifecycle of an AMU**

AMUs operate in a structured, **mission-based cycle** designed to ensure clarity, adaptability, and continuous improvement. Here’s how an AMU lifecycle typically unfolds:

#### **Phase 1: Mission Assignment**

- The AMU is assigned a **mission** by the Leadership Council or the Chief Strategy Officer. The mission includes:
  - **Clear objectives** and expected outcomes.
  - **Key performance indicators (KPIs)** to track success.
  - A **timeline** and key milestones.
- Example: “Develop and launch a new product feature within 6 months to increase user engagement by 20%.”

#### **Phase 2: Mission Planning**

- **Kickoff meeting**: The AMU gathers to review the mission and **align on the goals and approach**.
- **Mission Planner** and **AMU Leader** work together to break the mission down into **milestones** and **deliverables**.
- The **Mission Planner** sets the **Sprint cadence** (typically 1-2 week cycles) and organizes the backlog of tasks.
- **Logistics Coordinator** identifies resource needs and starts requesting support from OCDs.

#### **Phase 3: Execution and Sprints**

- The team begins **executing in sprint cycles**, working towards each **milestone**.
- Each sprint involves:
  1. **Daily stand-ups** (short, focused meetings) to review progress, identify roadblocks, and reprioritize tasks if needed.
  2. **Sprint reviews** at the end of each cycle, assessing what was accomplished, gathering feedback, and adjusting the next sprint accordingly.
- **Intelligence Officer** provides real-time data and insights from the Intelligence Command Centre, ensuring that decisions are **informed and data-driven**.

#### **Phase 4: Iteration and Feedback**

- After each sprint, the team reviews **performance against KPIs**, gathers feedback from **customers or stakeholders**, and makes adjustments.
- The **AMU Leader** facilitates these review sessions, making sure the team remains focused on the mission goals while iterating and improving on each cycle.
- **LFOs (Leadership Field Officers)** may step in to provide **guidance** and unblock any challenges the AMU is facing during the execution phase.

#### **Phase 5: Completion and Debrief**

- Once the mission is complete, the AMU holds a **final review**:
  1. What were the **key successes**?
  2. What **challenges** did the team face, and how were they overcome?
  3. What **lessons were learned** that can be applied to future missions?
- **Debrief reports** are compiled and shared with the Leadership Council, **Operational Command Divisions**, and **Intelligence Command Centre** to inform future missions.
- The AMU can either **disband** or evolve to take on a **new mission**, depending on the company’s needs.

### **4. Key Operational Practices for AMUs**

#### **A. Agile Methodologies**

- AMUs operate using **agile methodologies**, meaning work is broken down into short, iterative cycles that emphasize **speed, flexibility**, and **constant feedback**.
  - **Sprints**: 1-2 week work cycles focused on specific deliverables.
  - **Stand-ups**: Short, daily meetings to track progress, address blockers, and ensure the team is aligned.
  - **Retrospectives**: End-of-sprint meetings to assess what went well, what didn’t, and how the team can improve in the next cycle.

#### **B. Autonomous Decision-Making**

- AMUs are empowered to make **real-time decisions** without needing approval from the Leadership Council for every choice. This ensures:
  - **Fast responses** to challenges and market changes.
  - High levels of **team accountability** for mission success.
  - **Ownership** of the outcomes, both good and bad, fostering a strong sense of **team responsibility**.

#### **C. Data-Driven Execution**

- The **Intelligence Officer** ensures that the team always has access to the **latest data and insights** from the Intelligence Command Centre. This enables the AMU to:
  - Make decisions based on **quantitative data** rather than guesswork.
  - Quickly identify when something isn’t working and adjust strategies accordingly.
  - Align execution with **customer feedback, market trends**, and **performance metrics**.

#### **D. Real-Time Resource Allocation**

- **Logistics Coordinators** collaborate with **Operational Command Divisions** to ensure that the AMU has access to the resources (e.g., technology, materials, personnel) it needs at all times.
  - Resources are requested on an **on-demand basis**, meaning AMUs don’t have to wait for lengthy approval processes.
  - Requests to the OCDs (e.g., for IT support, new hires, materials) are streamlined to ensure **operational

 efficiency**.

### **5. Communication Practices Within AMUs**

#### **A. Internal Communication:**

- **Daily stand-ups**: AMUs hold short, focused stand-ups (10-15 minutes) at the start of each day to:
  - Review what was accomplished the day before.
  - Identify any **roadblocks**.
  - Plan the day’s tasks and re-prioritize if necessary.
- **Collaboration platforms**: Use platforms like **Slack, Teams**, or **Trello** to maintain transparent, asynchronous communication between members.
  - Teams should be able to see **task ownership** and **progress** at all times.
  - Clear **document sharing** and **updates** on ongoing tasks.

#### **B. External Communication:**

- **Reports to LFOs**: The AMU Leader maintains periodic communication with the LFOs to:
  - Report on progress and **key milestones**.
  - Identify potential areas where **cross-AMU collaboration** may be beneficial.
- **Feedback to Leadership Council**: Key findings and strategic shifts are reported back to the Leadership Council during **Sprint reviews** or as needed, particularly when major challenges or unexpected opportunities arise.

### **6. AMU Performance and Accountability**

AMU performance is tracked continuously, with accountability embedded in every phase of the mission lifecycle. Success is measured against **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** that align with the mission objectives.

#### **A. Tracking KPIs:**

- **AMU Leaders** and the **Mission Planner** set clear KPIs at the outset of the mission, including:
  - **Quantitative metrics** (e.g., revenue targets, product launch dates, user acquisition rates).
  - **Qualitative goals** (e.g., user satisfaction, product quality).
- **Regular KPI Reviews**: Each sprint ends with a **review of KPI progress**, allowing the AMU to assess whether they are on track to meet their goals and make course corrections if necessary.

#### **B. Accountability Mechanisms:**

- **Ownership of Outcomes**: Every team member is accountable for their part in the mission. This includes:
  - Taking responsibility for failures and learning from mistakes.
  - Recognizing and celebrating key milestones and achievements.
- **Post-Mission Reviews**: After each mission, a **debrief** session is held to review the outcomes, gather lessons learned, and compile a report for the Leadership Council, informing future missions and operational adjustments.

### **7. Scaling AMUs for Growth**

As the company grows, the AMU structure can be scaled without losing the **agility** and **flexibility** that define it. Here’s how scaling is managed:

#### **A. Creating Nested AMUs:**

- For larger projects or broader company initiatives, **nested AMUs** may be created. These are essentially **sub-units** of an AMU that operate on **specific aspects** of the larger mission.
  - For example, a market expansion AMU may have **sub-AMUs** focused on product localization, sales outreach, and marketing strategy.

#### **B. Resource Sharing Across AMUs:**

- AMUs are encouraged to share knowledge, resources, and **best practices** with other units, fostering a **collaborative ecosystem** rather than isolated teams.
  - **Cross-AMU collaboration** is facilitated by the **Leadership Field Officers (LFOs)**, who help AMUs identify opportunities for working together and sharing resources.

#### **C. Flexible AMU Membership:**

- Team members can be moved between AMUs depending on **project needs** or **mission priorities**. This ensures that teams remain **dynamic** and **responsive** to the company’s broader goals.
  - **Rotating leadership** roles within AMUs ensures leadership development and keeps the team fresh and adaptive.
