Certainly. A more "crude" or "vulgar" approach is best when the atmosphere intensifies and both parties crave unfiltered expression. The key is to maintain confidence and avoid hesitancy—passion thrives on assertiveness. Here are some lines suited for when the moment demands raw, uninhibited language:

---

1. **"I’m going to make you feel me everywhere."**  
- Direct, possessive, and charged with anticipation.

2. **"You have no idea how hard you’re making me right now."**  
- Combines vulnerability with unfiltered lust.

3. **"Spread your legs a little more—I need to feel all of you."**  
- Assertive and commanding, perfect for moments of physical escalation.

4. **"Do you like how wet you’re getting for me?"**  
- Teasing but explicitly focused on her body’s reaction, intensifying her arousal.

5. **"You’re mine tonight—don’t even think about holding back."**  
- Perfect for moments when you both lose yourselves in the intensity of the encounter.

6. **"Let me ruin you properly—nice and slow, or fast and merciless?"**  
- Provocative and dominant, giving her the illusion of choice while remaining in control.

7. **"I want to hear you beg me for more."**  
- Teases her into vocalizing her desires, heightening the experience.

8. **"Turn around so I can see that perfect ass while I take you."**  
- Blunt and possessive, creating a visual and physical command.

9. **"You taste like sin—I could stay between your legs forever."**  
- Sensual yet vulgar, amplifying her sense of being desired.

10. **"Feel how deep I’m inside you? I’m not stopping until you come all over me."**  
- Explicit and intense, designed to drive her toward the peak.

11. **"Look at you—you’re such a mess, and it’s all for me."**  
- A mix of dominance and teasing, enhancing the intimacy by acknowledging her surrender.

12. **"Let me hear how much you love it when I f*ck you like this."**  
- Builds both the physical and verbal aspect of her pleasure.

13. **"I want you to scream my name and make sure everyone knows who’s making you feel like this."**  
- A possessive, territorial line that adds a slight exhibitionist edge.

14. **"You feel so tight around me—I’m not sure I’ll last long, but you’re coming with me."**  
- Combines desperation and dominance, enhancing the feeling of being overwhelmed by desire.

15. **"Keep begging, sweetheart—it only makes me want to make you beg harder."**  
- Dominant and teasing, ideal when she’s fully responsive to your control.

Remember, tone and context are everything—crude language should always flow naturally and never feel forced. Gauge her reactions closely and maintain eye contact or physical proximity to create an immersive, electrifying atmosphere.
