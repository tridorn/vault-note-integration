Structure the maps logical (for example leadership map) but provide customised advice on specific cases, such as For a University student. As the components of the maps should be modular, these specific scenarios could then create a customised arrangement of subtopics.  
This arrangement would allow to create any kind of special cases that would allow for customised solution (such as for the initiative AKB on improving their IT infrastructure)
