### Digital Enablement Portfolio

A conservative, low-complexity catalog suitable for sceptical German SMEs. Offers are arranged in ascending scope; each can stand alone or ladder into the next.

#### 1 Clarity Audit

*What you do*
• One structured interview with the Geschäftsführer and one process owner.
• Transcript extraction with GPT-4o.
• Process mapping in Notion: actors, tools, hand-offs, cycle times.
• Quantification of waste in hours, error risk, and implicit cost.
• Ten-page PDF plus a five-minute Loom walkthrough.

*Value delivered*
The owner sees a monetised view of hidden inefficiencies and a ranked list of remedial actions. Typical time recovery: 8-15 h per month.

*Price anchor*
€1 200 fixed fee. Equivalent to two consultant days at €600, a rate already accepted under German digitalisation grants. ([y-im.de][1])

---

#### 2 Blueprint Package

*What you do*
• Translate the Audit findings into a future-state workflow.
• Create a Notion workspace with SOPs, role checklists, and version control.
• Configure one lightweight automation (e.g. invoice filing to DATEV or Outlook triage).
• Deliver a one-hour staff onboarding call and a video tutorial library.

*Value delivered*
A single source of truth replaces Word chaos; manual tasks drop; audit-readiness improves. Adoption requires no IT department.

*Price range*
€5 000–8 000 depending on headcount and number of SOPs. Benchmarked against typical Mittelstand consulting day rates of €760–900. ([digitalisierung-fuer-den-mittelstand.de][2])

---

#### 3 Automation Sprint

*What you do*
• Identify one repetitive process with calculable ROI (e.g. offer-to-invoice sequence).
• Build Make.com or Zapier flows and a secure data hand-off to existing ERP or DATEV.
• Implement alerting and fallback logging.
• Provide rollback documentation.

*Value delivered*
Removes 30–60 minutes of clerical work per transaction and reduces error probability.

*Price range*
€3 500–6 000 per automated process, which undercuts the funded “go-digital” ceiling of €1 100 per consultant day while staying within subsidy thresholds. ([mittelstandsberater.de][3])

---

#### 4 KPI Dashboard

*What you do*
• Extract key metrics from CSV exports or SQL views.
• Build a serverless dashboard (Metabase Lite or Supabase + Datawrapper).
• Generate an auto-emailed PDF brief with GPT commentary every Monday at 07:00.
• Train one staff member to maintain data sources.

*Value delivered*
The owner receives board-level visibility without Excel consolidation; decisions accelerate.

*Price range*
Setup €4 000. Monthly maintenance €750. Notion or dashboard SaaS costs are pass-through at €8–12 per user. ([Notion][4], [House of Spaces][5])

---

#### 5 Run-Ops Retainer

*What you do*
Continuous support: quarterly SOP revision, automation health check, metric expansion, user training. Scope capped at eight service hours per month.

*Value delivered*
Ensures the digital backbone remains current, compliant, and staff-proof.

*Price range*
€1 000–2 000 per month, depending on system complexity and staff count.

### Pricing logic

1. Entry price ≤ €1 500 lowers the trust barrier while aligning with subsidised day-rates.
2. Implementation packages are value-priced below the €20 000 threshold that triggers heavy procurement.
3. Retainers convert capex to predictable opex and protect the asset you installed.

This portfolio keeps your own workload within seven billable hours per engagement, leverages AI for draft generation, and preserves 60 – 70 percent gross margin after a €150 design subcontract per report.
