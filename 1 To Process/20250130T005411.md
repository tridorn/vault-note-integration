In the initial stages of the **IEHN Protocol**, your focus should be singularly on diminishing resistance rather than diving directly into full study sessions. This emphasis on resistance reduction over task completion is crucial for reconditioning your psychological response to the act of studying itself.

### **Protocol Guidance for Initial Micro-Action Repetition**

1. **Focus on Resistance, Not Results**: If the goal is to lower resistance, attempting a full study session too soon could inadvertently trigger the very aversion you’re working to dissolve. By maintaining your focus on micro-actions alone, you allow your brain to associate the study setup with ease, low stakes, and even a bit of positive reinforcement (thanks to the dextrose reward).

2. **Accumulate Familiarity, Not Pressure**: Repeating micro-actions several times a day (like setting up your study space without diving into a full session) reinforces familiarity with the study environment and routine without the burden of productivity expectations. This familiarity is a cornerstone for reducing resistance in the long term.

3. **Gradual Progression to Actual Studying**: As you move into the **Intermediate Stage**—typically after a week of successfully performing micro-actions—begin to expand these small actions slightly. For example, once you feel genuine comfort with setting up your study space, you could progress to reading a single paragraph or jotting down a few notes as part of the micro-action. This step-by-step exposure keeps resistance at bay while introducing minor components of actual study.

### **Considerations For Variation and Adaptation**

However, if you feel a strong, spontaneous motivation to study after a few days of performing micro-actions, it’s entirely acceptable to engage with the material briefly. Yet, this engagement should remain light, without an expectation of sustained concentration or productivity. Treat it as an experiment in curiosity rather than an attempt to accomplish anything significant. This approach maintains the primary goal of reducing resistance while letting you “dip your toes” into study sessions if natural motivation arises.

### **Summary Guidance**

For now, focus strictly on the micro-actions and dextrose rewards. Commit to repeating this for a week without allowing yourself to move beyond these steps. After this period, begin incorporating slightly more challenging micro-actions gradually, only when you sense a genuine comfort with the prior stage. This restraint ensures that the foundation is deeply set before the pressure of studying builds up again, paving the way for smoother, low-resistance study habits.
