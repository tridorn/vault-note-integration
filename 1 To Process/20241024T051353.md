# Folders Don't Have to Follow Strict Naming Rules

--- 

## What Are Strict Naming Rules

Strict naming rules refer to the practice of giving files that are distributed via systems or the internet names that follow certain guidelines. No special characters for example, or a hierarchical structure to allow for sorting. A major point is also to use no white spaces.

## Why Folders Don't Have to Follow Them

The purpose of folders is not to be distributed to the other systems that possible don't support certain characters - instead they exist to bring order into the existing structure on the current system. Files naming following the strict guidelines can be quite unappealing, aesthetically. For the mentioned reason file folders don't have to be ugly, they can named freely and following their intended purpose.
