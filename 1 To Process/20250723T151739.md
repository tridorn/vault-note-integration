For me, it was about privacy, but mostly about **control**. I have 3 domains which are linked to Proton and SL.

_firstnamelastname.com_: domain linked to my proton account. It is my main, I will give it to people, but not systems.

_firstnamelastname.net_: with SimpleLogin, I have an alias for every system I use. This is for pretty much everything, especially if it is already linked to personal data (e.g. if it has my name, address, etc)

_random.com_: with SimpleLogin, this is for anything that I don't want directly associated with me (alt accounts, etc.)

Using custom domains is less private as it is easier to track me down. However, this allows me to be independent from any service. I could move my emails and alias to other systems and I would not have to change everything. And, I have catch-all with SL so I don't have to manually create every alias which is nice.

Using your own domain does decrease your anonymity. If you are concerned about that, you can get 2 domains - one for services/people where you use your real identity, and another one for everything else.

Or just use the normal shared domain aliases. That's fine as long as you're okay with the vendor lock-in risk of making yourself dependent on Proton Pass.
