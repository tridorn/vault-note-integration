Western universities have become **hotbeds of post-colonial thought** for several interwoven reasons, ranging from **intellectual trends, ideological shifts, institutional dynamics, and the moral psychology of self-criticism**. In many ways, these universities **do turn against their own countries the most**, but this is not accidental—rather, it is a deliberate product of historical, political, and academic developments.  

---

### **1. The Legacy of the 1960s: The Radicalization of Academia**
- The **1960s saw a cultural and political revolution** in the West, with universities becoming centers of anti-war, anti-imperialist, and civil rights movements.  
- Many of today’s **tenured professors were students or intellectual heirs of this era**, and their ideological framework has **shaped entire disciplines**.  
- The Vietnam War, decolonization movements, and U.S. interventionism led to a shift:  
  - The **West was no longer seen as a beacon of freedom**, but as an **imperialist aggressor**.  
  - Marxist and post-colonial theories gained traction as **moral frameworks** for understanding global power dynamics.  

---

### **2. The Post-Colonial Turn: The West as the Villain**
- **Post-colonial theory**, largely developed in the late 20th century, **reinterprets Western history** not as a story of progress, but as one of **oppression, exploitation, and subjugation**.  
- Intellectuals like **Edward Said (Orientalism), Frantz Fanon (The Wretched of the Earth), and Gayatri Spivak** framed **Western dominance as inherently violent and corrupt**.  
- **The narrative shifted from "Western civilization as an ideal" to "Western civilization as a global oppressor."**  
- This meant that:
  - **Every Western success** (industrialization, democracy, scientific advancement) could be framed as built on **colonial exploitation**.
  - **Every non-Western struggle** could be blamed on **Western imperialism**, rather than internal failures.

---

### **3. Universities as Centers of Self-Criticism**
- **The West’s strength lies in self-reflection, but this has been weaponized.**  
  - Unlike authoritarian societies (e.g., China, Russia, or many post-colonial states), Western institutions allow **self-criticism**.  
  - Universities, as intellectual spaces, have **pushed this to an extreme**, making self-critique **the dominant mode of thought**.  
  - **"Critical Theory"** has replaced traditional scholarship in many humanities and social sciences fields.  
- The result?  
  - **Western history is scrutinized more than any other civilization.**  
  - **Imperial Japan, Ottoman slavery, Chinese colonization of Tibet, or Arab conquests get little attention**, because they do not fit the dominant **West-as-the-villain narrative**.

---

### **4. Institutional Capture by Left-Wing Ideologies**
- **Universities have become overwhelmingly left-wing, especially in the humanities and social sciences.**  
  - Surveys show that in many U.S. and European universities, **left-wing faculty outnumber conservatives by 10:1 or more**.  
  - Academia rewards **critiquing power structures**, which in a Western context means critiquing **one's own society**.
  - The **revolving door between academia, media, and activism** means that these ideas spread **beyond classrooms into policymaking and cultural discourse**.
- The humanities and social sciences are particularly dominated by **"critical" perspectives**, such as:  
  - **Critical Race Theory** (U.S. history is defined by racial oppression).  
  - **Post-Colonial Studies** (Western history is defined by exploitation).  
  - **Queer Theory, Feminist Theory, and Marxist Theory** (Western structures are inherently oppressive).  

---

### **5. The Moral Incentive: Why Attack the West?**
- **Criticizing one’s own society brings prestige, while criticizing others invites accusations of racism or imperialism.**  
  - A scholar **attacking Western colonialism** will be rewarded.  
  - A scholar **criticizing China’s treatment of Tibetans or the Uyghurs** might be labeled **Islamophobic, Sinophobic, or "pushing Western propaganda."**  
  - A scholar investigating **African, Middle Eastern, or Asian atrocities** risks being accused of **"reinforcing Western superiority."**  
- This moral asymmetry ensures that Western academics focus **inward** while **ignoring or downplaying non-Western atrocities**.

---

### **6. Funding & Globalization of Anti-Western Narratives**
- **Western universities receive heavy funding from foreign nations, many of whom have an interest in promoting anti-Western narratives.**  
  - **China funds Confucius Institutes** that spread its preferred narratives in Western universities.  
  - **Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE** fund Middle Eastern Studies programs that promote **anti-Western, pro-Islamist narratives**.  
- At the same time, **Western governments and corporations have little incentive to fund pro-Western scholarship**.  
  - No one **funds a "Defense of the West" program.**  
  - Instead, money flows into **identity politics, post-colonial studies, and critical race theory**, which all reinforce an **anti-Western bias**.

---

### **7. The Youth Factor: Radicalization in the Digital Age**
- **Young students are naturally idealistic and drawn to “revolutionary” ideas.**  
  - They are told that **the West is uniquely evil** and that their role is to “dismantle” its structures.  
  - Many arrive at university with **limited historical knowledge** and absorb these narratives uncritically.  
- Social media amplifies **activist-driven narratives** over nuanced discussion.  
  - Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram reward **anger, outrage, and activism**, not deep scholarship.  
  - Complex conflicts (like the Middle East or global history) are **simplified into victim-oppressor binaries**.

---

### **8. Universities Have Become Detached from Their Own Nations**
- **Western universities no longer see themselves as serving their own countries.**  
  - In previous eras, universities educated students **to serve their nation**, whether in science, governance, or philosophy.  
  - Today, many elite institutions see themselves as part of an **internationalist, post-nationalist movement**, detached from Western national identity.  
  - **They have become the strongest voices against their own societies** while ignoring or excusing **non-Western authoritarianism**.

---

### **Conclusion: The Paradox of Western Self-Hatred**
- **Western universities have become centers of post-colonial, anti-Western ideology because they prioritize self-criticism, have been ideologically captured, and face structural incentives that reward attacking their own societies while ignoring others.**  
- This has created a **deep paradox**:  
  - Only the **West allows such open, radical criticism of itself**—a sign of **strength**, yet its critics treat it as a sign of weakness.  
  - Post-colonial theory **claims to "deconstruct power," yet has become the dominant power in academia itself**.  
  - **Students are taught to hate their own civilization while romanticizing others—without being encouraged to compare them fairly.**  

Ultimately, Western universities have **turned against their own societies the most because they can**—and because doing so is now **institutionally, socially, and financially rewarded**.
