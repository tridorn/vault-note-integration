Alright — let’s zoom out and paint the whole picture so you can see how these “weekend projects” fit into a longer-term, money-making strategy without losing your vibe-coding momentum.

⸻

1. What these projects actually are

You’re not building enterprise-grade SaaS right now. You’re:
	•	Running tiny experiments in the wild to see if an idea attracts attention and money.
	•	Treating launch as part of the build — not as something that happens 6 months later.
	•	Minimizing sunk cost by scoping to 1–2 days of development, then letting real users (not your friends) decide if it’s worth more work.

Think of each as a “micro-product”:
	•	Could be fun or quirky, but always solves something specific.
	•	Cheap to run.
	•	Disposable if it doesn’t hit.

⸻

2. Domain strategy — how to keep it sane

You have three realistic options:

Option A — One “umbrella” brand
	•	You buy one main domain for yourself or your “studio” (e.g., yourname.dev or cooltools.xyz).
	•	Each project is hosted on a subdomain:
	•	project1.cooltools.xyz
	•	project2.cooltools.xyz
	•	Pros: Cheap, fast to launch, your name builds with every experiment.
	•	Cons: If you sell a project later, you’ll need to transfer it to its own domain.

Option B — New domain per project
	•	Each micro-product gets its own .com/.app.
	•	Pros: Looks standalone and professional from day one, easy to sell or spin off.
	•	Cons: $10–$30/year each, more setup time, you’ll end up with a graveyard of unused domains.

Option C — Hybrid
	•	Test new projects under your main brand domain (newtool.myname.dev).
	•	If one catches on, then buy it a dedicated domain and migrate.

💡 Most indie founders start with Option C — keeps costs low while still allowing breakout projects to graduate.

⸻

3. Branding — personal vs business
	•	Personal brand (yourname.dev) works best early because:
	•	You get credit for all experiments, even failures.
	•	Early adopters follow you, not just a product.
	•	You can pivot niches without redoing the brand.
	•	Business brand (e.g., cooltools.co) makes sense if:
	•	You already know your target audience and want a cohesive theme.
	•	You plan to hire or bring in collaborators quickly.

💡 In vibe-coding mode, personal brand wins — you’re building a public reputation for “shipping useful things fast.”

4. Lifecycle of a micro-product

Here’s the lean cycle you can repeat monthly (or faster):
	1.	Spark: You see a problem or idea that’s easy to scope.
	2.	Build: 1–2 days of work. AI + templates to get it done fast.
	3.	Launch: Deploy, connect payment, post to one main channel.
	4.	Observe: Leave it live for 2–4 weeks:
	•	Watch traffic (PostHog, Plausible).
	•	Watch conversions (Stripe dashboard).
	•	Capture any support requests/emails.
	5.	Decide:
	•	Double down → If there’s steady usage or sales, add polish + features + maybe its own domain.
	•	Kill or mothball → If no traction, stop marketing it, but leave it up with low-cost hosting.
	•	Archive → If it’s dead, shut it down entirely (keep the domain parked or drop it at renewal).

💡 This “leave it running” phase is important. Weekend projects sometimes need a few weeks for traffic to trickle in.

5. Domain reuse & the graveyard

If a project dies:
	•	Option 1: Keep the domain parked for a year in case you reuse it.
	•	Option 2: Redirect it to your personal brand site (“This was an experiment, see my latest work at X”).
	•	Option 3: Let it expire if you’re sure it has no resale or reuse value.

Don’t fear a “graveyard” — the graveyard is your proof of iteration speed.

6. Marketing at micro scale
	•	No elaborate funnels.
	•	Just one short landing page that says:
	•	What it does.
	•	Who it’s for.
	•	How to start.
	•	Announce in the one place where your target user hangs out (a niche forum, Slack group, subreddit, X post).
	•	Share from your account (ties back to your personal brand).

Over time, you’ll get people following you for “whatever you launch next.”

7. How polished?

At micro-product stage:
	•	MUST:
	•	Mobile-friendly
	•	Fast load
	•	Clear headline & CTA
	•	Working payment + onboarding
	•	NICE-TO-HAVE:
	•	Logo (text-based is fine)
	•	About page
	•	Favicon
	•	NOT NEEDED YET:
	•	Fancy animations
	•	Custom illustration sets
	•	Full-featured help center

💡 Remember: your MVP is not a half-finished final product — it’s a complete but tiny product.

⸻

8. The bigger picture
	•	Think of yourself as running a micro-product lab.
	•	The goal is to ship a lot and see what sticks.
	•	Your “hit” might come from the 5th or 12th experiment.
	•	Every project:
	•	Improves your dev speed.
	•	Increases your audience.
	•	Could potentially make $ while you sleep.
	•	You only need one to hit to justify all the experiments.

If you want, I can map out a “micro-product lab” calendar — 12 weeks of experiments with domains, hosting, marketing, and sunset plan — so you’re not just building randomly but building in a rhythm that naturally produces paid opportunities.

Do you want me to sketch that out?
