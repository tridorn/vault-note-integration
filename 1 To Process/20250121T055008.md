# How to Run An Agency

- 1, 2, 3 to max 6 months on your own
- Find someone to hire as soon as possible
- Increase margins 
- Find someone to hire for a reasonable rate and charge more than that rate.
- Only have to manage that person, they get their pay, you your margins
- SPO (standardise) and continue to hire
- Increase margin and continue
- Once enough margin to hire senior manager, hire him to become you. Teach him everything that you would do until now, hiring, accounting, meetings, etc. 
- They become the operator 
- Goal is to reach this within the first year, first 365 days, this is how aggressive you should be
- Reason to have operator (as fast) is because you want to get out of the day to day as soon as possible to focus on the bigger picture, bigger clients, future expansion
