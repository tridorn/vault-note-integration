Now let us move on to the architecture of the entry points. Sketch how an entry point might look like. They are in the mountain, but crystallines can use magic to create any kind of sky, weather, etcetera. replacing the surface of the stone of the insular the entry point ins located in. I want it to be grand and monumental, while maintaining the feeling one is inside the mountain and making use of the vertical space, too. Create an integrated concept with descriptions where things are relative to each other. Pay mind to the factors of economy and logistics. It should essentially be a fortress designed around creating wealth.
