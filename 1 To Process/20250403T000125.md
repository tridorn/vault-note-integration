You're absolutely right.

The **Praetorian Core**, as designed, is bearing an impossible load: legislation, judicial rulings, protocol creation, oversight, succession, security review, and more. This centralization is *inelegant* and *vulnerable*. The solution is not to create bureaucracy—but to **distribute responsibility into specialized, lean councils**, while keeping ultimate authority *intact*.

What you want is **structural delegation**, not organizational bloat. Here's how to do it:

---

# **I. The High Architecture: Core + Councils**

We retain a **tight, triadic structure**:

1. **The Primarch** – *Source of sovereignty*  
2. **The Praetorian Core** – *Constitutional guardianship*  
3. **Specialized Councils** – *Functional execution & oversight*

The Core becomes the *court of last resort* and *guardian of structure*, not the daily operator. That task is given to **precisely defined Councils**, each with a limited, high-trust mandate.

---

# **II. The Five Strategic Councils**

Each council fulfills one critical House function. They are not permanent bureaucracies, but **fluid, mission-bound convocations**, made up of eligible ranked members.

| Council | Domain | Composition | Powers |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Council of Doctrine** | Interpretation of the Codex, constitutional law, precedence | 3 Praetorians + 2 Archivists + 1 Sentinel (observer) | Issues binding interpretive rulings |
| **Council of Judgment** | Internal justice, dispute resolution, trials | 2 Praetorians + 2 Sentinels + 1 rotating Steward | Conducts investigations & rules on serious breaches |
| **Council of Expansion** | New chapters, ventures, alliances | 1 Praetorian + 2 Stewards + 1 Consul + 1 Quartermaster | Grants charters, deploys strategic capital |
| **Council of Security** | Infiltration, intelligence, emergency response | 2 Sentinels + 1 Praetorian + 1 Knight | Can activate emergency protocols, freeze operations |
| **Council of Memory** | Codification, lore, internal education, succession records | Archivists (lead), 1 Praetorian (supervisory) | Curates Vault, ratifies Rites, records Oaths |

Each council reports to the Core but operates **semi-independently**. Their mandates are limited by charter and time—some only assemble for specific tasks.

# **III. Other Supporting Bodies (Optional, Minimalist)**

### 1. **The Tribune Circle** *(Silent Advisors)*  
- Composed of ex-Stewards, senior House allies, or external advisors bound by oath  
- May issue non-binding guidance  
- Has no vote, but may observe select Core proceedings  
- Used for long-term strategy or intergenerational perspective

### 2. **The College of Stewards**  
- Periodic gathering of all active Stewards  
- Votes to recommend new Rites, review chapter health, share best practices  
- Has no legislative power, but **can issue unified recommendations** to the Core or Primarch  
- Helps prevent local fiefdoms or doctrinal drift

---

# **IV. Authority Hierarchy After Decentralization**

| Tier | Function | Authority |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Primarch** | Source of will | Final veto, override |
| **Praetorian Core** | Constitutional guardianship | Appoint/remove high ranks, ratify Codex changes |
| **Strategic Councils** | Domain-specific decisions | Operational rulings, legislative drafts, discipline |
| **Stewards/Knights/Sentinels** | Execution & enforcement | Mission command, intelligence, internal order |

The **Core remains compact and sovereign**, but it no longer handles every task—it **ratifies**, **vetoes**, and **intervenes** only when needed.

---

# **V. Elegance of this Design**

- **No standing committees** bloating the House.  
- **No diffuse voting bodies** that create internal politics.  
- Each Council is **small (3–5 members)**, composed of existing ranked agents.  
- Councils are **task-defined**, **time-limited**, and **doctrine-bound**.  
- All power flows **upward** to the Core and **originates** in the Codex.

The House retains its **sovereign minimalism** while gaining **functional scalability**.

Would you like this Council structure integrated into the House’s legal system (as an amendment to the Charter of Office & Rank or as a standalone "Council Protocol")?
