Yes. You are correct to frame this as the **initial scoping pass**--the structural instantiation of a Campaign. It is not the full lifecycle model. It is the **entry procedure**, not the ongoing adaptive architecture.

* * *

## I. Clarification: What This Scoping Flow _Is_

It is the **initiation pass**--used to:

- Translate strategic intent into operational architecture
- Define Programs and Projects with enough resolution to unlock work
- Expose the first layer of Missions and identify where unknowns live

It is designed for:

- High ambiguity
- Strategic-to-operational translation
- Pre-execution clarity and delegation

> Think of it as a **doctrine-led surgical planning phase**, not a live command structure.

* * *

## II. What Happens After Execution Begins

Once execution starts, reality diverges. You are no longer in structural theory. You are in **adaptive field-level restructuring**.

What changes:

### 1. **Scoping becomes continuous.**

New Missions are spun up, split, killed.  
Programs may absorb or eject Projects.  
Field Officers surface frictions that reshape the tree.

> Initial scoping is frozen doctrine.  
Live scoping is kinetic doctrine under feedback.

### 2. **Bottom-up scoping becomes valid.**

During execution, **teams in the field may request structural changes**, e.g.:

- "This Project is too bloated--split into two"
- "This Mission keeps blocking three others--needs to become a Project"
- "This Program's KPI is diverging--realign under a new Campaign"

→ Such restructures are valid _only if surfaced through formal reporting lines_ (via FOs, not ad hoc).

### 3. **Strategic Ops (SO) switches role.**

From _planner_ → to _orchestrator and validator_.

They now:

- Approve new Mission charters
- Kill ineffective Projects
- Reassign capital between Programs
- Enforce structural minimalism and doctrinal compliance

## III. Flow Summary: Lifecycle of a Campaign

| Phase | Method | Authority Center | Scope Tool | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Initiation** | Top-down scoping (you have) | Strategic Council + SO | Strategic Mandate → Programs → Projects → Missions | 
| **Execution Phase 1** | Adaptive scoping | Commanders + FOs + SO | Missions spawned/split, Projects evolve | 
| **Execution Phase 2** | Strategic re-alignment | SO + Program Owners | Project exits, Program pivots | 
| **Closeout** | Consolidation + postmortem | SO + SC | Final structure archived, strategic lessons codified | 
* * *

## IV. Additional Modes Used During Execution

### 1. **Sprint Retrospectives**

Used within Missions to identify friction. Triggers Cell restructuring or minor Mission scoping changes.

### 2. **Mid-campaign Reviews**

Executed by Strategic Ops to assess:

- Project KPI divergence
- Program focus drift
- Budget-to-outcome ratios

Can lead to:

- Program termination
- Project reassignment
- Capital reallocation

### 3. **Shadow Mapping**

Maintained in doctrine: map actual evolved structure against initial scope to:

- Measure scope inflation
- Detect misaligned authority boundaries
- Inform future scoping accuracy

## V. Final Principle

> **Initial scoping is the instantiation of structure under doctrine.**  
**Ongoing execution is the dynamic reconciliation of structure against reality.**

You were correct to call out the lifecycle.  
Structure is not static. It is deployed, contested, evolved, and archived.  
That's how it endures.
