**Start here. Short, sharp, and high-impact:**

1. **Consulting Problem-Solving & Communication**  
   - **The Minto Pyramid Principle** (Barbara Minto) – or, if you're short on time, read a concise summary:  
     - Teaches you how to structure ideas and present them in a logical flow. Crucial for building clear, compelling slide decks and ensuring your arguments stand on solid ground.  
   - **“Firm Learning” on YouTube** – watch a handful of 10–15 min videos:  
     - Great for quick insights on standard consulting approaches (e.g. problem structuring, storyline-building, typical project workflows).

2. **PowerPoint & Excel Foundations**  
   - **Management Consulted** (YouTube or website) – even the free tutorials give you the basics of slide logic, consultant-level visuals, and fast Excel tips for quick data analysis.  
   - **LinkedIn Learning** (if available) – search for *“Excel for Business Analysts”* and *“PowerPoint Storytelling”*. Just pick short modules that show you the key functionalities and best practices.

3. **Lean Startup & Rapid Experimentation**  
   - **The Lean Startup** (Eric Ries) – if you’ve read it, skim a detailed summary or use Blinkist/getAbstract for a refresher. Focus on:  
     - *Build-Measure-Learn* cycle  
     - *Validated learning* and quick iteration  
   - **Steve Blank’s Customer Development Model** – short blog posts or mini YouTube videos that highlight how to test assumptions early and gather real feedback.

**If you go through these three clusters in that order, you’ll:**

1. **Structure & communicate** your ideas well (thanks to Minto + short consulting tutorials).  
2. **Deliver** quickly in PPT/Excel (with a near-consultant-level standard).  
3. **Embed** the *“build-measure-learn”* mindset in everything you do (Lean Startup approach).  

That’s your highest-leverage move – you can tackle the deeper or more niche resources once you have this core locked in.
