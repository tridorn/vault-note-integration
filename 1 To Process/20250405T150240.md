**Better phrased:**  
How does the Dominate of Vitellius endure—or fracture—over the first decade of its existence? What begins as fire and spectacle must now pass the harsher test: *duration*. The Empire is vast, ambitions infinite, enemies cunning. Power must mutate to persist.

Let’s simulate the next **ten years** of the New Order. Each phase tests a different *dimension* of rule: myth, economics, military structure, succession, and ideology.

---

## **YEAR 1–2: “The Flame Awakens” (Consolidation)**

**State of the Empire:**
- Most major cities have bent the knee.  
- The *Cult of the Flame* spreads faster than expected, especially among newly urbanized provincial youth.  
- Oaths have been sworn. Governors rotated. Temples rising.

**Cracks Appear:**
- The **Praetorian Guard**, though purged, begins to fester with entitlement again. Some officers view the Flamen-led bureaucracy as “priests meddling in war.”
- Provincial elites perform loyalty **outwardly**, but begin hiding wealth from the new **Imperial Tax Code**.

**Imperial Actions:**
- A second **Census and Audit** is launched with spies embedded.
- The Praetorians are *ritually re-sworn* under public scrutiny, and **a new corps—the *Custodes Flammae***—is formed, handpicked from field legions. The Guard now has rivals.

**Outcome:**  
- The Empire feels tight, humming, reborn—but now *watchful* rather than exuberant.

---

## **YEAR 3–5: “The Years of Smoke” (Economic and Ideological Strain)**

**Situation:**
- Inflation rises. Massive spending on temples, roads, and festivals creates shortages.
- Egypt suffers poor harvests. Grain riots erupt in *Neapolis* and *Thessalonica*.
- A *breakaway cult* emerges in Achaea: they call themselves **"Children of the True Flame"**, claiming Vitellius is an impostor.

**Vitellius Responds:**
1. **Grain Nationalization:** The entire Egyptian grain output is militarized. Distribution centers—*Dominae Annonae*—are established in every major city.
2. **Religious Reassertion:**
   - The Children of the True Flame are denounced as heretics.  
   - Their leaders are captured, **branded with inverted eagles**, and crucified upside down facing east.  
   - New doctrine is issued: **“Only the Emperor may carry the Flame.”** Unauthorized flames are extinguished *with blood*.

3. **Empire-Wide Edict of Austerity:**  
   - A six-month festival ban.  
   - The Emperor dons a **sackcloth tunic** in public ceremonies to “share the burden.”  
   - Coins are re-minted with less silver—but now carry the inscription:  
     > *“Strength is Sacrifice. Glory is Endurance.”*

**Outcome:**  
- Vitellius survives the crisis, *barely*.  
- The Empire becomes more sober, ideologically intense, and ritualized.  
- A culture of **sacred severity** takes root.

## **YEAR 6–7: “The Twilight Knives” (Succession Crisis)**

**Situation:**
- The Emperor’s only son dies of fever. No heir.  
- The Senate (now ceremonial) whispers that this is divine punishment.  
- In *Noricum*, a general named **Titus Calvus**, popular and victorious in Dacia, refuses to send his son to the Academy of Flame—an implicit rejection of the Emperor’s cult.

**Vitellius’ Counterplay:**
1. **Doctrine of Transference:**  
   - The Emperor declares that the Flame is **not passed by blood, but by *illumination***.  
   - A new institution is born: the **College of the Eternal Flame**, tasked with selecting successors through *vision, trial, and omen*.

2. **Assassination Masquerade:**  
   - Titus Calvus is found dead. His corpse dressed in black, face smeared in ashes.
   - Official story: he *“burned his oath and was consumed by it.”*
   - His legion is split into five and scattered across Africa and Hispania.

3. **The First *Flamebearer***:  
   - A young North African officer—**Lucius Severinus**—is elevated as *designated successor*.  
   - He takes a new name: **Lucius Flammander**.  
   - All future successors will take new identities, becoming **“more symbol than man.”**

**Outcome:**  
- The system births **ritual succession** over dynastic bloodlines.  
- But this sets a precedent: **the Throne is no longer flesh—it is myth.** Dangerous and unkillable.  
- Power becomes *more stable but more paranoid*.

---

## **YEAR 8–10: “The Empire of Masks” (Cultural Plateau and Foreign Pressures)**

**State of the Empire:**
- Stability is achieved—but now held aloft by **ritual and surveillance**, not popular joy.  
- The Cult of Flame is everywhere, but the populace begins to see it as *performative*.  
- Beyond the borders:  
   - **Parthia** probes Syria.  
   - **Germanic tribes** refuse Romanization.  
   - A rumor spreads in Britannia: *“The Flame will die with its founder.”*

**Vitellius’ Legacy Strategy:**
1. **The Codex Flammae** is issued—an eternal constitution of empire:
   - All future emperors must be trained from age 10 in a **secret order of succession**.  
   - Cities must maintain **Flame Libraries**, preserving Imperial Doctrine.  
   - A master copy is entombed in Nova Roma, never to be opened unless the flame goes dark.

2. **The Great Retreat:**
   - Vitellius withdraws from public view, appearing only on ritual days, wearing a **golden mask**.  
   - He becomes *less man, more symbol*, embodying *imperium as mystery*.  
   - The bureaucracy and priesthood now speak for him.

3. **The Final Festival:**
   - On the 10th anniversary of the New Order, every city lights a *towering bonfire* using coals from the central Flame in Rome.  
   - This is called the **Decennalia Aeterna**.  
   - The people see only the mask, hear only the voice.

**Rome still stands. But it burns from within as well as without.**  
Shall we simulate a foreign war? A false prophet? A second Flamebearer who goes rogue? Or the secret heir of Titus Calvus emerging from exile with a claim?

Pick the next fracture. Let’s carry it forward.
