**VERIDIAN — BANK BRIEFING DOSSIER**  
*(Confidential · May 2025 · 3-page digest)*  

---

### 1 | Executive Summary   

> **Mission** – Veridian eliminates the procedural friction that keeps small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from executing green-capex projects and keeps banks from profitably booking them.  
> **What we do** – A single front-end + data-engine that (i) scopes a project, (ii) matches a vetted vendor, (iii) auto-generates an EU-taxonomy-aligned loan dossier, and (iv) feeds it to a lender in a structured format.  
> **Why now** – EU banks self-report that only **≈4.5 %** of total lending carries a “green” label; the share for SMEs is closer to **2 %** (EBA, 2023). Yet every supervisory roadmap (EBA, ECB, SRB) → higher green-portfolio targets and stricter disclosure. The fastest path is digital origination at SME scale.

### 2 | Market Pain Points (Bank View)  

| Pain                                                                                           | Quantified Impact¹ | How Veridian Removes It                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Manual eligibility checks** (energy audits, EPC, DNSH)*                                       | 4-8 h / loan       | Pre-built rules + automatic EPC scrape; verifiable checklist   |
| **Fragmented vendor quotes** (3–5 back-and-forth e-mails)                                       | ≥ 10 days turn-time| Single quote-upload API; vendor KYC pre-done                   |
| **Small green tickets unprofitable** (≤ €100 k)                                                 | €400–€600 internal processing cost / file | Data arrives 100 % complete → processing cost falls by ≥ 40 % |
| **EU-taxonomy uncertainty** (EBA draft “green-loan label”)                                      | Compliance risk    | Dashboard maps every field to Taxonomy & LMA Green-Loan §§     |

<sub>¹ Numbers from interviews with five CEE banks + ProCredit baseline.</sub>

### 3 | Solution in One Graphic  

```
SME  ➜  Veridian Wizard  ➜  Vendor Quote  ➜  Auto-Packet (PDF+JSON)  ➜  Bank API / Inbox
```

*Wizard* = 20 mandatory fields (location, roof m², kWh, turnover, etc.)  
*Packet* = Credit template + ROI model + EPC proof + vendor KYC + DNSH matrix  
*Integration* = SFTP / REST JSON; no core-banking changes for pilot phase

### 4 | Pilot Blueprint (Illustrative)  

| Parameter                         | Value                                         |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Product type**                  | Rooftop solar ≤ €100 k                        |
| **Region**                        | Bucharest & Ilfov county                      |
| **Volume target**                 | 25 SMEs ≈ €1 m financed in 12 weeks           |
| **Success metrics**               | -40 % underwriting time · ≥ 90 % packet completeness · tCO₂ avoided |
| **IT effort for bank**            | 1 × SFTP folder OR 1 × REST endpoint (optional) |
| **Legal form**                    | 6-page MoU; liability capped for PoC          |

### 5 | Why It Pays (ProCredit-Style Example)  

| Metric                           | Without Veridian | With Veridian | Delta |
|----------------------------------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| Avg. preparation time / file     | 7.5 h            | 4.0 h         | **-46 %** |
| Approvals / FTE / month          | 17               | 32            | **+88 %** |
| Green-portfolio growth (12 mo)   | €8.5 m           | €15.5 m       | **+82 %** |
| Aggregate tCO₂ avoided           | 1 600 t          | 2 900 t       | **+81 %** |

Assumptions: €40 k avg loan; 3 underwriters; 8 % risk-weighted margin on new volume ⇒ additional €560 k net interest income p.a., pilot scale only.

### 6 | Compliance & Security Snapshot  

| Domain              | Status                                        |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **EU Taxonomy**     | Embedded technical criteria (Annex I & II)    |
| **EBA Green-Loan**  | Checklist mapped to draft label v. Nov 2023   |
| **GDPR**            | Data at rest in AWS eu-central-1 (Frankfurt); DPA ready |
| **ISO 27001**       | In progress (target Q4 2025)                  |
| **Pen-test**        | External CREST provider scheduled July 2025   |

### 7 | Business & Revenue Model (Transparent)  

| Stakeholder | Pays | Structure | Rationale |
|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Vendor**  | 1–2 % success fee | Deducted at disbursement | Lower CAC, faster close |
| **Bank**    | SaaS licence (after pilot) €25–50 k / yr | Unlimited users; API access | Underwriting cost savings outweigh fee |
| **SME**     | €0 mandatory | Optional IoT monitoring upsell | Keeps barrier to entry low |

Long-term upside → embedded lending revenue-share + green-ABS structuring fees.

3. **Option value**: MoU grants ProCredit right-of-first-refusal to scale to other CEE subsidiaries.  
4. **Zero-risk PoC**: No integration fees; liability capped; kill-switch if KPIs unmet.
