## **1. Mechanism to Provide Clear and Structured Advice**

To **decrease entry barriers** and provide users with clear, structured advice on what to do and where to start, you can implement a feature called the **"Guided Builder"**.

### **1.1. Guided Builder**

**Purpose**: The Guided Builder is an interactive tool that helps users define their goals and provides them with personalized action plans, leveraging the Maps and Modules system.

**How It Works**:

- **User Onboarding**: When a new user visits the site, they are prompted to use the Guided Builder to set up their profile and define their objectives.
- **Questionnaire**: The builder asks a series of questions to understand the user's current situation, goals, and interests.
- **Personalized Plan**: Based on the responses, the builder generates a customized roadmap, suggesting relevant Maps and Modules.
- **Action Steps**: The roadmap includes actionable steps, resources, and recommended services (e.g., consulting, workshops).

**Benefits**:

- **Clarity**: Users receive a clear starting point tailored to their needs.
- **Structure**: The roadmap provides a step-by-step guide.
- **Engagement**: Personalized content increases user engagement and satisfaction.
