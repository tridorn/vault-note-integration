Ads are intended to give you an emotional reaction because that will stick with you. Also see some ads/sponsered youtubers where they intentially do poorly because it triggers your urge to do it correctly.

There is a population of people who will see this having not played the game, think "Wow he can go in 1v6 and get two kills and he sucks. Also how does he not just avoid those bright yellow traps on the floor? I should get this game because I could do way better" and if they download the game the ad has done its job.

Theres a bunch of these now becsuse most people wised up to the "why does every ad have hot half naked people in it?" but not yet figured out the "Why does every ad make me cringe so hard that I can't get it out of my head for a week?"
