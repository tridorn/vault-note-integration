Love it—let’s strip it back to simple, hard, and effective. Here’s a 7-day plan built around Hannibal’s “Around the World” (ATW) circuit. Minimal variety, high demand.

Quick ATW refresher (the core of this week):
	•	1 round = 5 pull-ups + 5 dips + 10 push-ups
	•	Move steady, don’t hit failure. Keep 1–2 reps in reserve.
	•	Track completed rounds.

Weekly layout (repeatable)

Warm-up for every session (5–8 min): joint circles, band/arm swings, 10 scap pull-ups or dead hangs, 10 push-ups, 10 air squats, then 1 easy ATW round at half reps.

⸻

Day 1 – ATW Baseline (30–35 min cap)
	•	Main: AMRAP ATW for 30–35 min.
	•	Finisher: 3×30–45s hollow hold, 60s rest.
	•	Goal: set your round baseline.

Day 2 – Legs + Core (volume, simple)
	•	4 rounds (rest 60–90s):
	•	40 air squats
	•	20 reverse lunges (10/leg)
	•	30 calf raises
	•	60s plank
	•	Optional: 10–15 min easy walk afterward.

Day 3 – ATW Density (35–40 min cap)
	•	Main: AMRAP ATW for 35–40 min. Try to beat Day 1 by +1 round or same rounds in less time.
	•	Finisher: 3×10–15 slow leg raises or knee raises.

Day 4 – Active Recovery (keep it simple)
	•	30–45 min brisk walk or easy cycle.
	•	Mobility (10–15 min): hips, thoracic, shoulders.
	•	Grease-the-groove (optional): 3×5 very easy pull-ups and 3×10 easy push-ups spaced out—never near failure.

Day 5 – Legs + Core (harder)
	•	5 rounds (rest 60–90s):
	•	25 jump squats (swap to 35 air squats if joints complain)
	•	20 walking lunges (10/leg)
	•	20 hip thrusts or glute bridges
	•	45–60s side plank each side

Day 6 – ATW Push (40–45 min cap)
	•	Main: AMRAP ATW for 40–45 min. Pace steady; keep form pristine.
	•	Finisher: 2–3 sets: 30–45s dead hang + 10 scap pull-ups.

Day 7 – ATW Short Test or Full Rest (choose based on how you feel)
	•	Option A (short test): 20 min AMRAP ATW, go slightly faster than usual.
	•	Option B (rest): walk + mobility 20 min.
	•	Either way: review your log and note total ATW rounds this week.

⸻

Simple progression (run this for 3–6 weeks)
	•	Week to week: add +5 min to one ATW day or keep time the same and aim for +1 total round across the session.
	•	If every round felt easy: bump to 6 pull-ups / 6 dips / 12 push-ups next week.
	•	If elbows/shoulders bark: keep reps the same, slow the tempo, and cap sessions at 30–35 min.

Substitutions (keep it minimal)
	•	No dip bars? Straight-bar dips or bench dips (strict, shoulders down).
	•	Pull-ups too hard? Use bands or do controlled inverted rows (keep the 5-rep target).
	•	Push-ups too easy? Feet-elevated or diamond push-ups (still 10 reps).

Pacing & safety
	•	Breathe through your nose when possible, shake out arms between moves, avoid failure.
	•	Elbow/shoulder health: thumbs-over grip is fine, but keep scapula engaged; if pain persists, swap a day for recovery.

If you want, I can drop these sessions into reminders for the next 7 days at times you prefer.
