Precisely—what you meant was:

> *So with Supabase, I can build the entire product using just TypeScript (plus some SQL for database stuff)? I don’t need to touch Python, PHP, Java, or any other backend language?*

The answer is:

### **Yes. Supabase is TypeScript-native.**
You can build **100% of your logic, UI, and API calls in TypeScript**, plus a bit of SQL for defining your database schema.

---

### **What you’ll write, exactly:**

| Area | Language | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Frontend** (UI, pages, components) | TypeScript | In Next.js, Astro, or React |
| **Auth/API calls** (talking to Supabase) | TypeScript | Via `@supabase/supabase-js` client |
| **Database schema** (tables, columns) | SQL | Use SQL or Supabase's visual dashboard |
| **Row-level permissions** | SQL (with Supabase's policy system) | Declarative policies using SQL |
| **Edge Functions** (optional backend logic) | TypeScript | Just like writing a Next.js API route |

---

### **Even Supabase Functions Run in TypeScript**
You can write **server-side logic** (e.g., payment handling, webhooks, validation) as Edge Functions:

```ts
// supabase/functions/my-func/index.ts
export const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {
  return new Response('Hello from Supabase!', { status: 200 });
}
```

No need to learn a different runtime or language—**you stay in TypeScript all the way down.**

---

### **So what's the SQL for?**
Just one thing: **defining your database**.

Example:

```sql
create table profiles (
  id uuid primary key,
  username text unique,
  avatar_url text
);
```

You can write that in SQL, or just use Supabase’s UI (point-and-click) if you prefer.

---

### **So yes:**
- **One frontend language: TypeScript**
- **One backend interface: SQL (optional UI)**
- **One mindset:** no context-switching

You get the power of a real database *without* needing to hire backend engineers or mess with legacy stacks.

If you want, I can give you a mini boilerplate showing how to wire this all together: frontend, auth, DB, and logic—in one clean Typescript flow.
