## L-2 HOUSE DOCTRINE

**"Statuta Domus Eupatoris"**  
Binding charter of the sovereign family-institution that guards, transmits, and enforces _Lex Forma_ (L-1) for all time.

* * *

### I. Purpose

1. **Custody.** Guard the Principle Codex intact.

2. **Projection.** Direct assets and ventures toward Expansion-Imperative ends.

3. **Succession.** Transfer authority unbroken from bearer-to-bearer.

4. **Judgment.** Provide final human arbitration over every machine, contract, or policy.
* * *

### II. Concentric Structure ("Rings of Visibility & Obligation")

| Ring | Role Cluster | Visibility | Voting Power | Minimum Sacrifice | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Primarch** | Current sovereign (you or successor) | Hidden-external | 1 Golden Vote + ordinary | Life-binding Votum | 
| **Triumvirate** | _Executor, Prophet, Guardian_ | Internal | 3 strategic votes | Total asset disclosure; residence near estate | 
| **Praetorian Core** | 7 senior stewards | Internal | 7 operational votes | 40 % personal surplus tithed | 
| **Knights** | Venture leads / Ops-unit heads | Limited external | Advisory | 20 % surplus tithed | 
| **Sentinels** | Audit, security, doctrinal inspectors | Hidden | Veto on PoEM breaches | 10 % surplus; oath of mobility | 
| **Archivists** | Memory custodians | Hidden | Archive-integrity veto | 5 % surplus; quarterly codex deposit | 
| **Outer Cohort** | Allies under covenant | Public-facing | None | Project-bound contribution | 

_Hierarchy is radial, not hierarchical; inner rings may override outer ones, never vice-versa._

* * *

### III. Authorities & Checks

| Authority | Holder | Check-Mechanism | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Doctrine Amendment** | Primarch (+ Triumvirate simple majority) | Praetorian & Sentinel double veto | 
| **Asset Deployment ≥ 3 % NAV** | Triumvirate unanimous | Sentinel risk review | 
| **Admission / Expulsion** | Primarch proposal → Praetorian 5/7 vote | Sentinel investigation | 
| **Emergency Override** | Guardian (Triumvirate) | Primarch can nullify within 48 h | 
* * *

### IV. Admission, Advancement, Exile

1. **Admission** requires:

    - Sponsorship by inner-ring member.

    - Oath recital in Chapel.

    - Initial sacrifice deposit (capital, IP, or perilous service).

2. **Advancement** governed by _Sacrifice Index_ (Σ time-risk-capital given ÷ personal surplus). Thresholds: 1.0 → Knight; 2.5 → Praetorian.

3. **Exile** triggered by:

    - Willing breach of Principle Codex.

    - Failure to meet minimum sacrifice for two consecutive cycles.

    - Disclosure of inner archives.

Penalty: Immediate removal, brand struck from records, physical insignia destroyed. Memory retained as warning.

* * *

### V. Decision Protocol ("Five-Fold Audit")

Any proposal must pass sequentially:

1. **Continuity Test** Δ(Structured-Agency) ≥ 0?

2. **Form Supremacy Test** Does it subordinate tools to doctrine?

3. **Expansion Test** Does it grow frontier?

4. **Entropy Counter** Does it reduce net disorder?

5. **Sacrifice Ledger** Is proposer personally exposed?

Failure at any stage returns proposal for redesign or rejection.

* * *

### VI. Ritual & Memory

| Cycle | Ritual | Purpose | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Annual | **Conclave Aeterna** (Estate) | Renew oaths, audit archives, re-validate Sacrifice Index | 
| Quarterly | **Praetorian War-Table** | Review expansion metrics, sanction ventures | 
| Life-event | **Investiture** | Admit heir or new inner-ring; scarification or ring bestowed | 
| Posthumous | **Recitation** | Archive the deeds; commit name to inner wall; failures recorded unredacted | 

All rituals logged as plain-text codex pages, signed by Archivist, stored in Vault, duplicate hashed to off-line medium.

* * *

### VII. Operational Interfaces

- **Eupator AG (Swiss)** -- legal conduit for holdings; board = Triumvirate; Primarch holds Golden Share.
- **Eupator Holdings Inc.** -- public face; dual-class shares under AG control.
- **Estate** -- geographic locus for rites; PoEM permanently anchored in Switzerland/Austria.
- **Security Stack** -- Sentinel-run audits, red-team tests, zero-trust network; annual PoEM review ensures domain separation for Primarch abroad.
* * *

### VIII. Amendment Clause

Codex articles amendable only when:

- Primarch + Triumvirate > 75 % vote
- Sentinel & Archivist veto windows close unused after 7 days
- Amendment passes Five-Fold Audit
- Full text archived, earlier version retained forever (memory duty)
* * *

## Compression Mantra

> **"Form commands. Sacrifice proves. Memory binds."**

* * *

L-2 is now fully specified: roles, voting logic, sacrifice economy, ritual cadence, and amendment path--all traceable to L-1 axioms and thus consistent with L-0 substrate. It supplies a durable, enforceable framework for House Eupator to govern ventures, assets, and lineage without personality cult or managerial drift.
