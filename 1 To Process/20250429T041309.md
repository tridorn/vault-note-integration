Good — we'll start with the **font system**, because in Art Nouveau design, typography *is half the brand*.  
Here’s what you need for **Cvorum**:

---

# **Cvorum Art Nouveau Font Pairing (Master Set)**

## 1. **Headline / Display Font** (for titles, logos, large text)

### **Cormorant Garamond SemiBold**  
- Designer: Christian Thalmann (Google Fonts)  
- Style: Classic Garamond structure with extra elegance, finer contrast strokes — nods to Art Nouveau ornamentalism without kitsch.  
- Feel: Refined, slightly lyrical, evokes traditional craftsmanship.  
- Free: Available via Google Fonts (open source, free for commercial use).  

**Usage:**  
- Landing page hero headline.  
- Section headers (“How Cvorum Works”, “Why Trust Matters”).  
- Pull quotes and testimonials.

**Visual Example:**  
> **Cvorum: Where Proof Meets Purpose**

*(Large size, semi-condensed tracking, muted green or bronze color.)*

---

## 2. **Body / Paragraph Font** (for longer text, small screens)

### **Spectral Regular**  
- Designer: Production Type (Google Fonts)  
- Style: Humanist serif, designed for screen-readability, subtle classic vibe.  
- Feel: Professional, easy to read, elegant but not stiff.  
- Free: Google Fonts (open source).

**Usage:**  
- Body copy (about page, product descriptions).  
- Terms and conditions, privacy policy, blog posts.  
- Captions and secondary buttons.

**Visual Example:**  
> *At Cvorum, we believe evidence should be as enduring as the structures it supports. Our platform transforms sustainability from ambition into verified reality.*

# **Why This Pairing Works**

| Trait | Headline Font (Cormorant Garamond) | Body Font (Spectral) |
|-------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Elegance** | Yes, via ornamental glyphs | Subtle, understated |
| **Legibility** | Strong at large sizes | Strong at small sizes |
| **Art Nouveau Spirit** | Soft curves, organic ligatures | Humanist, non-mechanical forms |
| **Consistency** | Both serif, complementary stroke weights | Smooth visual transition |

---

# **Bonus Font for Accents or Logos (Optional Third Layer)**

### **Metropolis Regular** (or a custom Art Nouveau display font)
- Use sparingly for initials, single-character flourishes (like \"C.\" in Cvorum monograms).  
- Purpose: Inject even more flowing organic feeling when desired.

(You could later commission a custom \"C\" glyph to embed into your logo shield, as the centerpiece.)

# **Summary Cheat-Sheet**

| Element | Font | Size | Color | Notes |
|---------|------|------|-------|-------|
| H1 Main Headline | Cormorant Garamond SemiBold | 48–60 px | Deep green | High letter-spacing (looser kerning) |
| H2 Section Headers | Cormorant Garamond Regular | 32–36 px | Deep green | Slight italics allowed |
| Body Paragraphs | Spectral Regular | 18–20 px | Neutral dark grey | Comfortable line-height (1.4–1.6) |
| Captions/Legal | Spectral Light | 14–16 px | Grey | Small-caps allowed |

# **Next Micro-Step You Should Take Now**

- [ ] Install **Cormorant Garamond** and **Spectral** locally via Google Fonts.  
- [ ] Set up a super-basic Figma board or Canva project with these fonts applied to 3-4 typical sections (hero, about, process step, quote).  
- [ ] Start building the visual \"voice\" of Cvorum immediately — no design project survives if fonts change midstream.

Would you like me next to propose a **landing page wireframe**, fully aligned to this Art Nouveau brand + font structure?  
(I can lay it out in text first — a clean, practical blueprint you or a designer can execute.)
