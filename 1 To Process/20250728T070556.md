You meant: "Define a practical, environment-specific workflow and tool deployment plan for my current analog setup (notebook-centric, mobile), specifying which instrument to use for what and when."

* * *

## 0. Operating Principles

1. Capture fast, refine later.

2. One primary carry set, one home base set.

3. Draft in erasable media, commit in permanent ink only after structure exists.

4. Color and symbols signal logic, not decoration.

5. Review cycles are scheduled, not ad hoc.

## 1. Core Environments → Load-out

### A. Mobile (library, café, benches, courses)

Carry only what fits in the notebook slip plus a slim pouch.

- Instant jot and cheap-paper duty: **Lamy 2000 4-in-1 (black ink default, red/blue for quick tagging, pencil for margin scaffolds)** or **Jetstream 0.5** if you skipped the Lamy.
- Structured drafting before ink: **Rotring 600 pencil** with HB lead (or H if you ink over it later).
- Final committed lines or headings that deserve character: **Pilot Falcon** (inked with Iroshizuku for easier maintenance on the move).
- Micro-annotation and diagrams: **Micron 01 and 03** only. Leave the full size range at home.
- Highlighting/grouping: **One Mildliner** (pick a neutral tone).
- Correction: **Mono Zero** eraser.  
Everything else stays in the home kit.

### B. Home desk (your table, parents' house)

This is the processing and archival station.

- Full Micron set (005 to 08).
- Tombow Fudenosuke, Pentel Pocket Brush (Phase 2+3 items).
- Mildliner set.
- Technical aids: ruler, templates.
- Maintenance: syringe, pen flush, microfiber cloth.
- Spare inks, refills, lead grades.

### C. Project-specific large sheets or Post-its

- Draft with Rotring pencil (H for clean erasure).
- Ink with Micron 03/05 for structure, Falcon for headings.
- Color code with Mildliners or the red/blue in the Lamy 2000 if portability matters.

## 2. Workflow Loop

### Step 1. Raw capture (real time)

Tool: Lamy 2000 black or Jetstream.  
Medium: bound notebook, margin codes (e.g. "T:" for task, "Q:" for question).  
Rule: never hesitate on the pen choice; speed beats aesthetics here.

### Step 2. Same-session micro-structure

Tool: Rotring pencil for quick boxes/arrows if spatial arrangement matters. Otherwise skip.  
If the idea stabilises, switch to Micron 01 to lock edges or tiny diagrams.

### Step 3. Commit and emphasise

Tool: Pilot Falcon for headings, key statements, formulas worth remembering.  
Keep it brief; Falcon is for signal lines, not every sentence.

### Step 4. Visual hierarchy

Tool: Mildliner bullet tip to tag categories, priorities, or course codes.  
Avoid multiple colors on the fly; pick one per day or per project to reduce cognitive overhead.

### Step 5. End-of-day triage (10 minutes)

At home or before sleep:

- Scan pages for open loops.
- Move actionable items to your task system (digital or analog).
- Mark migrated items with the Lamy red refill or a Mildliner stripe.
- Pencil any missing links you will ink next day.

### Step 6. Weekly consolidation (one block, e.g. Sunday evening)

- Transfer settled concepts to larger sheets or structured course notes.
- Now deploy full Micron range, ruler, templates, brush pens.
- Use Platinum Carbon Black in the Falcon only if the page is final and you will overlay washes or color.

## 3. Instrument Decision Map (fast heuristic)

| Situation | Paper quality | Action | Instrument | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Immediate idea on toilet paper-tier stock | Poor | Capture only | Lamy 2000 black or Jetstream | 
| Margin symbol, checkbox, micro diagram | Good or average | Permanent precision | Micron 01 (or 005 if tiny) | 
| Drafting a layout or schema | Any | Erasable structure | Rotring pencil (H/HB) | 
| Statement you want to re-read in 6 months | Good | Expressive commit | Falcon (dye ink), later Carbon Black | 
| Urgent tag or priority mark | Any | Color code | Lamy red/blue or Mildliner | 
| Final clean diagram lines, archival | Good | Consistent stroke | Micron 03/05 or Isograph if you own it |

## 4. Media Segmentation

- **Bound notebook**: Inbox. Everything enters here first.
- **Post-its**: Ephemeral reminders on book pages or monitor frames. Remove or archive weekly.
- **Large sheets**: Only for processed syntheses, course frameworks, or problem sets. Hang or file flat.
- **Digital**: Reference repository, scanned finals, deadlines. No raw thinking here.
* * *

## 5. Maintenance Cadence

- Falcon on dye ink: flush monthly. On Carbon Black: flush every 2 weeks.
- Microns: cap them instantly; store tip-down for 1 minute after long inactivity to refresh flow.
- Rotring pencil: blow out lead dust monthly. Replace lead grade by ejecting remnants first.
- Lamy 2000 multipen: check refills quarterly; pencil lead tube should always hold 3 sticks.
* * *

## 6. Redundancy and Fail-safes

- One spare black-writing instrument in your bag (Jetstream mini or cheap ballpoint).
- One micro-eraser in wallet or pouch.
- Photographic backup: shoot critical pages with phone during the weekly review.
* * *

## 7. Rules to Avoid Chaos

1. Never carry more than five writing instruments daily. Decision fatigue kills usage.

2. One color rule per context. Today's lecture = blue, thesis notes = green, etc.

3. Pencil first if you need spatial accuracy. Ink first if you only need words.

4. If a page is important, date stamp it.

5. Refile or rewrite anything you mark twice; double-tagged notes indicate poor system placement.

* * *

Outcome: a lightweight daily capture stack, a controlled commit layer, and a home consolidation routine. The Falcon stays special; the Lamy 2000 and pencil handle brute work; Microns formalise; Mildliners signal. The rest is discipline.
