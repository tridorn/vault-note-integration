# Kindness and boundaries 

Your question could be phrased more precisely as: *"To what extent should a Stoic practice tolerance, kindness, and forgiveness towards others, and at what point does it become necessary to assert boundaries or take action?"*

Stoicism indeed teaches the importance of practicing virtues such as kindness, forgiveness, and compassion, while also emphasizing the critical value of wisdom and justice. The Stoic seeks to strike a balance: being forgiving and tolerant of others' imperfections, while not allowing oneself to be taken advantage of or complicit in harmful behavior. Here are some guiding principles based on Stoic philosophy to help clarify this balance:

### 1. **Kindness and Tolerance Rooted in Reason**
Stoicism teaches that all human beings are part of a larger cosmic order and that everyone is subject to ignorance and error. Marcus Aurelius constantly reminds himself that people act according to their nature, often out of ignorance or a lack of wisdom. A Stoic therefore practices compassion and patience, recognizing that most unkind or unjust actions stem from people’s flaws or misunderstanding rather than malice.

- **Example of Stoic Tolerance**: If someone behaves rudely or thoughtlessly toward you, the Stoic response would be to remind yourself that their behavior is likely driven by ignorance or an emotional imbalance. Instead of reacting with anger or hurt, you let it slide, recognizing that you cannot control their actions, only your response.

**Guiding principle**: Be tolerant and kind when you recognize that the other person is acting out of ignorance, and maintain your own calm composure in the face of their missteps. The aim is to foster your own peace of mind while extending compassion.

### 2. **Setting Boundaries for Justice**
While Stoicism teaches forgiveness, it does not advocate for passivity in the face of injustice or harm. Justice is one of the cardinal Stoic virtues, and it requires that we act to maintain fairness and protect the rights of others as well as ourselves. Letting everything "slide" could undermine justice and allow harmful behaviors to persist unchecked.

- **Example of Setting Boundaries**: If a colleague consistently takes credit for your work, the Stoic response would be to calmly, but firmly, address the issue. You might say, "I’d appreciate it if in future we could clarify whose contributions are being represented." This is not about reacting emotionally, but about protecting what is fair and right without seeking revenge or personal gain.

**Guiding principle**: You should assert boundaries when the actions of others violate justice—whether they affect you or others—while always ensuring that your response is measured, rational, and free from emotional excess. The key is to protect fairness without becoming emotionally entangled or retaliatory.

### 3. **Correcting Others for Their Own Benefit**
Stoicism also encourages the correction of others when their actions stem from ignorance, not out of superiority, but out of a desire to help them improve. Epictetus advises that when we correct others, it should be done calmly and with the intention of benefiting them, not for the sake of proving ourselves right or superior.

- **Example of Correction**: If a friend is making a poor decision or behaving in a self-destructive way, a Stoic might say, “I’ve noticed that this choice might not be in your best interest. Here’s what I think could help you make a better decision.” The goal is not to criticize but to offer wisdom and guidance, as long as the other person is receptive.

**Guiding principle**: Be kind and corrective when it can help others improve or avoid harm, but always in a calm and nonjudgmental manner. Your goal is not to impose control but to act in the interest of their well-being.

### 4. **Knowing When to Walk Away**
There are situations where kindness, tolerance, and correction will not be effective because the person involved is either unwilling to change or is persistently harmful. In such cases, Stoicism teaches us to remove ourselves from the situation. Marcus Aurelius speaks of avoiding entanglements with those who persist in ignorance or malice, not out of anger, but out of a sense of self-preservation.

- **Example of Walking Away**: If someone repeatedly acts in ways that undermine your well-being or the well-being of others, and it is clear they are unwilling to change, the Stoic course of action may be to distance yourself from them. This could mean ending a toxic relationship or disengaging from a harmful environment.

**Guiding principle**: When continued kindness and tolerance become harmful to your peace of mind or virtue, it is time to calmly distance yourself. This does not mean you harbor resentment or anger; you simply recognize that removing yourself from the situation is the most virtuous choice for your well-being.

### 5. **Kindness Without Attachment**
In practicing kindness, Stoicism teaches that your actions should be based on your own virtue and not on expectations of reciprocity. You should be kind and forgiving because it aligns with your values, not because you expect others to respond in kind or because you fear confrontation. 

- **Example of Kindness Without Attachment**: You might offer help to a difficult colleague, knowing they are unlikely to reciprocate or even appreciate it. You do so not for their approval but because it is the virtuous thing to do. If they continue their behavior, you remain unaffected by their ingratitude, focusing on your own actions rather than their response.

**Guiding principle**: Be kind without expectation or attachment to the outcome. Act based on your own values, not in the hope of controlling how others behave in return.

### 6. **Reacting to Persistent Disrespect**
If someone continues to disrespect or mistreat you, a Stoic recognizes that while patience and tolerance are virtues, persistent mistreatment may require a firm response, not out of pride, but for the sake of justice and self-respect.

- **Example of Addressing Persistent Disrespect**: Suppose a friend continually disrespects your time, always being late or disregarding your plans. The Stoic approach would be to calmly express your feelings, “I’ve noticed you often don’t show up on time. It’s important to me that we respect each other’s schedules.” If the behavior continues, you might limit your interactions with them, prioritizing relationships that reflect mutual respect.

**Guiding principle**: Address persistent disrespect rationally and without anger, but assertively. If the behavior continues, set boundaries or distance yourself, as repeated disrespect can disrupt your own pursuit of virtue.

### Conclusion
In Stoicism, kindness, tolerance, and forgiveness should be extended as expressions of your own virtue. However, this doesn’t mean allowing yourself to be mistreated or complicit in others' harmful behaviors. A Stoic remains kind and patient when dealing with ignorance but also sets firm boundaries to protect justice and self-respect. The balance lies in acting with reason and wisdom: you let minor offenses slide, correct others when necessary, and walk away when continued engagement would undermine your inner tranquility or sense of justice.
