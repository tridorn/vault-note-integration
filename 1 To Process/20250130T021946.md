# Quotes in Note-Taking System

## Exposition

#a/fM 

When you extract verbatim content from another source, you need to set it apart to make it distinct from your original content. 

- **Inline Quotes**: If the quote is short, integrate it into your text using quotation marks.
	 - *e.g.* According to Smith, "AI will revolutionize industries."

- **Block Quotes**: For longer excerpts, use a distinct style to set it apart from the main body of the text. In markdown editors like Obsidian, you can use `>` to create a block quote.

	 ```
    > AI's potential in the next decade is immense. From healthcare to finance, every domain will witness a transformation. The key is to remain adaptable and forward-thinking.
    ```

	 - Always attribute block quotes to their source.
