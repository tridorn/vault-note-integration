I. Re-frame the problem  
You do not need generic "credibility". You need three discrete assets whose absence constrains any serious counterpart:  
1. A legal locus to sign contracts.  
2. An institutional guarantor to calm public-sector gatekeepers.  
3. A micro-track-record that signals repeatability.  
Everything below builds those assets in < 12 months.

II. Asset 1 -- legal locus (cost ≈ €1 300)  
• Register Eupator UG (haftungsbeschränkt). Minimum capital €1 000; notary and Handelsregister fees ≈ €300. The UG's existence lets you open a bank account, issue NDAs, and apply for municipal subsidies.  
• File the Satzung with a broad "Aufbau, Beteiligung und Verwaltung von innovativen Unternehmen" purpose. That phrasing covers studio operations, fund management, and service income; you will not need early amendments.

III. Asset 2 -- institutional guarantor (zero cash, high leverage)  
1. Secure a supervising professor. Approach Prof. Dr. Michael Woywode, Chair of SME Research & Entrepreneurship, whose institute already runs the MCEI platform and interfaces with EXIST administration ([BWL Mannheim](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/woywode/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
Offer: his chair becomes scientific partner of Eupator; he receives board observer status plus 0.5 % sweat equity in the UG.  
2. Sign a letter of cooperation with NEXT MANNHEIM. They operate eight specialised centres and a municipalities-backed Up2B accelerator, giving you instant access to space and mentor rosters ([NEXT MANNHEIM](https://next-mannheim.de/sections/startup-mannheim/)).  
3. Publish both agreements on day 1. Borrowed legitimacy is now visible to outside capital.

IV. Asset 3 -- micro-track-record (90 days)  
Stage-gate methodology:  
A. Recruit 10--12 Mannheim MBAs and 10--12 engineers from KIT and TU Darmstadt; run a 48-hour hackathon inside the Q-Hackathon slot (23--24 April 2025) and brand it "Eupator Deep-Tech Sprint" ([q-summit.com](https://www.q-summit.com/hackathon?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
B. Advance the three best teams into a six-week sprint, coached by Woywode's doctoral candidates via MCEI's Inside-the-Venture format.  
C. Culmination: each team pitches at Q-Summit (24--25 April 2025) where investors and media are already present ([q-summit.com](https://www.q-summit.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
Deliverable: one incorporated prototype, two further concepts, local press coverage, and first external angel commitments. That is enough "evidence" for bureaucracy and seed LPs.

V. Immediate financing stack  
• EXIST-Gründerstipendium: as a student founder you draw €1 000 / month for up to 12 months plus €10 000 in material budget; the application is filed by your university and signed by Prof. Woywode ([bmwk.de](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Publikationen/exist-business-start-up-grant.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
• City of Mannheim innovation vouchers: claim up to €20 000 in service credits via NEXT Mannheim once your UG is registered (no equity dilution).  
• Angel bridge: target €100 k convertible capped at €1 m post-money to finance the hackathon, legal work, and a part-time CTO-in-residence.

VI. Positioning for the 2025 "Startup Factory" project phase  
The concept-phase finalists were fixed in June 2024; entry is now only through private-partner seats within one of the ten forthcoming factories ([https://www.ptj.de/](https://www.ptj.de/foerdermoeglichkeiten/exist/startup-factories?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [https://www.ptj.de/](https://www.ptj.de/lw_resource/datapool/systemfiles/cbox/14730/live/lw_bekdoc/richtlinie-exist-startup_fabriken-281-29.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Offer Eupator as an execution subcontractor (founder matching, seed vehicle, governance tooling). Private co-funding is mandatory (≥ 50 %); your angel bridge plus any HTGF soft commitment qualifies.  
HTGF IV closed at €494 m, remains the default seed partner for deep-tech; cultivate a relationship early ([htgf.de](https://www.htgf.de/en/final-closing-htgf-iv/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

VII. Credibility flywheel (months 6-12)  
1. Issue a quarterly "Rhine-Neckar Deal Memo" newsletter summarising local rounds; circulate to HTGF, SAP.iO, BASF VC, and the Mannheim press.  
2. Host a monthly founders' lunch at MAFINEX; use NEXT Mannheim calendar to attract walk-ins (it already lists >30 events/month) ([NEXT MANNHEIM](https://next-mannheim.de/sections/startup-mannheim/)).  
3. Public signalling: LinkedIn posts showcasing each sprint KPI, podcast guest slots, and short op-eds on German deep-tech capital gaps. All content references Eupator UG, reinforcing legal and institutional anchors.

VIII. Personal economics  
• You hold ≥ 90 % of Eupator UG now; carve out 10 % for the professor and two domain-experts to avoid "single-founder" discount.  
• Charge sprint teams a €5 k programme fee, rolled into their first convertible to Eupator.  
• Upon external seed, lock in 15--20 % studio equity and a 2 % management fee on any opportunity fund you raise.

IX. Stop-conditions  
If after 12 months no external capital > €250 k is committed or no prototype attracts pre-seed interest, liquidate the UG and pivot to a pure student society; sunk cost is < €5 k. Conversely, if KPI targets are met, extend studio working capital to €1 m and formalise a €20--30 m seed follow-on fund.

Implement the sequence precisely; avoid diffuse networking, unpaid hackathons, or premature pitch-deck tours. Execution discipline and borrowed authority will convert a zero-status student into a visible regional deal-originator within one academic year.
