Clarification: The question would be better posed as: _"What is the minimal, coherent hardware baseline required to support IT infrastructure for a technically fluent SME, balancing resilience, autonomy, and operational leverage?"_

Here is the rationalised entry-level architecture for a small to medium enterprise (1--25 personnel, hybrid or on-site), assuming moderate technical competence (basic networking, light scripting, comfort with web UIs):

* * *

### **Core Functional Domains and Corresponding Hardware**

#### 1. **Network Foundation**

- **Router**: MikroTik hAP ax³ or Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE (depending on UI tolerance).

    - Trade-off: MikroTik offers full configurability, brutal learning curve. Ubiquiti has a polished GUI but less protocol depth.
- **Modem/Bridge**: Provider-specific (e.g., DrayTek Vigor 167 for DSL in Germany).
- **Switch**: Netgear GS308T or TP-Link TL-SG2210MP (if PoE is needed).
- **Wi-Fi Access Points**: Ubiquiti UniFi 6 Lite x1--2 depending on floor plan.

**Function**: Segmented LAN, VLANs for guests/IoT, DHCP/DNS control, captive portal, traffic shaping.

* * *

#### 2. **Storage and Internal Cloud**

- **NAS**: Synology DS923+ with 2x4TB IronWolf in RAID1.

    - Expandable. Supports Docker, VMs, Active Backup, and multi-user access.
- **Backup Target**: External USB HDD for offline backup, and optionally Synology C2 or Wasabi for offsite replication.

**Function**: Secure file server, internal Dropbox, device backup, limited self-hosting (e.g., Git, wiki, Vaultwarden).

* * *

#### 3. **Identity and Access Control**

- **Directory**: Synology Directory Server (on NAS) or external provider (e.g., JumpCloud) for LDAP/SAML.

    - Not mandatory at first, but needed to scale user management beyond 5--10 employees.
* * *

#### 4. **Security and Filtering**

- **Firewall**: Router OS-based or pfSense box (e.g., Protectli Vault with pfSense CE).

    - Only if advanced segmentation or firewall rules are needed.
- **DNS Filtering**: Pi-hole or AdGuard Home on a Raspberry Pi 4 or in NAS Docker.
- **VPN Gateway**: GL.iNet Beryl AX or WireGuard server hosted on NAS/router.

**Function**: Network-level ad blocking, secure remote access, DNS logging.

* * *

#### 5. **Device Management (Optional Tier-2 Layer)**

- **MDM**: Use open-source solutions (e.g., Mosyle for Apple, or basic scripts) or adopt low-scale JAMF Now/Intune as needed.
- **Patch management**: Optionally Ansible scripts or use Synology's update scheduler for NAS.
* * *

#### 6. **Peripherals**

- **Printer/Scanner**: Brother MFC-L3770CDW or similar. Well-behaved on networks and supports SMB/Scan-to-email.
- **UPS**: APC Back-UPS Pro (for NAS + router at minimum) to mitigate brownouts or unexpected power loss.
* * *

### **Minimalist Bill of Materials (Baseline Deployment)**

| Function | Model | Est. Cost (€) | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Router | MikroTik hAP ax³ | 130 | 
| Switch | TP-Link TL-SG2210MP | 90 | 
| AP x2 | UniFi 6 Lite | 2 × 110 | 
| NAS | Synology DS923+ | 530 | 
| HDDs | Seagate IronWolf 4TB x2 | 2 × 100 | 
| UPS | APC BX950U-GR | 120 | 
| External HDD | WD My Passport 5TB | 120 | 
| VPN/Travel Router | GL.iNet Beryl AX | 90 | 

**Total ≈ €1,500 (ex-VAT)**

* * *

### **Strategic Guidance**

- **Scale modularly**: Add a second NAS as hot standby later, or expand into Synology High Availability.
- **Avoid overengineering**: No self-hosted email, no full Kubernetes. Stick to Docker, Nginx reverse proxy, and SSO where needed.
- **Control upstream dependence**: Rely on upstream clouds (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft 365) only for identity and productivity, not file storage or core data.
* * *

**Summary Judgment**:

A technically literate SME can deploy a secure, performant, and sovereign IT foundation with under €2K in initial capital expenditure. Synology acts as the operational backbone. Ubiquiti or MikroTik secures and segments the network. Everything else is modular. This stack balances control and maintainability without burdening with sysadmin overhead.
