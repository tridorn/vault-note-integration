Your observation is astute. Using dual names (e.g., *"Planning and Scoping"*, *"Designing and Prototyping"*) reflects an attempt to clarify nuanced activities within each stage. However, it can create confusion about whether the terms are distinct or interchangeable. The **correct approach** is to use **one clear, precise name per stage**, with additional details provided in the explanation if necessary.

Hereâ€™s a revision for consistency and simplicity:

### **Revised Project Stages (Single Names)**

1. **Ideation**: Envisioning and defining the project's purpose and scope.
2. **Planning**: Structuring and prioritizing tasks with clear timelines and milestones.
3. **Designing**: Creating conceptual or physical models to validate feasibility.
4. **Execution**: Developing and implementing the solution in iterative cycles.
5. **Review**: Assessing progress and incorporating feedback for improvement.
6. **Delivery**: Finalizing the project and transitioning it to stakeholders or users.
7. **Maintenance**: Supporting and iterating on the deliverables post-deployment.
8. **Closure**: Concluding the project and extracting lessons learned.

### Why I Previously Used Two Names

1. **Clarification**: Stages often include multiple activities (e.g., "Planning and Scoping" highlights both planning tasks and the scoping of deliverables).
2. **Flexibility**: Broader phrasing accommodates varied project contexts (e.g., "Designing and Prototyping" covers both high-level and iterative design work).
3. **Dual Nature of Activities**: Some stages (e.g., Review) inherently involve dual aspects (e.g., assessing deliverables *and* adapting the plan).

### Correct Approach: Single Names With Explanation

Use **one concise name per stage**, reserving additional terms for sub-activities within the stage description. For example:

- **Planning**: Includes scoping, risk analysis, and roadmap creation.
- **Designing**: Encompasses both foundational blueprints and iterative prototyping.

This ensures simplicity while preserving clarity.
