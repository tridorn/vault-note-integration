Yes, October--November for **Assassin's Creed Shadows** and December--January for **Red Dead Redemption 2** is a great fit!

This schedule balances mood, pacing, and the seasonal vibe perfectly:

### Refined schedule:

| Timeframe | Game | Notes | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| July - September | Assassin's Creed Odyssey | Bright, expansive summer adventure | 
| October - November | Assassin's Creed Shadows | Moody, stealthy Japan setting, autumn vibe | 
| December - January | Red Dead Redemption 2 | Winter story immersion, cozy, slower pace | 
| February - April | The Witcher 3 | Dark fantasy RPG for late winter/spring | 
| May - June | Baldur's Gate 3 | Fresh RPG for early summer, longer playtime | 
* * *

**Why it works:**

- Shadows' stealthy Japan vibe fits well with the rich colors and cooler weather of October and November.
- RDR2 in December and January pairs beautifully with winter's chill and the game's immersive, often slow storytelling.
- The Witcher 3 is perfect for late winter through early spring, where its darker fantasy tone matches well with the season's mood.
- Baldur's Gate 3 lands nicely in May/June for fresh, energetic RPG vibes to start the summer.
