Below is a **high-level roadmap** for **building your company** around this fintech solution, **raising capital**, and evolving from an early pilot stage to a growth-stage venture.

---

## **1. Company Formation & Early Operations**

### **A. Choose the Right Legal Structure**
1. **Location & Registration** – Incorporate in a jurisdiction that supports startups (e.g., Delaware C-Corp if aiming for U.S. VC, or a local/EU entity if that’s more relevant).  
2. **Founding Team** – Ensure clarity on **equity splits** and roles (CEO, CTO, etc.). Draft a basic **Shareholders Agreement** early.

### **B. Build a Small, Focused Team**
1. **Core Founders** – Typically 2–3 founders handle product, tech, and business.  
2. **Key Early Hires** – For a fintech solution, you’ll likely need:  
   - A **Lead Engineer or Tech Cofounder** (if not in-house)  
   - A **Business Development / Partnerships** lead to manage bank relationships  
   - Possibly a **subject-matter expert** in ESG or green finance as an advisor  
3. **Bootstrapping & Outsourcing** – At the pre-seed stage, you can **outsource** certain tasks (UI design, dev sprints) to keep burn low, but try to keep **core IP** in-house.

---

## **2. Pilot Execution & Early Traction**

### **A. Finalize MVP/Pilot Product**
- **Minimal but functional**: A web-based aggregator + the wizard for collecting SME data, matching to vendors, and generating “application packets” for banks.

### **B. Secure “Design Partner” Bank (ProCredit)**
- Sign an **LoI (Letter of Intent)** or pilot agreement if possible, detailing:
  - **Scope**: ~3–6 month pilot, # of SME projects targeted  
  - **Data sharing** or feedback expectations  
  - **Success metrics** (approval time, # of loans financed)  
- No exclusivity if possible—**retain freedom** to replicate the pilot with other banks.

### **C. Gather Real-World Data**
- Track **time saved**, # of **successful loans** vs. normal baseline, SME & bank user feedback.  
- This data is gold for **fundraising**, future partner pitches, and refining your product roadmap.

---

## **3. Early Fundraising (Pre-Seed / Seed)**

### **A. When to Raise**
- Typically **after** you have:
  1. A working MVP  
  2. A **pilot** or at least a strong **LoI** from ProCredit  
  3. Some initial **SME user success** stories

### **B. Who to Target**
1. **Angel Investors** – Individuals passionate about climate/fintech, or with relevant BFSI experience.  
2. **Pre-Seed VC Funds** – Especially those focusing on **impact investing** (green/climate tech) or **fintech**.  
3. **Grants & Public Funding** – E.g., EU’s Horizon programs, EBRD “Star Venture” or local government grants for green innovation.  
4. **Strategic Investors** – Possibly a small investment from a bank or ESG fund, though be mindful of terms that might constrain future growth.

### **C. Crafting Your Pitch**
1. **Highlight Traction** – “We partnered with ProCredit, here’s pilot data proving ROI.”  
2. **Scalable Market** – Show how many banks/SMEs worldwide face the same green-lending friction.  
3. **Revenue Model** – Transaction fees, subscription fees, or a blend.  
4. **Team Credibility** – Founders’ backgrounds, relevant domain expertise, plus strong advisors.  

---

## **4. Company & Product Development**

### **A. Expand Product Features & Integrations**
1. **Add More Green Project Types** – e.g., insulation, HVAC, EV fleets—based on pilot learnings.  
2. **Possible Government/Donor Integration** – If you can incorporate local subsidies, automatic grants, or EBRD/EIB programs, you’ll gain an edge.  
3. **Vendor Directory** – Onboard more installers and suppliers to create a “one-stop” project scoping experience.

### **B. Build a Repeatable Sales Model**
- Document how you **pitch** to new banks:
  - A “Playbook” with the pilot results, use cases, typical implementation timeline  
  - A straightforward tech approach: either a white-labeled or co-branded version, or minimal integration.

### **C. Recruit for Scale**
- As you raise a seed round, hire more **engineers**, a **product manager** (to coordinate expansions), and a **customer success** or **implementation** lead who can handle new bank rollouts.

---

## **5. Scaling Beyond the First Bank**

### **A. Multi-Bank Rollouts**
- Use your **ProCredit pilot** as your success story to sign additional regional banks.  
- Focus on **regions** where decarbonization funds are abundant—Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe.  
- Partnerships with **IFIs (EBRD, IFC)** can also help introduce you to multiple banks in their networks.

### **B. Evolve to a Platform Play**
- Over time, your aggregator can:
  - Offer **carbon credit generation/verification** for larger projects  
  - Integrate with **IoT** or energy management tools to **automate post-loan performance tracking**  
  - Provide an **analytics dashboard** for banks to measure portfolio-wide carbon impact  
- Keep the **core** of your business: bridging banks, SMEs, and green vendors.

### **C. Series A Fundraising**
- Once you have multiple paying bank clients, consistent revenue, and proven ROI:
  - Raise **Series A** from climate-tech VCs or mainstream VCs that see your “regional aggregator” with potential to expand globally.  
  - This capital allows for **product scale**, more **enterprise-level** integrations, and expansions to new regions.

---

## **6. Long-Term Vision**

1. **Dominate a Region First**  
   - Aim to be the standard for **green SME financing** in Southeastern Europe/Eastern Europe.  
2. **Move to Adjacent Markets**  
   - Possibly Central Europe, the Balkans, or even Africa/Latin America if you see synergy (and if your product fits local frameworks).  
3. **Build “Green Infrastructure”**  
   - As you accumulate data on real energy savings, you can become a **de facto** rating or risk-scoring platform for green loans—like a specialized Plaid or Stripe for sustainable finance.

---

## **7. Key Pitfalls to Avoid**

1. **Overly Relying on a Single Bank**  
   - Great if ProCredit invests, but do not let them **bind you** to exclusivity or hamper your pivot to other banks.  
2. **Ignoring Regulatory Complexity**  
   - Green finance can be multi-layered (EU taxonomy, local subsidies, data protection). Stay informed or hire domain experts.  
3. **Underestimating Sales Cycle**  
   - Selling to banks can be **slow**. Factor 6–12 months for each major deal. Keep your **burn rate** low and parallelize multiple bank discussions.  
4. **Lack of Focus**  
   - Resist the urge to build 10 features at once. Start with 1–2 green solutions (e.g., solar, HVAC) and do them **extremely well**.

---

## **Putting It All Together**

1. **Formalize the Company** – Clear roles, minimal overhead, base legal docs.  
2. **Pilot & MVP** – Build a small, functional product. Test it with ProCredit or a comparable design partner.  
3. **Validate & Fundraise** – Show real data from the pilot to angels, seed VCs, or impact funds. Raise enough to scale your dev & sales teams.  
4. **Expand Regionally** – Onboard multiple banks, keep refining the product.  
5. **Series A** – With proven revenue from multiple clients, raise bigger capital to become the leading green-finance aggregator platform in your region, eventually going global.

**The key** is to remain nimble—always gather real usage data, maintain a tight feedback loop with early adopters, and ramp up only once you have tangible proof of product-market fit. This ensures your company is built on **solid fundamentals**, not overhype, and sets you on a path to **sustainable growth**.
