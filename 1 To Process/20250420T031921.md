Certainly. Below is a clarified, precision-mapped breakdown of each **flow**, restructured to be *crystal-clear, functional*, and *implementation-ready*. Think of each flow as a **discrete transaction corridor**—with actors, data, triggers, and failure points.

---

### **F1 — Demand Origination**  
**Objective:** Identify SMEs seeking to make green capital expenditures (e.g., solar panels, heat pumps).  
**Actors:** SMEs, Vendors, Platform

**Mechanism:**
- SME finds financing option embedded on vendor website (e.g., “Finance This Upgrade” button), or via outreach.
- Platform captures basic company data and intent.

**Data Collected:**
- SME name, contact, registration number
- Desired equipment or upgrade
- Projected timeline and cost estimate

**Failure Point:** Low-quality inbound leads → wasted screening time  
**Success KPI:** Number of qualified SME intents per week

---

### **F2 — Eligibility & Pre-Screen**  
**Objective:** Rapidly assess whether an SME qualifies for a green loan *before* wasting bank time.

**Actors:** Platform (you), SME  
**Mechanism:** Rules-based decision engine (spreadsheet or basic form logic in MVP)

**Data Collected:**
- SME turnover, years in business, debt obligations
- ESG self-assessment (e.g., energy usage, emission type)
- Preliminary KYC (ownership, address)

**Failure Point:** Too complex → SME dropout  
**Success KPI:** 80–90% correlation with bank rejection/acceptance patterns

---

### **F3 — Vendor Quote & Impact Metadata**  
**Objective:** Collect the vendor’s quote and proof that the equipment qualifies as "green".

**Actors:** Vendor, SME, Platform

**Mechanism:**
- Vendor uploads detailed quote through a structured form
- Quote contains itemized components, expected CO₂ savings, warranty terms

**Data Collected:**
- Equipment make/model
- Estimated CO₂ savings
- Maintenance schedule
- Expected operational savings (if available)

**Failure Point:** ESG data missing or unstructured → underwriter friction  
**Success KPI:** Time from quote submission to dossier readiness < 72h

---

### **F4 — Credit Underwriting**  
**Objective:** Package data from F2 + F3 and hand it to a bank for formal approval.

**Actors:** Platform, Bank  
**Mechanism:** Submit standardised credit dossier via secure portal or API

**Package Includes:**
- SME financials
- Vendor quote + impact data
- Risk rating (optional, if you model one)

**Failure Point:** Mismatch between what bank needs and what you provide  
**Success KPI:** % of dossiers approved without back-and-forth

---

### **F5 — Disbursement & Vendor Settlement**  
**Objective:** Loan funds released to vendor; SME begins project.

**Actors:** Bank, SME, Vendor

**Mechanism:**
- Bank disburses loan directly to vendor (escrow optional)
- SME confirms equipment delivery before release

**Data/Process:**
- Final invoice
- SME approval click or digital signature

**Failure Point:** Misalignment on project status → payment disputes  
**Success KPI:** Disbursement turnaround time < 3 days post-approval

---

### **F6 — Implementation & Impact Verification**  
**Objective:** Verify the equipment has been installed and is operational.

**Actors:** Vendor, Platform, (optional: Third-party verifier)

**Mechanism:**
- Vendor submits photo evidence or telemetry
- In future: external verifier signs off (especially for grants)

**Data:**
- “Before/After” photo evidence
- Timestamped installation documents
- GPS-stamped device data (if applicable)

**Failure Point:** No verification → platform loses trust with banks  
**Success KPI:** 100% verified installations within 30 days

---

### **F7 — Covenant Monitoring & Early-Warning**  
**Objective:** Detect SME distress early; monitor green impact for portfolio reporting.

**Actors:** SME, Platform, Bank

**Mechanism:**
- Regular check-ins via automated data pulls (e.g., bank account data, energy usage)
- Score SME risk or deviation from expected impact

**Signals:**
- Energy usage drops not materializing
- Late payment patterns
- Cash-flow distress

**Failure Point:** False signals or no visibility → missed NPL mitigation  
**Success KPI:** Default prediction lead-time ≥ 90 days

---

### **F8 — Incentive Harvesting**  
**Objective:** Maximize access to subsidies, guarantees, or carbon credits

**Actors:** Platform, Government agencies, Guarantee funds

**Mechanism:**
- Match verified installations to local/national incentive schemes (e.g., KfW)
- Submit documentation on behalf of SME or lender

**Data Required:**
- Proof of implementation (F6)
- Impact KPIs (e.g., CO₂ reduced, energy saved)

**Failure Point:** Complex requirements → friction too high to claim  
**Success KPI:** €/€ ratio of public incentives unlocked vs. loans issued

---

### **F9 — Portfolio Syndication & Reporting**  
**Objective:** Package and sell the loan book or report ESG impact to external capital providers

**Actors:** Platform, Banks, Institutional Investors

**Mechanism:**
- Aggregate anonymized portfolio data
- Tag loans with EU Taxonomy codes, CSRD metrics

**Artifacts Produced:**
- Impact dashboards
- Green bond compliance templates

**Failure Point:** Low data quality → investors apply haircut or decline  
**Success KPI:** % of book that qualifies for ESG-linked capital relief or resale

---
