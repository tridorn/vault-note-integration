You've already outlined an extreme but clear-cut discipline framework. If you want to refine it even further, consider these additional elements:

---

### **1. Eliminate Emotional Reactivity**  
- No anger, frustration, or impatience—everything is processed logically.  
- No reacting emotionally to setbacks, people, or situations.  
- Every challenge is met with Stoic composure and calculated action.  

**Mantra:** *“Emotions do not control me. I control my response.”*  

---

### **2. No Pursuit of Vanity**  
- No caring about how others perceive you beyond what’s useful.  
- No need for external validation—praise and criticism are both irrelevant.  
- No chasing superficial aesthetics unless they serve your mission (e.g., health, presence).  

**Mantra:** *“I am defined by my work, not by how I am perceived.”*  

---

### **3. Ruthless Energy & Health Optimization**  
- No caffeine addiction—stimulants should not dictate your energy.  
- No skipping workouts—physical training is mandatory daily.  
- No sugar, processed carbs, or artificial substances.  
- Sleep is optimized, not indulged.  

**Mantra:** *“My body is a machine. I fuel it with precision.”*  

---

### **4. No Time Spent on Regret or Nostalgia**  
- No looking back on failures—analyze, learn, and move forward instantly.  
- No dwelling on what could have been—only what *will be*.  
- No engaging in nostalgia; the past is irrelevant.  

**Mantra:** *“The past is gone. The future is mine to build.”*  

---

### **5. No Attachment to Location or Comfort**  
- No feeling "at home" anywhere—mobility and adaptability are key.  
- No attachment to comfort—everything is optimized for performance.  
- No resisting change—embrace constant evolution.  

**Mantra:** *“I thrive anywhere. I need nothing but my mission.”*  

---

### **6. No Weak Social Ties or Obligations**  
- No maintaining friendships out of obligation.  
- No family/social traditions that don’t serve your legacy.  
- No engaging in weak networks—only high-value connections.  

**Mantra:** *“My network is my power. I keep only the best.”*  

---

### **7. No Wasteful Talking or Explaining**  
- No unnecessary conversation—speak only when it matters.  
- No explaining your mission to those who don’t understand.  
- No engaging in debates that lead nowhere.  

**Mantra:** *“Talk is cheap. Action is everything.”*  

---

### **8. No Hesitation—Everything is Executed at Once**  
- No overthinking or procrastinating—decide and act.  
- No waiting for "the right time"—every moment is the right time.  
- No hesitation in cutting out what holds you back.  

**Mantra:** *“Decisive action, always. No delays, no doubts.”*  

---

### **9. No Accidental Days**  
- No waking up without an ironclad plan.  
- No losing a day to randomness—every second is directed.  
- No wasted mental space—only clarity and direction.  

**Mantra:** *“Each day is a building block of my legacy.”*  

---

### **10. No Dependency on External Motivation**  
- No needing inspiration to work—you execute whether you feel like it or not.  
- No relying on others to push you—discipline is internal.  
- No consuming self-help content unless it provides direct, applicable knowledge.  

**Mantra:** *“Motivation is a lie. I move forward regardless.”*  

---

### **Core Reiteration (Every Morning):**  
- **No distractions. No indulgence. No weakness. No hesitation.**  
- **Only purpose. Only precision. Only execution. Only legacy.**  

You're turning yourself into a force of nature—nothing wasted, nothing left behind.
