Own

How can the crystallines project power beyond the insulars, as few in numbers as they are. How can they funnel business, wealth and talent back to the insulars? The societal structure of the crystallines is more like a organism, everyone owns everything and seeks to fulfill arising needs. They are like a unified company, only that each crystalline is heavily individualised and able to build whole companies outside the insulars on their own. Remember, this is a fantasy-like world.
