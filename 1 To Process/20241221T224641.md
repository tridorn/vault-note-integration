For a Stoic adaptation of the "noting" practice, the words you use to note should reflect key Stoic principles and provide a clear, actionable direction to gently realign your thoughts or emotions. Below is a list of suggested categories and words, broken down into themes relevant to Stoic practice:

---

### 1. **Primary Categories of Note**

	- **Thoughts:** Ideas, judgments, or mental chatter.
	- **Feelings:** Emotions or bodily sensations tied to your mental state.
	- **Actions:** Behaviors or impulses.

For each category, the note serves as a label and a prompt for redirection.

### 2. **Words To Use When Noting**

#### **Thoughts**

	- **"Judging"**: When you notice yourself forming opinions or judgments.  
	  - Example: "This meeting is a waste of time."  
	  - Redirect: "What can I control? My effort and attitude."
	- **"Assuming"**: When you're creating unverified narratives.  
	  - Example: "They must be upset with me."  
	  - Redirect: "Let me seek clarity rather than speculate."
	- **"Desiring"**: When you're attached to outcomes or external things.  
	  - Example: "I wish they’d praise my work."  
	  - Redirect: "Only virtue is good. Praise is indifferent."

#### **Feelings**

	- **"Anger"**: Frustration, resentment, or irritation.  
	  - Redirect: "Anger arises from my judgment of harm. Let me respond with justice."
	- **"Fear"**: Anxiety, worry, or avoidance.  
	  - Redirect: "Courage is the virtue here. What action is right despite this fear?"
	- **"Desire"**: Craving, envy, or yearning for pleasure.  
	  - Redirect: "Desire clouds reason. I will seek temperance."
	- **"Gratitude"**: Positive emotion worth cultivating.  
	  - Reinforce: "Gratitude aligns with virtue. Let me reflect on what I have."

#### **Actions**

	- **"Avoiding"**: When procrastinating or shying away from responsibility.  
	  - Redirect: "Avoidance weakens resolve. Let me take one step forward."
	- **"Reacting"**: When acting impulsively or emotionally.  
	  - Redirect: "Let me pause. How can I act with wisdom and patience?"
	- **"Engaging"**: Positive, intentional action.  
	  - Reinforce: "This aligns with my purpose. Let me continue with focus."

### 3. **Virtue-Based Notes**

To directly tie thoughts and emotions to Stoic virtues, you could note by virtue category:

- **"Wisdom"**: Note when you’re being rational or irrational.  
  - Example: "Is this thought true? What evidence supports it?"
- **"Justice"**: Note fairness or lack thereof in your actions or judgments.  
  - Example: "Am I treating this person fairly?"
- **"Courage"**: Note acts of bravery or avoidance.  
  - Example: "Am I facing this challenge, or am I retreating?"
- **"Temperance"**: Note moderation or excess in desires or emotions.  
  - Example: "Am I overindulging in this craving or acting with restraint?"

---

### 4. **Discipline-Based Notes**

Use the Stoic disciplines as categories to guide your practice:  
	- **"Assent"**: When agreeing with a thought or emotion.  
	  - Example: "Am I judging this event correctly?"  
	- **"Desire"**: When focusing on wants or aversions.  
	  - Example: "Am I desiring something outside my control?"  
	- **"Action"**: When evaluating choices and behaviors.  
	  - Example: "Is this action in line with virtue?"

---

### 5. **General, Non-Specific Words**

	If you're unsure which category fits, use broader words:
	- **"Distracted"**: General mental drift.  
	  - Redirect: "Back to virtue—what’s important now?"
	- **"Uncertain"**: Confusion or doubt.  
	  - Redirect: "What does wisdom suggest here?"
	- **"Centered"**: Feeling focused or aligned with Stoic principles.  
	  - Reinforce: "Stay steady; keep moving forward."

---

### Example in Action

Imagine you're in a frustrating conversation:
1. **Note**: "Judging"  
	- Thought: "They’re being rude to me."
	- Redirect: "Am I judging their intent? What’s the virtuous response?"  

2. **Note**: "Anger"  
	- Feeling: A surge of frustration.  
	- Redirect: "Anger is a signal. I will pause and choose justice over retaliation."

3. **Note**: "Courage"  
	- Action: You decide to calmly express your perspective.  
	- Reinforce: "This aligns with virtue. Stay steady."

By practicing with these Stoic-oriented notes, you gently train your mind to recognize unhelpful patterns and redirect toward virtue, helping you embody Stoicism more deeply in daily life.
