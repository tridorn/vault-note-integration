Got it -- you want a clean, rational, extensible system for YAML-based "source of truth" blocks in Obsidian that map to H2 sections in your notes.

  

Right now, your structure is functional but feels like it grew organically rather than from a single underlying logic. Let's re-engineer it from first principles.

  

I'll design a system that:

- Works across tasks, projects, evergreen notes, and content.
- Keeps YAML and body in sync without redundancy.
- Groups related metadata under meaningful top-level blocks.
- Allows easy automation and querying.
- Balances universal applicability with domain-specific flexibility.
* * *

## Proposed New Block System

  

(Top-level block names are both YAML keys and matching H2 headings.)

  

### 1.

### Identity

  

> What the note is.

  

- title
- type (concept, project, reference, log, etc.)
- aliases
- id or UUID

  

### 2.

### Context

  

> Where this note sits in the bigger picture.

  

- parent (broader note)
- children (narrower notes)
- tags
- domain / category
- related (links to parallel concepts or sibling projects)

  

### 3.

### Workflow

  

> Progress and state of work.

  

- stage (idea, draft, active, complete, archived)
- status (blocked, on-hold, review, urgent, etc.)
- priority
- due
- owner / responsible

  

### 4.

### Content

  

> The actual meat of the note.

  

- summary
- key_points
- details (body content under H2)
- questions (open queries)

  

### 5.

### Evidence

  

> Proof, references, or factual backbone.

  

- sources (citations, documents, URLs)
- quotes
- attachments
- media

  

### 6.

### Governance

  

> Policies, rules, and restrictions.

  

- sensitivity (public, internal, confidential)
- license (if applicable)
- retention (how long to keep)

  

### 7.

### Metrics

  

> Quantitative tracking.

  

- created
- last_modified
- last_opened
- access_count
- effort_logged (time spent)
- completion_%

  

### 8.

### Operations

  

> Actions you can take on the note.

  

- export_formats
- automation (scripts, triggers)
- sync_targets (where else it's mirrored)
* * *

### Why this works better

- Logical grouping: Identity → Context → Workflow → Content → Evidence → Governance → Metrics → Ops reads in a human and machine-friendly sequence.
- Universal applicability: Works for a project plan, a meeting note, a Zettelkasten evergreen, or a research log.
- Extensible: Each block is a top-level "drawer" that can hold future fields without breaking structure.
- Query-ready: Each block aligns to real YAML-friendly queries in Obsidian Dataview or similar.
- Body mapping: The same top-level names map naturally to H2 sections for in-note expansion.
* * *

If you want, I can also give you:

- A YAML template with this structure filled with placeholder values.
- An Obsidian Dataview query system that uses these blocks for dashboards.
* * *

I think your old "Flow / Taxonomy / Links / Content / Source / Govern / Metrics / Ops" is close to this -- but this rebuild organizes them around information lifecycle and meaning, rather than category type.

  

Do you want me to go ahead and map your current blocks → this new structure so you can migrate without confusion? That would make upgrading painless.
