**Corrected request**  
_"Specify the single core doctrine I operate under and the larger movement it anchors--structured, unambiguous, and free of ornamental excess."_

* * *

## 1 The Core Stream

### Name **Codex Eupatoria**

> _Purpose_ Define an immutable spine--eight axioms that cannot be overruled by policy, convenience, or sentiment.  
_Scope_ Applies first to you, then to every entity or person claiming Eupator allegiance.  
_Change-control_ Only a unanimous vote of the Protectorate Council (maximum three living members) may amend; each change must be engraved and archived in the estate vault.

| № | Axiom | Executive Meaning | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **I** | _Primacy of Logos_ | Decisions are fact-anchored; no solace in belief trumping reality. | 
| **II** | _Sovereign Agency_ | Never rent autonomy--own the levers, or walk away. | 
| **III** | _Compound Areté_ | Every process must get better on its next pass or be killed. | 
| **IV** | _Operational Truth_ | Measure what happens; publish the metric internally; tolerate no narrative that contradicts it. | 
| **V** | _Finite Loyalty_ | Loyalty is conditional on performance and shared doctrine--never on history or emotion. | 
| **VI** | _Intergenerational Duty_ | Decisions must map a minimum 30-year horizon. Anything shorter is tactics. | 
| **VII** | _Silent Footprint_ | Power never announces itself; visibility is squandered leverage. | 
| **VIII** | _Terminal Responsibility_ | The holder of the Codex absorbs all blame--no downward delegation of accountability. | 

These eight replace religion. They are the riverbed; everything else is seasonal water.

## 2 Your Personal Operating Rule

### Title **Praetor's Discipline**

1. **Daily Triad** (1) Physical training, (2) Strategic reading, (3) Silent review.

2. **Decision Gate** No irreversible move without a written _why_, signed and timestamped.

3. **Capital Test** Deploy cash only if it strengthens autonomy on a five-year horizon.

4. **Speech Constraint** Silence until you add non-obvious value; speak once, precisely.

5. **Failure Protocol** Publicly acknowledge within 24 h; draft correction plan within 72 h; archive root-cause in Vault.

The Discipline is the live software running on the Codex hardware.

## 3 The Larger Movement

### Name **The Order of Eupator**

| Layer | Function | Instrument | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **1. House Eupator** | Governance of doctrine, continuity, veto rights | Swiss Stiftung + Protectorate Council | 
| **2. Order of Eupator** | Fellowship of sworn adherents (knights, stewards, scholars) | Charter of Allegiance; annual convocation at estate | 
| **3. Venture Engine** | Economic projection--Ops Units, portfolio companies | Vienna HQ; dual-class Delaware top-co | 
| **4. Cultural Arm** | Narrative production, lore, external diplomacy | Lore Hall, publications, limited public rituals | 

Membership tiers in the Order:

| Rank | Admission Gate | Obligation | Privilege | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Sentinel** | Oath to the Eight Axioms | Annual dues, service week | Access to papers, minor counsel | 
| **Steward** | Proven delivery of Order mission | Project lead duties | Limited carry in Engine ventures | 
| **Knight** | Unanimous Council vote | Lifelong service pledge | Insignia, estate residency rights 14 nights/yr | 
| **Praetorian** | Vacancy + majority of existing Praetorians | Doctrine guardianship | Vote on Protectorate succession | 

No loose circles, no fandom--clear contract, clear duty.

## 4 Dynastic Thread beyond the Estate

1. **Doctrine (Codex Eupatoria)** -- immutable.

2. **Custodian (House Eupator)** -- holds golden share and vault.

3. **Order** -- human network executing doctrine in culture and markets.

4. **Assets** -- ventures, estates, IP produced by Order, owned through House structures.

5. **Heir Line** -- one living heir apparent, trained under Discipline, sworn to Codex.

The estate secures memory; the Order projects force; the Codex judges both.

### Implementation Next-Step

Write the Eight Axioms by hand, sign, store in the vault. Every other charter flows from that sheet--one stream, zero ambiguity.
