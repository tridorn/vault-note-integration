You should have asked: _"What is the precise, minimal, real-world process a Mission participant follows to execute structured work within this system--day to day, week to week?"_

Below is a **pragmatic walkthrough** of actual work execution inside the operating spine, from the vantage point of a Mission Member (MM), Field Officer (FO), and the structure itself.
* * *

## I. Foundational Assumptions

- Missions are **3--8 week execution units**, scoped by objective, not medium.
- Every Mission has:

    - One canonical **folder** (under version control)

    - One **Field Officer** (non-managerial support role)

    - One or more **Master Content** files (single source of truth)

    - Zero to many Outputs (slides, site, doc, product)

All work orbits around this structure.

* * *

## II. Canonical Workflow -- From Brief to Execution

### 1. **Mission Activation**

- FO creates a new branch in Git: `mission/M03-<codename>`
- Folder is scaffolded:
    
    
    missions/
    └── M03-Orion/
        ├── MasterContent.md
        ├── InterfaceContract.yaml
        ├── MetricMap.json
        ├── DecisionLog.csv
        └── assets/
    

- FO creates Mission entry in Postgres (`missions` table) via Retool
- Mission Members are added (by SSO account, via Retool or Slack bot)
- Slack channel `#m-m03-orion` created automatically

**Outcome:** A namespace and execution space exists. The Mission is ready to begin.
* * *

### 2. **Daily Work (Mission Member)**

#### At Pulse Start (daily execution window)

- Open the Mission Console (Retool)

    - See latest `MasterContent.md`

    - Check DecisionLog entries

    - Read any FO messages from the last 24h

#### Contributing

- Work locally or in cloud (e.g. Figma, VS Code, etc.)
- If creating a document, do:

    - Save output in `assets/`

    - Push it via Git (if small) or LFS (if large)

    - Reference asset in MasterContent

#### If new insight/decision made:

- Append to `DecisionLog.csv`:
    
        2025-06-15, "Renamed KPI X to Y", "Ben J.", "FO briefed, MC updated"
    

- FO reviews commit and pushes to `main` if it passes checks

#### If data or metrics are generated:

- Push update to `MetricMap.json`
- Retool dashboard auto-updates
* * *

### 3. **Weekly Work (Sprint Rhythm)**

- At end of sprint (usually weekly):

    - FO calls for a Sprint Review via Slack

    - Mission Members submit changelogs (`changelog.md`)

    - FO aggregates summary in `MasterContent.md > Sprint Review` section

    - CI tags commit with `v0.X-sprintN`

**Outcome:** Each sprint ends with an auditable version and documentation snapshot.
* * *

## III. FO Workflow (Support & Interface Role)

Daily:

- Ensure all members have access (GitHub, Retool, Slack)
- Monitor pipeline failures, CI status, and DB integrity
- Remove roadblocks: permissions, tooling, missing docs
- Enforce structure--not content

Weekly:

- Update Strategic Operations with status via Retool form
- Push compiled metrics from `MetricMap` to global `metrics.kpi`
- If critical issues, update Risk Register in `risks.register`
* * *

## IV. Medium-Agnostic Output Layer

- Whether output is a PDF, codebase, Webflow draft, or slide deck:

    - It links back to a specific commit in the Git history

    - It references the canonical `MasterContent` or `InterfaceContract`

No final output exists **outside** the mission history. There is no parallel folder on someone's desktop. That's the point.
* * *

## V. Completion / Archive

At Mission close:

- FO triggers `/archive M03` via Slack
- Pipeline:

    - Tags final commit

    - Exports key artefacts into `archives/M03-Orion/`

    - Writes `summary.json` to S3

    - Marks mission as "closed" in Postgres
* * *

## VI. Optional Add-Ons (Not Required to Function)

- Figma file linked via `assets/`
- Supabase row reference if GUI form work used
- Retool bot auto-summaries based on metric delta
* * *

## Bottom Line

Work is executed:

- Inside a **versioned, bounded folder**
- Supported by a FO, not micromanaged
- Driven by **content, not bureaucracy**
- Logged in 3 canonical files: `MasterContent`, `DecisionLog`, `MetricMap`
- Auditable via Git + SQL

This gives high agency, low sprawl, and zero ambiguity--without imposing a tool religion.
