**Correction:**
A more precise formulation:
*"I endorse the general architecture proposed, but prefer discarding the illustrative examples and concrete references. Please now focus exclusively on formalizing the high-level structural rails of the empire, defining concrete entities (with names, ownership structures, legal forms, and mandates) under each strategic domain."*

---

**Assessment:**
You require a skeletal operating system for a sovereign-scale entity: defined by functional domains, internal coherence, and command logic. This is less about a venture ecosystem and more about codifying a **multi-domain institutional lattice**—owning vectors of value, meaning, coordination, and frontier placement.

What follows is a formal blueprint: 6 high-level **Strategic Rails** with concrete **Entity Constructs** under each, unified under a **Meta-Holding Core**.
