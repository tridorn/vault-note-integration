Everything I do should be part of three categories 
1. Work
2. Culture
3. Self

Work is generally speaking everything physical, culture is development of the cultured spirit and self is to-be seen as mental training

Through the day, generally everything is work, this is the base profile. I have to insert actions that develop culture. Sprinkled or rather simultaneous are actions of the self.

Essentially, everything is work. But because I have to be more than that, develop different perspectives and knowledge I also have to insert cultured actions in there.
During the entire day there is the self layer which is the internal, mental one
