Once you've completed the schedule and built the website for your business, you can expand your skill set in various areas to elevate your business and web development abilities. Here are the further skills you might consider acquiring beyond the scope of the website:

### 1. **Advanced Backend Development**

	- **Node.js and Express**: Learn how to build your own backend services and APIs. This will give you more control over your data and infrastructure, beyond using a headless CMS.
	- **Database Management**: Learn SQL and NoSQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to better manage, scale, and optimize your data storage.
	- **Serverless Architectures**: Deepen your understanding of serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) to build scalable, event-driven backend applications.

	**Resources**:
	- [Node.js and Express Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
	- [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)
	- [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/)

### 2. **API Development and Integration**

	- **RESTful and GraphQL APIs**: Gain expertise in designing and developing APIs that can serve as the foundation for complex web or mobile applications.
	- **Third-Party API Integration**: Learn how to integrate and leverage APIs from external services like Stripe (for payments), Twilio (for communications), or Google APIs for various utilities (e.g., maps, data).

	**Resources**:

### 3. **DevOps And Cloud Infrastructure**

	- **Containerization with Docker**: Learn how to use Docker to containerize your applications, making them portable and easier to deploy across different environments.
	- **Kubernetes**: If your business or website grows and you need to manage complex, scalable systems, Kubernetes will be critical for managing containerized applications.
	- **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)**: Get familiar with cloud infrastructure, load balancing, and scaling applications. This is crucial if you're building services that need to handle more traffic.
