### Concept Definition -- **Work Unit (WU)**

| Dimension | Clarification | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Essence** | The Work Unit is a _single, canonical knowledge-space_ that fuses **scope** (what must be achieved) with **execution** (how it is done). It is _not_ an organisational body, _not_ a calendar phase, and _not_ a deliverable. It is a _logical container_ that houses all authoritative content, decisions, metrics, and interfaces necessary to complete a bounded piece of work. | 
| **Granularity** | Exactly _one_ WU exists for every **Project** (in the precise sense of a contractual scope-and-budget entity). All Missions that discharge that Project's objectives operate **inside the same WU**. Thus, a Program with three Projects will host three WUs; a single-Mission Project will host one. | 
| **Boundary** | A WU begins when a Project is approved and ends when that Project is formally closed. Nothing persists inside it beyond that lifecycle. Subsequent Projects--even if related--spin up fresh WUs; historical units are immutable archives. | 
| **Governance Anchor** | _Owner_: the Project Owner (scope authority). _Steward_: the lead Mission Commander(s) (execution authority). Governance reviews (Program Board, Campaign reviews) interrogate the WU for evidence; they do **not** duplicate artefacts outside it. | 
| **Relationship to Other Units** | • **Above**: Programs reference WUs as atomic ledger entries when allocating resources or tracking KPIs. • **Below**: Missions, Cells, Task Forces treat the WU as their exclusive source-of-truth and writeback target. No execution unit maintains a separate "mini-workspace." • **Lateral**: Support Divisions and Field Officers interact with the WU through standard Interface Contracts--never via ad-hoc channels. | 
| **Cardinality Rules** | 1 Project ➜ 1 WU (never many). 1 WU ➜ n Missions (0 ≤ n ≤ ∞). This preserves a _single narrative_ for every scoped endeavour while allowing multiple, decentralised execution streams. | 
| **Independence vs. Cohesion** | _Independence_: Missions retain full autonomy over methods and sequencing; they merely commit their artefacts back into the shared WU. _Cohesion_: Because the WU is unique per Project, fragmentation is impossible--every stakeholder knows **where** the authoritative record lives. | 
| **Abstract Deliverables** | The WU's mandatory contents are the seven company-wide artefact types (Master Content, Interface Contract, Decision Log, Signal Brief, Metric Map, Risk Sheet, Process Card). _Nothing else is structurally required_: teams may add files, but these seven remain the canonical core. | 
| **Why Not Mission-Level WUs?** | A Mission is an execution slice, not a scope boundary. Assigning one WU per Mission would multiply truth sources for the same Project, breeding divergence. Anchoring the WU at Project level keeps _one_single-source narrative while supporting any number of operational swings beneath it. | 

**In short:**  
The **Work Unit** is the _digital sovereign territory_ of a Project. It is the only officially recognised space where scope, execution artefacts, risks, decisions, and metrics co-habit. Missions may roam freely in method--but never roam outside their Project's Work Unit.
