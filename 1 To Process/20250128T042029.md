Let's restructure how you'll work with your **streamlined system** and address the relationship between **tasks** and **projects**, focusing on keeping it efficient, actionable, and clear. This will account for your GTD approach, the **large number of projects** you're managing (~150), and your goals for reducing administrative overhead.
* * *

## **System Components**

### **1. Projects**

- **Definition**: Any outcome requiring multiple steps to complete.
- **Structure**: Projects live in a **Kanban system**, which organizes them across stages:
	 - **Ideation**: Initial brainstorming and idea capture.
	 - **Planning**: Breaking down ideas into actionable steps.
	 - **Designing**: Outlining strategies, frameworks, or deliverables.
	 - **Execution**: Doing the work.
	 - **Review**: Checking for quality or progress.
	 - **Delivery**: Finalizing and handing over deliverables.
	 - **Maintenance**: Follow-up work or ongoing upkeep.
	 - **Closure**: Archiving completed projects.
* * *

### **2. Overviews**

- **Purpose**: Provide quick insights into what needs attention.
	 - `📅 Today`: Tasks scheduled for today.
	 - `🔴 High Priority`: Urgent, important tasks.
	 - `🏁 Flagged`: Tasks needing special attention.
* * *

### **3. Primary Contexts**

- **Purpose**: Organize tasks based on the type of work or mindset required.
	 - `🛡️ Focus`: Deep work tasks.
	 - `⚔️ Quick Wins`: Fast, simple tasks.
	 - `🤝 Collaborate`: Tasks requiring interaction.
	 - `📈 Growth`: Personal/professional development tasks.
	 - `📑 Admin`: Routine operational tasks.
	 - `⏳ Reflect`: Planning or introspection tasks.
	 - `🚩 On The Go`: Mobile tasks.
* * *

### **4. Secondary Contexts**

- **Purpose**: Further specify tasks based on location or tools.
	 - `🏠 At Home`: Tasks doable at home.
	 - `🏢 At Work`: Tasks for the workplace.
	 - `📞 Call`: Tasks requiring phone calls.
	 - `💻 Online`: Tasks requiring internet access.
	 - `🛒 Errands`: Tasks while out and about.
* * *

### **5. Utility**

- **Purpose**: Broad filters for organizational insight.
	 - `📆 This Week`: Tasks due this week.
	 - `🟠 Medium Priority`: Medium-priority tasks.
	 - `📌 No Context Assigned`: Tasks needing categorization.
* * *
* * *

## **How To Work with the System**

Here's a step-by-step guide for **creating tasks**, **linking them to projects**, and managing workflows effectively.

* * *

### **1. Creating Tasks**

#### **When To Create a Task**

- **On Project Creation**: For projects requiring immediate action, break down the next few actionable steps.
- **During Reviews**: Add tasks as you review progress, dependencies, or new priorities.
- **Ad Hoc**: As new ideas or obligations arise, capture them in the system.

#### **How To Create a Task**

1. **Assign to a Primary Context**: Decide what kind of task it is (`🛡️ Focus`, `⚔️ Quick Wins`, etc.).
2. **Link to a Project (if applicable)**:
	 - Add a tag or note referencing the project name.
	 - Use subtasks or checklists within project cards for clarity.
3. **Determine Priority**:
	 - Assign **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** priority to guide focus.
4. **Set a Due Date (if applicable)**:
	 - For tasks with deadlines, ensure they appear in `📅 Today` or `📆 This Week`.
5. **Add Flags (optional)**:
	 - Use flags to highlight tasks requiring follow-up or special attention.

#### **Example Task Creation**

- **Project**: Write Research Paper
	 - **Task**: "Draft outline for introduction"
	 - **Context**: `🛡️ Focus`
	 - **Priority**: 🟠 Medium
	 - **Due Date**: End of the week
	 - **Link**: Note/tag referencing "Write Research Paper"
* * *

### **2. Managing Projects**

#### **Organize Projects in Kanban**

- **Ideation**: Dump new ideas here until you're ready to act.
- **Planning**: Define scope, goals, and initial tasks.
- **Execution**: Actively work on tasks in this stage.
- **Review/Delivery**: Use milestones or key deliverables to track progress.

#### **Tie Tasks to Projects**

- Tasks live in your GTD system but reference projects explicitly:
	 - Use **tags**, **project names in task titles**, or **notes** for clarity.
	 - Example: `[Write Research Paper] Draft outline for introduction`.

#### **Track Project Progress**

- Periodically review:
	 - How many tasks are left for each project.
	 - Which stage the project is in (via Kanban).
	 - Dependencies or roadblocks (via task details).
* * *

### **3. Daily Workflow**

1. **Morning Setup**:

	 - Check `📅 Today` to see scheduled tasks.
	 - Review `🔴 High Priority` for urgent items.
	 - Select a few key tasks for `🌟 Focus for Today`.
2. **Task Execution**:

	 - Work from **primary contexts** (e.g., `🛡️ Focus` for deep work or `⚔️ Quick Wins` for energy dips).
	 - Use **secondary contexts** (e.g., `📞 Call`, `🏠 At Home`) to filter tasks based on your current situation.
3. **Evening Wrap-Up**:

	 - Mark completed tasks.
	 - Move incomplete tasks to appropriate lists (e.g., `📆 This Week` or `📌 No Context Assigned` for review).
	 - Update project Kanban statuses as needed.
* * *

### **4. Weekly Workflow**

1. **Review Projects**:

	 - Check each project's status in the Kanban system.
	 - Identify:
		  - Which projects need to move to the next stage.
		  - Stalled projects requiring attention.
2. **Review Tasks**:

	 - Check `📆 This Week` and `🏁 Flagged` for outstanding actions.
	 - Add or adjust tasks based on project updates.
	 - Ensure tasks reflect current dependencies or priorities.
3. **Plan for the Week**:

	 - Assign next actions for priority projects.
	 - Update due dates and contexts as necessary.
* * *

### **5. Managing Dependencies**

#### **Action Dependencies**

- For sequential tasks, explicitly reference dependencies:
	 - Example: "Read Chapter 1 (before Chapter 2)."
- Tag dependent tasks as `@Blocked` or include notes explaining dependencies.

#### **Project Dependencies**

- Projects awaiting external input or another project's completion should move to **Blocked** or **Waiting** in Kanban.
* * *

### **6. Simplifying Task Overload**

1. **Limit Active Projects**:

	 - Focus on 5-7 active projects at a time.
	 - Keep the rest in **Planning** or **Blocked** stages.
2. **Minimize Administrative Work**:

	 - Avoid micromanaging tasks. Focus on:
		  - Assigning clear **next actions** for each project.
		  - Updating project statuses weekly, not daily.
3. **Batch Similar Tasks**:

	 - Group calls, errands, or admin work into blocks for efficiency.
* * *

## **How Tasks and Projects Work Together**

1. **Projects Provide Structure**:

	 - They define the overall goal and stages.
2. **Tasks Drive Action**:

	 - Tasks represent the actionable steps needed to progress the project.
3. **Kanban Bridges the Gap**:

	 - Use Kanban to track project stages and progress.
	 - Reference the task system for detailed execution.
* * *

## **Summary Workflow**

1. **Morning**:

	 - Check `📅 Today`, `🔴 High Priority`, and your Kanban for active projects.
	 - Select key tasks for the day.
2. **Throughout the Day**:

	 - Execute tasks from **primary contexts**.
	 - Use **secondary contexts** to filter based on location or tools.
3. **Evening**:

	 - Mark tasks as complete.
	 - Update project statuses in Kanban as needed.
4. **Weekly Review**:

	 - Review project progress in Kanban.
	 - Adjust tasks and priorities for the coming week.

This setup balances **action clarity**, **project structure**, and **administrative simplicity**, keeping your system manageable while supporting 150+ projects. Let me
