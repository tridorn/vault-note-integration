As discussed, the insulars will be sprinkled around the world, huge in size themselves, however paling in comparison to the world itself. These huge mountain masses (similar to the concept of the lonely mountain) are standing tall where magic lines cross (they formed through the magic coming in contact with each other). I want them to be perfectly placed to become the focal point for the surrounding areas, however not in such a way that it is absolutely inevitable to not come across them. Essentially with perfect geography for logistics, trade, economy but as described kind of inaccessible. I like the idea of the magic lines crisscrossing to have some kind of properties that allows for faster travel or any other advantage similar to rivers in our world, that on the magical lines themselves trade routes traverse and settlements of other races develop. The crystallines could use and develop these routes themselves before they innovate the instantaneous connection between the insulars. This would of course mean that the insulars are more in the focus of other races, as they use the paths of the magic lines themselves (which lead to the insulars). Design a possible geography concept for this world with all the previous information in mind. Thank you.
