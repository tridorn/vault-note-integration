You most likely don‘t know, but there is quite the large time span (like a few months) between my last request and this one right here, so I‘m probably less in context than you. To kind of reiterate and draw the frame for my point: The crystallines should be focused entirely (not solely, there are of course the other factors) on business, achieving maximum efficiency, productivity, wealth creation etc. Essentially "line (on a graph) go up". While the set up as described gives each race basically the same overall "stats" I designed this race and scenario to achieve a dominant position (dominant in the context of the goals of this race, that means more pulling the strings in the background) at some point down the line (also because I identify with them or rather want to design them as my own ideal race). The insulars are the economic centers and unmovable fortresses. They should be basically impenetrable by anyone and as such safe havens for the crystallines to retreat to. I don‘t want to go over everything regarding the insulars again, let me just contrast the safety, persistency and comfortability of the insulars to the volatile surroundings. The insulars are the main economics centers of the crystallines and can grow without contact to the external world, the crystallines still venture out from them to get access to other ressources, information, power, ideas, etc. I also envision larger cycles in which the world goes from dark time to golden eras. In the dark times the crystallines will retreat the insulars while in the golden times expand their influence outwards again (or similar). In video games there is a hard cap on development, at some point one reaches the end of what is defined through code. One could compare it to resources in the real world (at some point all of the coal is going to be dug up), however, humans are able innovate without an arbitrary limit (limitless). Now to get to my point: As I said, insular will be these dots (even tho the insulars are huge themselves, the world is even larger) sprinkled through the world, interconnected and should be unconquerable by the "chaos forces" outside. The confines of the insulars are reached however at some point. Do you got any ideas for how the crystallines could still grow indefinitely?
