To develop, deploy, and use a single currency for foreign influence, the Crystallines would need to create a monetary system that is attractive, trustworthy, and advantageous for both domestic and foreign entities. Here's a strategic approach they could take:

1. **Currency Development**:
   - **Magically Enhanced Currency**: Develop a currency that incorporates their unique magic, making it more secure and difficult to counterfeit. This could involve magical signatures, spells that verify authenticity, or other enchanting features.
   - **Universal Acceptance**: Design the currency to be easily exchangeable and acceptable across different races and nations. This may involve setting stable exchange rates or ensuring its value is backed by tangible assets or the Crystallines' reputation.

2. **Initial Deployment**:
   - **Pilot in Trade Hubs**: Initially introduce the currency in major trade hubs and entry points, allowing external traders to familiarize themselves with it.
   - **Incentives for Use**: Provide incentives for using the Crystalline currency, such as lower transaction fees or favorable exchange rates.

3. **Building Trust**:
   - **Financial Stability**: Demonstrate the stability and reliability of the currency through sound monetary policies managed by the Crystalline central bank.
   - **Transparency**: Maintain transparency in monetary policies to build trust among foreign users.

4. **Integration in International Trade**:
   - **Trade Agreements**: Encourage or mandate the use of the Crystalline currency in trade agreements, especially for valuable commodities or magical goods unique to the Crystallines.
   - **Loans and Aid**: Offer international loans, aid, or investments in the Crystalline currency, gradually integrating it into foreign economies.

5. **Economic Influence**:
   - **Control of Currency Flow**: Use the currency as a tool to influence economic policies and decisions in other nations by controlling its flow and availability.
   - **Interest Rates and Investment**: Manipulate interest rates or provide investment opportunities to foreign entities to further integrate the currency into global markets.

6. **Digital or Magical Currency Platform**:
   - **Innovative Platform**: Develop a digital or magical platform for currency transactions, offering ease of use, security, and speed, making it more appealing than traditional currencies.

7. **Safeguards and Regulations**:
   - **Anti-Inflation Measures**: Implement measures to prevent inflation, ensuring the currency retains its value over time.
   - **Legal Framework**: Establish a legal framework for the use of the currency across different jurisdictions, addressing issues like fraud, theft, or disputes.

8. **Cultural and Political Influence**:
   - **Cultural Exchange**: Promote cultural exchanges funded by the Crystalline currency, enhancing its prestige and desirability.
   - **Diplomatic Channels**: Use diplomatic channels to persuade other nations to adopt the currency, highlighting its benefits.

By carefully implementing these strategies, the Crystallines can create a currency that is not only a medium of exchange but also a tool of economic and political influence on a global scale.
