### **Overview Of Azoria**

Azoria is an enormous, newly accessible continent with a diversity of regions that offer distinct resources and geographic features. These features form natural trade routes and economic opportunities that converge at The Sundered Basin. Its major landmarks—the inland sea (Heartsea), the central mountain (Mount Aurelia), and the Great River (Aurelia’s Vein)—serve as the heart of this emerging economic powerhouse. The surrounding regions provide resources, routes, and opportunities that enrich and sustain the basin’s development.

### **Key Regions of Azoria**

1. **The Central Plateau (Aurelia Plateau)**:
	- **Location**: Surrounding Mount Aurelia, this plateau stretches over 200 miles in every direction from the central peak.
	- **Terrain**: Fertile, high-altitude grasslands interspersed with river valleys, offering ideal land for settlement and agriculture.
	- **Resources**: Excellent for grain production, livestock, and some mineral resources, particularly copper and iron near the foothills of Mount Aurelia.
	- **Role in Trade**: The plateau will likely house the continent’s first major inland settlements, and goods from this region flow down Aurelia’s Vein to the basin, supporting the basin’s role as the trade center.

2. **The Iron Highlands**:
	- **Location**: Northeast of the Aurelia Plateau, these highlands span hundreds of miles, leading up to the rugged foothills of the Guardian Mountains.
	- **Terrain**: Rocky hills, mineral-rich cliffs, and winding rivers.
	- **Resources**: Rich in iron and other base metals, these highlands hold significant mining potential. Small deposits of silver and coal also add value.
	- **Role in Trade**: Raw metals are transported to the basin by river or caravan, fueling a burgeoning iron and steel industry that supports infrastructure, shipbuilding, and tools for settlers.

3. **The Verdant Expanse**:
	- **Location**: West of the Guardian Mountains, this region stretches along the western coast and is traversed by numerous rivers flowing from the mountains into the western sea.
	- **Terrain**: Dense forests and fertile plains, with a warm, humid climate.
	- **Resources**: Timber, exotic wildlife, and medicinal plants make this region highly valuable. Certain trees produce fragrant resins, spices, and rare woods.
	- **Role in Trade**: Timber and botanical resources are transported through the Guardian Mountain passes or up rivers to the basin. As settlements grow, the basin may establish an export market for luxury goods, including incense, herbal remedies, and textiles derived from exotic plants.

4. **The Golden Plains**:
	- **Location**: South of the basin, stretching hundreds of miles towards the southern coast.
	- **Terrain**: Open, expansive grasslands perfect for agriculture and grazing.
	- **Resources**: Fertile soil supports vast wheat, barley, and corn fields. Herds of bison-like animals and wild horses roam these plains, and settlers quickly establish ranching operations.
	- **Role in Trade**: The Golden Plains provide a stable food supply and are ideal for large-scale farming, with grain and livestock flowing north to the basin. The plains also offer ideal conditions for horse breeding, allowing the basin to develop a cavalry force and a horse-trading market.

5. **The Shimmering Desert**:
	- **Location**: Far to the southwest, beyond the Golden Plains.
	- **Terrain**: Arid desert with salt flats and high dunes, punctuated by oasis towns.
	- **Resources**: Salt, precious stones, and unique minerals like desert glass. Oases support limited agriculture, particularly dates, figs, and olives.
	- **Role in Trade**: Salt caravans and rare gemstones find their way to the basin, where they are traded as luxury items. The basin could establish a “Silk Road”-style route through the desert, allowing for cross-continental trade.

6. **The Crystal Coves**:
	- **Location**: A coastal region southeast of the basin.
	- **Terrain**: Rocky shores and calm bays, dotted with natural sea caves that shimmer with crystal deposits and rare shellfish.
	- **Resources**: Crystals, pearls, coral, and rare fish. The crystal caves are a natural wonder that attracts early settlers and may support a tourism economy.
	- **Role in Trade**: The coastal beauty and valuable pearls make this a destination for the wealthy. The basin exports pearls, coral, and crafted crystal goods.

7. **The Eastern Marshlands**:
	- **Location**: East of the basin, beyond the Iron Highlands.
	- **Terrain**: Expansive marshes and wetlands, interwoven with rivers that drain into Heartsea.
	- **Resources**: Rich peat, reeds for papermaking, medicinal herbs, and unique fish and waterfowl.
	- **Role in Trade**: This region supplies reeds for papermaking, a key export that enables record-keeping and documentation for settlers. The basin could also develop an industry around medicinal products derived from marsh herbs.

8. **The Frosted Peaks**:
	- **Location**: Far to the north, beyond the Iron Highlands.
	- **Terrain**: Snow-capped mountains and deep valleys, home to some hardy tribes and rich mineral deposits.
	- **Resources**: Precious metals, especially gold, and gems such as sapphires and rubies. The cold climate supports fur-bearing animals.
	- **Role in Trade**: Gold, furs, and precious gems are shipped south to the basin, where they are sold or exported. These resources make the Frosted Peaks attractive to adventurous settlers and miners.

### **Trade Routes and Economic Networks**

1. **The Great River Network**:
	- Aurelia’s Vein is the primary route, connecting Mount Aurelia and the central plateau directly to Heartsea. Branching tributaries serve as arteries to other regions, allowing goods to flow toward the basin and enabling settlers to transport supplies inland.
	- Riverboats are crucial for trade in the basin, and a network of docks, barges, and small settlements forms along the river, serving as waypoints for goods and people.

2. **The Southern Caravan Road**:
	- A major overland route, known as the **Golden Route**, runs from the Golden Plains to the basin, serving as a primary agricultural supply line. From here, goods move by river or sea to distant lands.
	- Another branch of this route extends southwest to connect with the Shimmering Desert, creating a land-based trade network that transports salt, gems, and desert products.

3. **Western Timber and Herbal Trade**:
	- The **Verdant Way** passes through the Guardian Mountains, providing a rugged but direct route to the basin. This path allows lumber, medicinal herbs, and exotic animals to reach Heartsea, feeding a valuable and growing export economy.

4. **Northern Mineral Routes**:
	- The **Highland Route** connects the Iron Highlands and Frosted Peaks to the basin. It is initially a challenging route but grows as demand for metals and gems increases.
	- Over time, fortified trade posts and towns emerge along this route, offering rest and resupply for caravans moving between the basin and the mineral-rich north.

5. **Crystal Coast Shipping Lanes**:
	- Coastal trade develops between the Crystal Coves and Heartsea, establishing a water route for pearls, coral, and crystal goods. Eventually, luxury traders, tourists, and artisans settle along the coastline, fueling a niche economy for high-value goods.
