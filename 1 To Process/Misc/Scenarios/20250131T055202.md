You've got it right—the inland sea is indeed like a basin, surrounded on all sides by mountains, with one side connecting to the ocean through a narrow strait. Let me clarify these points in more detail to give a clearer sense of scale, distance, and why this region has the potential to become a trade hub:

### Geographic Layout

1. **The Inland Sea (The Basin)**:
	- **Size**: The inland sea is roughly the size of a large lake, about 80-100 miles across at its widest points. This size makes it large enough to support several harbors and allow for diverse shipping routes, but it’s still sheltered by surrounding mountains, which keeps the waters calm.
	- **Shape**: It’s mostly oval, with irregular shores that vary from steep cliffs to gentle beaches, allowing for multiple potential port locations.
	- **Climate and Waters**: Thanks to geothermal springs, the water temperature remains moderate year-round, which prevents freezing in winter and supports year-round navigation—a valuable trait in a colder climate.

2. **The Surrounding Land Basin**:
	- **Distance to Mountains**: The land around the inland sea stretches between 20 and 30 miles before reaching the encircling mountains. This creates a fertile, temperate basin with plains, forests, and river systems fed by the mountains. The mild climate and fertile soil make it suitable for farming, settlements, and supporting a population.
	- **Terrain**: The terrain consists of lush lowlands near the water’s edge, followed by dense forests and scattered rocky outcrops closer to the mountains. This basin acts as a natural cradle, rich in resources like timber, arable land, and small deposits of minerals.
	- **Rivers**: Small rivers from the mountains drain into the inland sea, creating strategic areas for agriculture and minor inland trade.

3. **The Mountains and the Ocean Connection**:
	- **Mountain Range**: The mountains, though not impassable, are rugged and daunting, forming a natural barrier that protects the basin from overland invasion and isolates it from inland regions of the new continent.
	- **The Strait**: The ocean-facing side of the mountains has a narrow, twisting strait that serves as the only natural outlet from the inland sea to the open ocean. This strait, about half a mile wide at its narrowest, is crucial as it can easily be fortified to control all access to the sea.

### Location and Distances

1. **Distance from the Old Kingdom**:
	- **Sea Route**: The Sundered Bay is approximately 400-500 miles away from the old kingdom by sea. This would typically take around 2-3 days of steady sailing with favorable winds, or slightly longer depending on conditions. While close enough for trade, it’s far enough to be somewhat autonomous, reducing the kingdom’s ability to quickly intervene or protect its interests here.
	- **Isolation**: There is no land route connecting the old kingdom to this new continent, emphasizing its remoteness. Ships and sea routes are the only way to reach it, giving the new lord effective autonomy.

2. **Proximity to Other Lands**:
	- **New Continent’s Inland**: Beyond the mountains surrounding the basin, the new continent stretches for hundreds or even thousands of miles into largely unknown territory. The exact nature of these lands is uncharted, with only rumors and reports of various tribes, scattered natural resources, and unexplored wilderness.
	- **Potential Trade Connections**: To the north of the basin, on the far side of the continent (perhaps 600-700 miles inland), there are rumored to be other realms and tribes who are mostly unknown to the old kingdom. This offers the potential for trade with these distant lands, if safe routes through the continent can be discovered.

### Why The Sundered Bay Could Become a Trade Hub

1. **Strategic Chokepoint and Maritime Control**: The strait is the only natural entrance to the inland sea from the ocean. By fortifying this chokepoint, the new lord controls access, enabling tolls and safe passage fees. Merchant ships would be incentivized to pass through here rather than taking a longer, more dangerous route.

2. **Economic Value and Unique Goods**:
	- **Local Resources**: The basin is rich in natural resources, including fish, exotic pearls, minerals, and geothermal-heated medicinal plants. Over time, these resources could be exported, attracting merchant interest from the old kingdom and other distant regions.
	- **Trade With Inland Tribes**: The new lord could establish trade routes with inland tribes of the new continent, exchanging goods like metals, tools, or finished products for exotic raw materials or specialty items from the continent’s interior.
	- **Resupply and Repair Port**: The bay could become a stopping point for ships making long voyages. Its safe harbors and year-round accessibility allow it to serve as a resupply and repair hub, which could make it essential for sea merchants traveling further afield or exploring the new continent.

3. **Growth Potential**:
	- The inland sea can support harbors, warehouses, and trade ports, allowing the new lord to expand infrastructure as trade grows. 
	- By controlling this passage, the new lord can charge fees for passage, grow trade networks, and even set up a customs system, gradually expanding influence and drawing a population of merchants, tradesmen, and settlers.

In summary, The Sundered Bay sits strategically as a maritime chokepoint between the known world and an untapped new continent. Its isolation allows the new lord relative autonomy to build it into a trade hub, and its unique resources give it potential economic appeal, despite its distance and challenging geography.
