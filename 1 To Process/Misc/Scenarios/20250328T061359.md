Sure, I can certainly help with that. Here are a few characters and their arcs:

1. **Ethelion, the Sage**: Ethelion is one of the oldest Crystallines, known for his wisdom and mastery over mental magic manipulation. Initially, he serves as the primary guide for his people, helping to lay the foundations of their society. However, as time passes, he becomes more reclusive, retreating to the depths of his insular to pursue esoteric knowledge. Ethelion reemerges during critical periods of crises, providing guidance and helping his people navigate difficult situations. His arc is one of growth, wisdom, and sacrifice, as he often has to give up personal pursuits for the good of the Crystallines.

2. **Xerendite, the Warrior**: Xerendite begins his journey as a young, hot-headed warrior, eager to prove himself. Over time, he earns recognition and respect, eventually leading the Crystallines' armies in many battles. However, his thirst for victory leads him to a dark path, where he starts experimenting with destructive forms of magic. He disappears for a while, only to reappear as a changed being. His arc is a story of redemption, as he tries to make up for his past mistakes and regain the trust of his people.

3. **Lumyra, the Artisan**: Lumyra starts as a humble artisan, crafting beautiful objects out of the magic-infused minerals. Her work is appreciated but not widely known. A series of events leads her to create a magical artifact of immense power, making her famous among the Crystallines. However, the fame brings unwanted attention, and she decides to retreat from public life. Lumyra reappears at different periods, her creations playing significant roles in the history of the Crystallines. Her arc revolves around the theme of creativity, power, and the price of fame.

4. **Obsidian, the Rogue**: Once a hero, Obsidian becomes disillusioned with the Crystallines' society and turns rogue. His actions lead to conflicts and damage, but also force the Crystallines to address certain flaws in their society. Obsidian reappears at different periods, serving as an antagonist but also a catalyst for change. His arc explores themes of rebellion, disillusionment, and the potential for change.

These character arcs are designed to intertwine with the main storyline, adding layers of depth and complexity to your world. They can be modified and expanded to fit your narrative better.
