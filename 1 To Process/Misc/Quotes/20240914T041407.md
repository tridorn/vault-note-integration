# Stoic Quotes

> Often a very old man has no other proof of his long life than his age.  
-- Seneca , On the Shortness of Life

> Begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life.  
-- Seneca

> Awareness, not age, leads to wisdom.  
-- Publilius Syrus

> When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love  
-- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

> Epicurus rejected any possibility of an afterlife, while still contending that one need not fear death: "Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us." From this doctrine arose the Epicurean Epitaph: *Non fui, fui, non sum, non curo* ("I was not; I have been; I am not; I do not mind."), which is inscribed on the gravestones of his followers and seen on many ancient gravestones of the Roman Empire.

> Bear and forbear
