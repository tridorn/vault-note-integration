## Quotes

> You always had to remain on guard to avoid getting sucked in. People masterfully attempted all forms of social corruption. I immediately forwarded all presents I received to the field hospitals and thanked the donors in the name of the wounded soldiers. One incorrigible individual, the abbot of the Pannonhalma Arch-Abbey, did not get the message. He incorrectly concluded that the wine he had sent to me was insufficient or not good enough. He sent me a larger and better case of wine. I sent it straight back with a letter, noting my regret that as a German general officer I was neither able to accept gifts nor in a position to reciprocate. Someone else tried to bribe me with a land grant, but to the frustration of the careful negotiator in the attempted process I pretended that I was too dumb to understand.  
-- Hermann Balck, Order in Chaos
