# Quoting Fictional Characters

Quoting fictional characters can be a nuanced endeavor. Whether you attribute a quote to the character or the author often depends on the context in which you're sharing the quote and the information you want to convey.

## Quoting for Context

This is nothing but a simple and short test to ensure that I amtest  
If you're quoting a fictional character to discuss or highlight the nature of the character, the plot, or the fictional universe, then it's useful to attribute the quote to the character. This way, the reader or listener immediately understands the fictional context.

```markdown
> "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."
— Albus Dumbledore, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*
```

## Quoting for Universal Truths or Wisdom

If the point of sharing the quote is the universal truth or wisdom contained within, and not necessarily the character or story itself, then you might want to attribute it to the author, since they're the original source of the thought.

```markdown
> "It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."
— J.K. Rowling, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*
```

## Including Page Numbers

Adding page numbers is a good practice, especially for academic or scholarly work where precise sourcing is required. For casual sharing, it's often not necessary. But if you want to be thorough, it's a good habit.

```markdown
> "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."
— Albus Dumbledore, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, p. 333
```

## Quoting Multiple Characters

Sometimes, the meaning or impact of a quote is best understood when multiple characters are involved. In such cases, you might want to include both characters for context.

```markdown
> "After all this time?" 
> "Always," said Snape.
— *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* by J.K. Rowling
```

## In General

- **Yes, you can quote fictional characters**. This is common in literary analysis, reviews, and discussions where the context of the fictional setting is important.
  
- **Attribution style depends on your purpose**. Consider what you want the reader to focus on: the character, the broader narrative, the wisdom of the quote, or the author's intent.
  
- **Page numbers are optional but helpful**. They're especially important if you want others to find the exact location of the quote in a source.

Remember, the primary goal of attribution is to give credit to the original source and to provide context for the reader. Choose the format that best serves that purpose for your specific situation.
