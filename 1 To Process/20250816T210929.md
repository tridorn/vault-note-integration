---

This is an excellent place to pause and clarify -- because you're spotting the heart of how a venture studio / compounder hybrid functions. The mechanics of follow-ons, external rounds, and the HoldCo's role can get confusing unless you think in layers. Let's strip it down and be rational.
* * *

# 1. Does HoldCo fund follow-ons in its own OpCos?

  

Yes, but selectively.

- The default expectation is that HoldCo will participate in future rounds (especially early ones) of the companies it spins up.
- That's what protects your pro-rata ownership (so you don't get diluted to nothing).
- This is what people mean by "follow-on capital."

  

ðŸ‘‰ But: HoldCo doesn't have to lead every round, nor always keep majority. You apply the capital allocation rules:

- If unit economics + moat are proven â†’ double down.
- If not â†’ slow/no follow-on, maybe invite external investors.
* * *

# 2. Wouldn't that skew the cap table in favour of HoldCo?

  

Only if HoldCo is the only one writing checks. Let's compare two models:

  

### (A)

### Closed Loop Funding

###  (HoldCo only funds)

- Cap table drifts toward HoldCo over time.
- Founders get diluted alongside ESOP.
- Looks more like a corporate lab than a venture partnership.
- Problem: founders may feel like glorified managers, not true owners.

  

### (B)

### Open Loop Funding

###  (HoldCo + external investors)
- HoldCo writes pro-rata or sometimes super-pro-rata checks.
- External VCs/growth investors join the cap table.
- Everyone gets diluted -- but founders + ESOP maintain real skin.
- HoldCo preserves meaningful ownership/control (esp. with rights & vetoes), but doesn't creep to 80--90% and kill founder psychology.

  

ðŸ‘‰ The healthiest model is B.

HoldCo funds early and opportunistically later, but brings in outside capital when growth requires it.

This builds validation, network effects, and discipline -- not just money.
* * *

# 3. So do external investors invest in PlatformCos?

  

Yes -- selectively.
- When a PlatformCo needs scale capital (e.g. â‚¬20--30m growth round), external VCs/PE funds step in.
- HoldCo can:

    - Keep pro-rata (if it has the cash).

    - Or allow mild dilution but keep board control & protective rights.
- External investors typically accept this if the business is strong and governance is clear.

  

Why involve externals at all?

- They bring networks, validation, and extra firepower.
- They "mark" the company to market, raising HoldCo's NAV.
- They share risk -- HoldCo doesn't bankroll everything alone.
* * *

# 4. Where does the Investment Arm fit?

  

Think of the Investment Arm (Sidecar/Co-Invest Fund) as an overflow valve.

- Suppose a PlatformCo needs â‚¬30m.
- HoldCo wants to maintain control but only has â‚¬10m capacity.
- The Investment Arm (with external LPs) invests â‚¬15m alongside.
- Maybe an external growth fund takes the last â‚¬5m.

  

Result:

- HoldCo keeps control.
- Investment Arm earns fees/carry.
- External investors see aligned terms.

  

This prevents the "skewed cap table" problem: HoldCo isn't forced to over-concentrate its balance sheet just to protect ownership.

* * *

# 5. The rational structure of the model

  

### HoldCo's role

- Seed + early capital (0--18 months).
- Selective follow-ons (esp. in winners).
- Capital allocation across the whole portfolio (70/20/10 rule).
- Governance & playbooks are the real control mechanism -- not just share %.

  

### External investors' role

- Supply scale-up capital when ventures are proven.
- Provide validation and "outside-in" discipline.
- Take minority positions without control.

  

### Investment Arm's role

- Bridge ticket-size gaps.
- Earn modest management fees + carry.
- Keep control in the "family" while supplementing firepower.
* * *

# 6. Why this matters (what you're

# not

#  building)

- You're not a traditional VC â†’ you don't rely on external LPs for 100% of capital.
- You're not a corporate incubator â†’ you don't own 80--90% and leave founders under-incentivized.
- You're not a sovereign allocator â†’ you don't just spray across assets.

  

Instead: you're a Compounder Studio.

- Own enough (35--60%) to justify resources + shared stack.
- Preserve founder upside so they build like owners.
- Use external capital strategically, not reflexively.

# 7. A simple illustration (PlatformCo A, Year 0 â†’ Year 5)

  

At formation (seed by HoldCo):

- HoldCo: 40%
- Founders: 45%
- ESOP: 15%

  

Series A (external VC + HoldCo follow-on):
- New â‚¬10m round. HoldCo puts in â‚¬3m, external VC â‚¬7m.
- Post-round: HoldCo 35%, Founders 40%, ESOP 12%, VC 13%.

  

Series B (scale-up, external-led):

- New â‚¬30m round. HoldCo puts in â‚¬5m, VC syndicate â‚¬25m.
- Post-round: HoldCo 32%, Founders 34%, ESOP 10%, VC syndicate 24%.

  

Year 5 outcome:

- Company worth â‚¬300m.
- HoldCo stake (32%) = â‚¬96m.
- Founders + team still own ~44% = â‚¬132m.
- Everybody's rich, aligned, motivated.
- HoldCo hasn't overextended its balance sheet but remains the single largest shareholder.

# ðŸ”‘ Key insight

  

> Follow-ons don't inherently skew cap tables -- they would if HoldCo was the only funder. But with external investors, dilution is spread across all, and governance rights let HoldCo protect its influence even if equity % drifts lower.

  

HoldCo's power = capital allocation + governance + shared ops leverage, not necessarily always >50% equity.

Would you like me to sketch a visual timeline chart (ownership % shifting across Seed â†’ Series A â†’ Series B) so you can see how founders, HoldCo, and external investors dilute together while control stays intact?
