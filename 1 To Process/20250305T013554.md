To develop **Askeladd-level intelligence, clarity, and strategic thinking**, you must train yourself to **see reality without illusion, process information faster, and manipulate situations to your advantage**. Intelligence in this sense is not just about raw IQ—it is a **hyper-pragmatic, multi-layered way of thinking** that balances **logic, manipulation, and foresight**.

---

## **1. Train Your Mind for Strategic Thinking**
Askeladd **thinks in contingencies**—he never makes a move without considering its consequences **five steps ahead**. You must train yourself to **analyze, predict, and control events**.

### **A. Think in “If-Then” Statements**
- Never just react—**pre-think** multiple responses to every situation.
- Before acting, ask:  
  **“If I do X, then what are the possible outcomes?”**  
  **“If someone does Y in response, how do I counter it?”**  
  **“If this plan fails, what is my fallback strategy?”**
- Example: Instead of **arguing impulsively**, **set traps** in conversations where people discredit themselves.

### **B. Play Strategy Games Daily**
- Chess (teaches tactical and positional play).  
- Go (teaches long-term dominance and sacrificing for gain).  
- Poker (teaches risk assessment, reading opponents, and deception).  
- *Crusader Kings III* / *Total War* (teaches power consolidation and geopolitical maneuvering).  

### **C. Adopt “Three-Layer Thinking”**
Instead of focusing only on **what is happening**, ask:  
1. **Surface Level (What seems to be happening?)**  
2. **Hidden Level (What is actually happening beneath the surface?)**  
3. **Strategic Level (How can I control what happens next?)**  

---

## **2. Develop Ruthless Clarity (See the World As It Is)**
Askeladd’s strength comes from **understanding human nature with brutal honesty**. To develop this clarity:

### **A. Destroy Your Emotional Biases**
- When analyzing events, **strip away your emotional attachments**—see people as they are, not as you wish them to be.  
- Example: If someone betrays you, **don't focus on anger—analyze what made them do it and how to prevent it next time**.  

### **B. Study Human Nature (Persuasion & Manipulation)**
- Read:  
  - *The 48 Laws of Power* (Robert Greene) – Master deception and control.  
  - *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion* (Robert Cialdini) – Learn to manipulate decisions.  
  - *The Art of Seduction* (Robert Greene) – Master charm and charisma as tools.  
- Practice:  
  - **Social deduction games** (*Mafia*, *Werewolf*, *Poker*)—train yourself to read lies and tell them.  
  - **Cold reading people**—guess their weaknesses, motivations, and desires through observation alone.  

### **C. Learn to Read Power Structures**
- In any situation, ask:  
  **“Who actually holds power here?”**  
  **“What does each person want?”**  
  **“Who can be used, who must be removed?”**

## **3. Make Your Thinking Sharper & Faster**
Askeladd is never caught off-guard because his **mental processing speed is ahead of everyone else’s**. You need to sharpen both **logical clarity and real-time adaptability**.

### **A. Train in Rapid Problem-Solving**
- **Read difficult material, then summarize it in one sentence**—forces clarity of thought.  
- **Speed chess**—forces fast strategic calculation under time pressure.  
- **Timed debates**—forces quick response formulation.  

### **B. Master the Art of Deception & False Signals**
- **Control what people perceive about you**—make them see what benefits you.  
- **Set false weaknesses**—Askeladd lets people think he is just a “smart mercenary” when he is playing **a much deeper game**.  
- **Use red herrings in arguments**—learn to misdirect people from your true goals.  

---

## **4. Develop Tactical Emotional Control (Weaponize or Suppress Emotion)**
### **A. Train Emotional Composure**
- **Put yourself in high-pressure situations intentionally** (public speaking, high-stakes social interactions, or even combat sports).  
- **Use meditation and Stoic practice** to detach from strong emotions before reacting.  
- **In arguments, slow your breathing and delay your responses**—this forces control over emotional impulses.  

### **B. Learn When to Show Emotion as a Tool**
- **Fake vulnerability** to make people lower their guard.  
- **Express controlled anger** to intimidate when needed.  
- **Appear uncertain** to make others overcommit in negotiations.

## **5. Shape Events Instead of Reacting to Them**
✔ **Anticipate Future Events** – Before entering any situation, predict what is likely to happen.  
✔ **Create Pressure Points** – Push people toward decisions without them realizing it.  
✔ **Let Others Think They Have Control** – People will resist direct control, but if they believe they’re acting on their own, they will follow you willingly.  

### **A. Plan Social & Business Moves in Layers**
- **Step 1 (Short-Term Play):** Immediate manipulation (deception, redirection, persuasion).  
- **Step 2 (Medium-Term Play):** Shift perception (reputation, positioning).  
- **Step 3 (Long-Term Play):** Set up **unstoppable outcomes** months or years in advance.  

**Example:** Askeladd plays along with Prince Canute's rivals **while secretly orchestrating their downfall**. You must learn to **manipulate both enemies and allies** without them realizing it.

## **6. Be Unreadable & Uncontrollable**
✔ **No one should ever fully understand you.**  
✔ **People should think they know what you want—but be wrong.**  
✔ **Never reveal your full capabilities until it is too late.**  

---

## **7. Master Askeladd’s Ultimate Skill: The “Burn It All” Move**
✔ **When necessary, sacrifice everything for the true goal.**  
✔ **No attachments should stop you from winning.**  
✔ **If the game is unwinnable, flip the board instead.**  

Askeladd’s final act—**killing King Sweyn and forcing Canute into power at the cost of his own life**—was a **perfect example of calculated destruction**. If you truly want to think like Askeladd, **you must be willing to make drastic moves when required**.

---

## **Final Blueprint: How to Develop Askeladd’s Mind**
✔ **Think in layers—never act on only one level at a time.**  
✔ **Manipulate perception—control what others think they see.**  
✔ **Use deception strategically—mislead, misdirect, and plant false information.**  
✔ **Analyze human nature—learn what drives people and exploit it.**  
✔ **Plan multiple moves ahead—never act without predicting consequences.**  
✔ **Remain emotionally unreadable—reveal only what benefits you.**  
✔ **Never get attached to anything you’re not willing to burn.**  

This is the true **Askeladd mentality**—**a mind that never rests, a game always being played, and a future being shaped long before anyone else even realizes it.**
