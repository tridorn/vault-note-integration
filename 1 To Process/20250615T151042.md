### V. **Governance & Review Mechanisms**

_Defines the formal checkpoints where the system holds itself accountable. These are not optional meetings, they are institutional rituals--time-bound events where authority is exercised, outcomes are judged, and change is authorized._

* * *

#### 5.1 **Review Rituals**

Each cadence unit embeds a mandatory review. These are non-negotiable, fixed in time, and outcome-bound.

| Cadence | Ritual | Owner | Core Function | Output | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Pulse** | Sync Check | Cell Lead + FO | Daily alignment; surface blockers | Logged issues | 
| **Sprint** | Sprint Review + Retrospective | Mission Lead | Delivery assessment + team reflection | Sprint Report | 
| **Mission** | Midpoint + Closeout Review | FO + SO Liaison | Validate trajectory, extract lessons | Mission Scorecard | 
| **Program** | Monthly Review | Program Director + SO | Synchronize missions, resolve interdependencies | Program Summary | 
| **Campaign** | Quarterly Review | SO + Council | Strategic performance assessment | Campaign Report | 
| **Season** | Annual Reset | Council | Reorient doctrine, budget, portfolio | Strategic Mandates | 

_If a unit does not complete its review, its next planning cycle is blocked until remedied._

* * *

#### 5.2 **Performance Model**

Your system must measure performance _at the unit level_, not at the individual level. Review = assessment of structural fitness and execution effectiveness.

| Unit | Evaluation Vector | Metrics (examples) | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Mission** | Execution Effectiveness | Objective completion rate, delivery velocity, quality deviations | 
| **Program** | Cohesion & Load Balance | Resource utilization, mission interlock delay, cumulative risk | 
| **Campaign** | Strategic Validity | Goal alignment, budget efficiency, mission ROI | 
| **SD** | Service Reliability | SLA compliance, escalation frequency, FO satisfaction | 
| **SO** | Planning Fitness | Forecast accuracy, doctrine applicability, planning cycle time | 
| **FO** | Facilitation Impact | Escalation efficiency, morale signals, mission feedback loops | 

_No metric is standalone. Quantitative and qualitative indicators must be triangulated during reviews._

* * *

#### 5.3 **Escalation Protocols**

The system must protect against inertia, role ambiguity, and structural failure. Escalation protocols serve as _release valves_to prevent systemic breakdown.

| Trigger | Threshold | Escalation Path | Resolution Owner | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Support Failure** | SLA missed 2 consecutive sprints | FO → SO Logistics → SD Lead | SD Lead | 
| **Mission Drift** | Mid-Mission checkpoint deviation >25% | FO → SO Ops Planning | SO | 
| **Doctrine Friction** | 2+ Missions flagging same constraint | SO Doctrine Cell → Strategic Council | Council | 
| **Campaign Instability** | Budget overrun or strategic miss >20% | SO → Campaign Sponsor + Council | Council | 
| **Personnel Conflict** | Threatens mission integrity | FO → People Division + SO | People Division | 

_Escalation must be logged, not whispered. Every trigger must have a corresponding countermeasure._

* * *

#### 5.4 **Doctrine Evolution**

Doctrine is not eternal. It is revised _rhythmically_, not reactively.

| Mechanism | Description | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Doctrine Review Cycle** | Once per Season. Managed by SO Doctrine Cell. All proposed changes must cite empirical feedback. | 
| **Change Submission** | Any unit (Mission, FO, SD, SO) may submit doctrine revision requests. Template-based, must reference friction pattern. | 
| **Version Control** | Doctrine has semantic versioning (`v3.2.1`). New versions ratified by Council. Missions may not shift mid-run. | 
| **Release Cadence** | Doctrine updates enter effect only at Season start, never during Campaigns or Missions. | 

_If doctrine can change at any time, it ceases to provide coherence. Temporal gating protects both agility and stability._

* * *

#### 5.5 **Failure Handling**

Systemic resilience depends on _codified responses to failure_. No blame, no improvisation--only structured diagnosis.

| Failure Type | Response | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Mission Failure** | Sprint and Mission Reviews analysed by SO. If systemic, triggers Doctrine Review. If isolated, FO documents root cause. | 
| **Support Collapse** | Reviewed by SD Lead + SO. SLA redrafted or resource allocation adjusted. | 
| **Council Misalignment** | Detected via SO planning friction or IH feedback loops. Triggers facilitated Council session. | 
| **Execution-Strategy Drift** | Identified during Campaign or Season reviews. May result in campaign cancellation or re-scoping. | 
* * *

### Summary

Governance is not bureaucracy--it is the immune system of your operating structure. These rituals ensure clarity, discipline, and legitimacy. Without them, your system will silently decay into informal hierarchy, personality-driven decisions, and tactical reactivity.
