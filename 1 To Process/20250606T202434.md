**Correction:** A clearer phrasing would be, _"Given that I am at operational zero with Eupator, what are the exact next steps--prioritised, sequential, and minimally sufficient--to move from concept to functioning business?"_
* * *

## PHASED EXECUTION PLAN: ZERO TO OPERATIONAL BUSINESS

Your constraint is **attention**. The goal is not to "set up everything" but to **create a functioning core** that can sell, deliver, and learn--fast. Avoid any action that doesn't directly generate insight, credibility, or cash.
* * *

### PHASE 1 -- FOUNDATION (1--3 Days)

**Objective:** Establish legitimacy, structure, and a functional client interface.

#### 1. Legal & Administrative (Germany)

- Choose legal form: initially **GbR** (if alone or with partner) or **Einzelunternehmen** for speed.
- Secure domain: `eupator.de`
- Register email domain via Google Workspace (or Zoho for leaner cost structure).
- Set up invoicing: Use **Debitoor**, **Lexoffice**, or **Zervant** to handle Rechnungen and VAT-compliant records.
- Create your **business bank account** (e.g., Qonto, Kontist, or Holvi for solo ops).

#### 2. Digital Spine

- Set up **Google Workspace**: create [eupator@eupator.de](mailto:eupator@eupator.de), drive, calendar.
- Install **Notion**: create workspace structure:

    - CRM board

    - Project tracker

    - Audit template (checklist, scoring system, improvement plan)

    - SOP base (how to run an audit, how to onboard freelancers)
- Create Google Drive structure:

    - /Clients

    - /Templates

    - /Reports

    - /Assets
* * *

### PHASE 2 -- OFFER BUILDING (2--4 Days)

**Objective:** Create a clear, sellable audit offer, priced and ready for delivery.

#### 3. Define your initial product

- One **fixed-scope digital audit** with:

    - Clear deliverables (PDF report + optional Loom summary)

    - 2--3 price tiers based on depth
- Scope areas:

    - Website speed & UX

    - Basic SEO

    - Conversion flow / usability

    - Technical infrastructure
- Use scoring system + actionable recommendations
- Build 1 dummy audit as internal reference or showcase

#### 4. Setup delivery process

- Use **Google Docs** template for the audit report
- Use **Loom** to record walkthroughs (standard format: Intro → Findings → Recommendations)
- Prepare intake form via **Tally.so** or **Typeform** (embedded later into site)
- Add all this into Notion as a repeatable delivery flow
* * *

### PHASE 3 -- CLIENT-FACING PRESENCE (2--5 Days)

**Objective:** Make it possible for a client to understand, trust, and buy.

#### 5. Build one-page site

- Use **Framer** or **Carrd**
- Structure:

    - What you do: "Digital Audit für kleine Unternehmen"

    - Who it's for: [Niche, Region, Use Case]

    - What they get: e.g., "PDF-Bericht + Videoanalyse + Handlungsempfehlungen"

    - Pricing: simple tier table (entry, standard, premium)

    - CTA: "Audit anfragen" → leads to intake form

#### 6. Setup LinkedIn Company Page

- Logo, one-sentence description, link to site
- Connect it to your public persona
- Post one article/insight showing competence
* * *

### PHASE 4 -- MARKET SIGNAL (5--10 Days)

**Objective:** Get validation, real leads, and case material.

#### 7. Outreach to warm targets

- Prepare cold message template (signal expertise, not spam)
- Start with known business owners, local SMEs, or connections
- Offer "First 5 audits free/at cost" to build 3 strong case studies

#### 8. Deliver 3 real audits

- Run them through your template
- Record Loom walkthroughs
- Extract anonymised results for site and LinkedIn
- Capture written testimonial where possible

#### 9. Gather insight

- What did clients ask most about?
- Where did they push back on pricing or scope?
- What part of the audit had the biggest perceived value?
* * *

### PHASE 5 -- OPERATIONALISATION (Ongoing)

**Objective:** Systemise delivery, refine offer, prep for delegation.

#### 10. Build repeatable process

- Document each part of delivery in Notion
- Isolate which parts you can start to outsource (e.g., page speed analysis, SEO scan)
- Create contractor brief templates

#### 11. Cash control

- Track revenue and costs tightly
- Know your margin per audit
- Identify which lead sources convert
* * *

## SUMMARY: YOUR NEXT 5 MOVES

1. Register Eupator (GbR or Einzelunternehmen), secure domain + email

2. Build operational stack: Google Workspace + Notion + Drive

3. Finalise audit offer and build delivery pipeline

4. Launch website + LinkedIn presence with clear CTA

5. Execute first 3 real audits, extract insight + testimonials

You now have a **sellable offer**, a **repeatable delivery process**, and **market feedback**. Everything beyond this is growth logic: acquisition strategy, service expansion, and margin optimisation.

Tell me if you want templates (audit format, SOPs, outreach message). I'll prepare them.
