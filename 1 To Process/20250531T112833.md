A cleaner prompt would be:  
**"From my present German tax residence, which jurisdiction is the optimal seat for a future umbrella holding vehicle (with the option to convert into a foundation), and what sequence of steps gets me there before I move to Dubai in four years?"**

* * *

## 1 Selection criteria you cannot escape

| Criterion | What you really need | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **German exit frictions** | Avoid § 12 KStG's corporate "liquidation fiction" when POEM leaves the EU ([NWB Datenbank](https://datenbank.nwb.de/Dokument/262955/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). | 
| **Withholding-tax drag on German cash-flows** | After the 2022 treaty lapse Germany--UAE dividends land in a 26.375 % vacuum ([Crowe](https://www.crowe.com/de/hsa/en-us/news/discontinuation-of-the-dta?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [skwschwarz.de](https://www.skwschwarz.de/en/news/tax-aspects-of-moving-from-germany-to-dubai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). | 
| **Treaty network for future, non-German assets** | Access to broad DTT grid for inbound dividends and capital gains. | 
| **Foundation regime** | Ability to migrate shares to a succession-proof, founder-controlled foundation once the 5-year ErbStG clock after emigration has expired. | 
| **Substance burden now** | You refuse any foreign management effort before leaving Germany. |

## 2 Short-list of plausible apex jurisdictions

| Seat | German WHT on dividends* | Corporate exit tax risk in 4 y | Treaty network | Foundation option | Substance needed today | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **German GmbH** | 0 % inside group; 26.375 % if paid to you in UAE (no treaty) | None (company stays German) | Excellent for EU only | Can donate to _foreign_foundation after 5 y abroad | Nil | 
| **Dutch BV / Co-op** | 15 % standard, 0 % for Co-op if anti-abuse passed ([PwC Tax Summaries](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/netherlands/corporate/withholding-taxes?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | **Yes** -- POEM→UAE triggers § 12 KStG because no EU residence remains ([NWB Datenbank](https://datenbank.nwb.de/Dokument/262955/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Very broad | Dutch "STAK" or Liechtenstein Stiftung later | Board minutes + local director now (you reject) | 
| **Luxembourg Soparfi** | 15 % → 0/5 % under treaty; anti-abuse manageable | Same § 12 trap | Broad | SPF or Fondation Patrimoniale | Local director + files (you reject) | 
| __Liechtenstein Stiftung (corporate_)_* | 15 % WHT under DE-LI treaty ([PwC Tax Summaries](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/liechtenstein/individual/foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | None (seat never German, POEM outside) | 20+ treaties incl. DE | Native foundation regime | Requires professional council, not you | 
| **UAE ADGM Foundation** | 26.375 % (no treaty) | Not relevant -- seat already Dubai | Growing, but no EU shield | Built-in | Formation possible only after you move | 

*Assumes you will eventually extract some cash; staying fully "dry" forever is rarely realistic.

## 3 Realpolitik assessment

1. **EU hold-cos do not save you.**  
Without real EU management, § 12 KStG taxes every hidden reserve inside the BV/Soparfi the day you shift to Dubai. The EU seat alone is useless.

2. **German GmbH is cheap and compliant with your no-substance stance.**  
You face only _personal_ Wegzugsteuer on your shares in 2029; the company itself remains untouched.

3. **The real optimisation window opens _after_ you have been non-resident for five full years.**  
At that point German gift/estate tax drops away; you can move the shares into a foundation anywhere without ErbStG •§ 2 reach.

4. **Liechtenstein and ADGM are the only foundation regimes that combine asset-protection statute, migration-in capability, and low ongoing tax.**  
-- Liechtenstein needs a professional council today (outsourced, no POEM problem).  
-- ADGM can be set up once you are already in the UAE; no German WHT relief, but by then your German operating entities can be ring-fenced in a lower tier.

## 4 Playbook that actually works

| Phase | Action | Tax cost | Substance burden | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **0 -- 6 months** | Form **German GmbH** as master holding. Capital € 25 k, credibility for investors; no foreign management required. | None | None | 
| **Years 1-4 (Germany)** | Accumulate ventures under the GmbH. No dividends to you; all cash compounds inside Germany at 29-32 % effective CIT/trade tax. | Normal German corporate tax | None | 
| **Month 48 -- Personal exit** | Relocate to Dubai; pay one-time **Wegzugsteuer** on latent gain of GmbH shares (§ 6 AStG). Opt for the 7-year instalment scheme with bank guarantee. | 27--28 % on unrealised gain | None (personal move only) | 
| **Years 4-9 (Dubai, but still within 5-year ErbStG and 10-year § 2 window)** | Keep GmbH dividends un-distributed or pay modest management fees to your UAE person (< €62 k p.a.) to stay below § 2 thresholds. | German WHT avoided by not distributing | You control GmbH remotely (POEM Dubai irrelevant because GmbH is German entity) | 
| **After 5 years abroad** | Transfer GmbH shares by gift to **ADGM or Liechtenstein foundation** (now outside German gift tax). | None in Germany, nominal in UAE/LI | Foundation council manages; you keep governance rights as Protector | 
| **Optional later** | Re-domicile new non-EU ventures directly under the foundation; leave German assets in the GmbH or gradually de-Germanise by asset sale. | WHT friction only on residual German profits; treaty choice depends on where next subsidiaries sit | Foundation administration only |

## 5 Verdict

Because you categorically refuse to organise foreign management until you live abroad, any EU or EEA holding is a fiscal boomerang; § 12 KStG will tax it on departure. The **only structure that respects both your current constraints and your future Dubai domicile is a German GmbH today, followed by a controlled migration of the _shares_ (not the company) into a foundation after the statutory clocks expire**.

Choose between an **ADGM foundation** (seamless geographic fit but no German WHT relief) and a **Liechtenstein foundation** (marginally better treaty network and zero Liechtenstein WHT). In either case, the heavy lifting occurs when you are already outside Germany's personal tax net--exactly where your leverage is highest.
