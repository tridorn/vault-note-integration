**Precise phrasing:** "Define a compartmentalised, secure, and efficient digital ecosystem that distributes my five devices across four identities: private life, public-persona writer, Eupator agency, and salaried employment."
* * *

## Strategic segmentation

1. **Four discrete identities**  
• Private  
• Public persona (thought-leadership, content)  
• Eupator (client work, contractors, finances)  
• Employer (all contract-bound obligations)

2. **Three isolated clouds**  
• iCloud → private only  
• Google Workspace (Eupator) → public persona and agency  
• Employer Office 365 → employment tasks  
Never mingle storage or sign-ins across clouds.

3. **Single password vault**  
1Password or Bitwarden, business plan, enforced 2FA, four vaults mapped to the identities.

## Device allocation

| Device | Role | Rationale | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Desktop** | Master archive, heavy analysis, cold storage backups | Stationary, reliable, easiest to secure. | 
| **Microsoft Surface** | Employer work only | Keep corporate compliance and VPNs isolated. | 
| **iPad Pro** | Public persona creation, light Eupator review | Ideal for writing, markup, social posts. | 
| **Chromebook** | Risk-tolerant web research, contractor onboarding | Stateless OS, quick resets, strong sandboxing. | 
| **Good iPhone** | Dual-SIM: private + Eupator comms (separate apps) | Always on hand, top camera quality for content. | 
| **Bad iPhone** | Field recorder, MFA hardware token, test bed | No personal data, ok if lost or compromised. | 
* * *

## Identity hardening on each device

1. **Separate OS log-ins or profiles**  
Windows: distinct user accounts.  
macOS/iPadOS: focus-mode profiles and keychain separation.  
ChromeOS: multiple Google profiles.

2. **Containerised apps**  
• Outlook (Employer) vs Gmail (Eupator) vs Proton (Private).  
• Slack/Teams limited to employer profile only.  
• Social posting tools (Buffer, LinkedIn) installed exclusively in the public-persona workspace.

3. **Zero cross-sync rules**  
No browser sync across identities. Use Firefox for private, Chrome for Eupator, Edge for employer.

## Data flow diagram

Input (client or personal)  
→ Stored in correct cloud bucket  
→ Processed on device mapped to same identity  
→ Output delivered through dedicated comms channel

Leak path monitoring: quarterly audit of cloud-connected apps via Google security check-up and iCloud device list.

## Core routines

| Cadence | Action | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Daily | Quick inbox triage in each identity, 15 min cap per inbox. | 
| Weekly | Full backup of Eupator workspace to encrypted external drive attached to Desktop. | 
| Monthly | Revoke unused cloud tokens, rotate passwords marked "shared". | 
| Quarterly | Device patch review and hardware inventory reconciliation. |

## Result

You obtain strict role separation, minimal cognitive switching cost, and clear forensic trails. This structure also scales: add or retire devices without rewriting the policy, simply reassign within the matrix.
