Yes, **you should enforce a strict complementary-role composition**. Reject redundant-role teams (e.g., dual-business or dual-technical) as default configuration. Here's the structural rationale:

* * *

## 1. **Redundancy Dilutes Accountability**

When two founders share overlapping functions:

- Decision-making slows down due to unclear authority lines
- Ego clashes arise over "who leads what"
- Role scope inflation or underutilisation occurs (someone always drifts)

Example: Two business co-founders = one will dominate external ops (fundraising/sales), the other defaults into middle management or vague "strategy".

* * *

## 2. **Investor Perception Penalty**

Seed investors pattern-match. Teams without technical ownership or overly redundant biz backgrounds are flagged immediately.

- **All-biz teams** are often seen as "consultants playing startup"
- **All-tech teams** can build but fail to sell
- **Mixed teams** signal execution readiness across verticals

Insisting on triadic complementarity increases fundability and institutional respect.

* * *

## 3. **Execution Surface Maximisation**

Startups must:

- Build a product
- Sell/market it
- Understand and operate within a specific domain

Each founder must own and defend one of these fronts **solely**. Overlap is inefficiency. Missing one is fatal.

* * *

## 4. **Prevents Social Engineering of Teams**

Allowing dual-biz or dual-tech setups invites the formation of comfort-zone cliques. Co-founders pick their friends or lookalikes, not what the company needs. Enforcing functional complementarity **makes the company the selector**, not the founders.

* * *

## Implementation: Enforcement Mechanism

- **At Matching Phase:** Auto-reject configurations with overlapping declared primary functions (e.g., two CEOs, two product managers).
- **If overqualified candidate insists on joining existing config:** They can only join _as a substitute_, not an addition.
- **No more than one founder per role-domain per team.** Use strict mapping: Tech | Biz | Domain | (Optional Design/Product, only if it addresses a specific need).
* * *

## Exception Handling

Allow _temporary exceptions_ only when:

- A solo technical founder has built a working MVP and needs a business co-founder, but no domain founder yet
- The domain founder has market lock-in (e.g. medical regulation edge) and is seeking both tech and commercial co-founders

But these are **exceptions to bootstrap speed**, not defaults.

* * *

## Final Note

Your credibility and operating leverage as a startup factory come from ruthless role-clarity. Venture creation is not democratic--it is functional. Complimentary, not comfortable.
