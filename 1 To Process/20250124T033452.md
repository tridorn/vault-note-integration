Since you're starting with Nuxt.js, TypeScript, and more advanced web development concepts but don’t have prior experience, here’s a structured plan to help you build your skills while progressing on your website project:

### 1. **Foundations First**

	Before diving deep into Nuxt.js and TypeScript, it’s helpful to solidify the basics:
	
	- **JavaScript Mastery**: Make sure you’re comfortable with JavaScript fundamentals, including ES6+ features (like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, promises, etc.).
	- **TypeScript Basics**: Learn the basics of TypeScript, such as static typing, interfaces, generics, and classes. There are quick tutorials or even interactive platforms like [TypeScript Exercises](https://typescript-exercises.github.io/).

	**Resources**:  
	- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) (JavaScript fundamentals)
	- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

### 2. **Nuxt.js Basics**

	- **Nuxt.js Documentation**: Start by following Nuxt’s official docs. They’re designed to be beginner-friendly, so going through the step-by-step guide will help you get familiar with Nuxt’s core concepts (SSR, routing, components).
	- **Vue.js Basics**: Since Nuxt.js is built on Vue.js, learn the fundamentals of Vue.js if you haven’t already. Understand components, the reactivity system, and the Vue lifecycle hooks.

	**Resources**:  
	- [Nuxt.js Documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/get-started)
	- [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/) (Vue.js-focused platform with beginner and advanced content)
	

### 3. **Progress To TypeScript in Nuxt.js**

	Once you're familiar with Nuxt and Vue.js, start integrating TypeScript into your project. Nuxt.js has built-in support for TypeScript, but learning how to use it properly will take some time.

	**Key Topics to Learn**:
	- TypeScript decorators in Vue components
	- Type inference and using TypeScript in Vue single-file components (SFCs)
	- Nuxt.js with TypeScript configuration
	
	**Resources**:
	- [TypeScript Support in Nuxt.js](https://typescript.nuxtjs.org/guide/setup/)

### 4. **Advanced Concepts (Gradual Integration)**

	As you progress, start tackling more advanced topics:
	- **State Management with Vuex**: Nuxt.js uses Vuex for state management, so familiarize yourself with state management principles.
	- **API Integration**: Learn how to use Nuxt.js’ async data methods and Axios module to fetch data from APIs.
	- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Nuxt is known for SSR, so learning how to manage SSR with dynamic content, hydration, and caching will be essential.
	- **Advanced TypeScript Concepts**: Focus on integrating TypeScript with these advanced topics, learning how to manage complex types and TypeScript decorators.

	**Resources**:  
	- [Nuxt.js State Management (Vuex)](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/store)
	- [Axios Module for API Calls](https://axios.nuxtjs.org/)

### 5. **Project-Based Learning**

	The best way to learn is to work on your project while studying. Create your website step-by-step and try to implement each concept after learning it. Focus on building small features with the technology you just studied before expanding your project.

	**Project Ideas**:
	- **Routing and Layouts**: Start by building a basic multi-page site using Nuxt’s dynamic routing and layouts system.
	- **Static vs. Dynamic Pages**: Experiment with static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR).
	- **API Integration**: Build a small blog or portfolio by fetching data from a headless CMS like Strapi or a JSON API.

### 6. **Stay Consistent & Seek Help**

	You’ll likely run into challenges, but consistency is key. StackOverflow, Nuxt.js community forums, and Discord channels can help when you're stuck. Regularly working on your project and reviewing what you've learned will help solidify your skills.

	**Resources**:  
	- [Nuxt.js Forum](https://cmty.app/nuxt)
	- [Nuxt.js Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nuxt)

This structured approach will gradually take you from no experience to being able to build a robust website using Nuxt.js, TypeScript, and modern web development concepts. Would you like to dive into a specific topic first?
