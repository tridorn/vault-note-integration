For optimal efficacy within the **IEHN Protocol**, the frequency of micro-actions should strike a balance between establishing habit familiarity and avoiding burnout or frustration. Repetition is crucial but must be paced judiciously to foster adaptive exposure without overwhelming your motivation. Below is a structured guideline for repeating micro-actions within the protocol:

---

### **Frequency Guidelines for Micro-Actions Within the IEHN Protocol**

#### **1. Initial Stage: Establishing the Foundation**

	- **Frequency**: **2–3 times per day per target action**.
	- **Rationale**: Early, frequent engagement creates a familiarity with the action. However, too many repetitions can induce aversion rather than reduce it. Aim for only a few, focused interactions daily to prevent excessive emotional strain.
	- **Example**: If your target action is studying, begin by setting up your study space 2–3 times daily, perhaps once in the morning, afternoon, and evening, without pressuring yourself to study immediately.

#### **2. Intermediate Stage: Building Comfort and Initial Adaptation**

	- **Duration**: After 1 week of initial daily repetitions.
	- **Frequency**: **Once daily per target action**, with periodic “mini-sessions” throughout the week.
	- **Rationale**: As you become more comfortable, the need for high-frequency repetition decreases. By spacing out the action to once daily with occasional reinforcement, you avoid habituation fatigue while solidifying a positive association.
	- **Example**: Transition from setting up the study space multiple times a day to just once, incorporating a slightly extended engagement (e.g., setting up and reading one paragraph).

#### **3. Advanced Stage: Progressive Compounding and Habit Reinforcement**

	- **Duration**: After 2–3 weeks of the intermediate stage.
	- **Frequency**: **3–4 times per week**, with incrementally extended engagement.
	- **Rationale**: By now, each action should feel less intimidating, and repetition can be reduced further to prevent diminishing returns. At this stage, extend the action itself slightly (e.g., from reading one paragraph to reading a page).
	- **Example**: Set up your study space 3–4 times a week, each time adding a small, manageable layer of action, such as writing a quick summary of what you read.

#### **4. Maintenance Stage: Cementing Habitual Neutrality**

	- **Duration**: After 4–6 weeks of advanced stage compounding.
	- **Frequency**: **1–2 times per week**, focusing on natural integration.
	- **Rationale**: As the action becomes increasingly normalized, repetition can further taper off. Focus on performing it within its natural context rather than a scheduled repetition. This stage ensures the habit is embedded without conscious reinforcement, transitioning it into an automatic routine.
	- **Example**: Gradually shift from scheduled sessions to integrating study into your day whenever you naturally feel able to do so, treating it as a standard component of your routine.

### **Adjustments For Varied Resistance Levels**

If you find particular actions induce *more resistance* even after repetition, extend the initial stages (e.g., maintaining 2–3 daily micro-actions for an extra week). Conversely, if resistance diminishes quickly, proceed to the next stage without prolonging.

By following this frequency model, you can establish familiarity without inducing over-exertion, adapting each task naturally into your behavioral repertoire.
