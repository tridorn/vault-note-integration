### 1 INSTITUTIONAL PLACEMENT

| Layer (from L-2) | Entity Type | Legal Shell | Ownership Path | Purpose | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Stiftung**(sovereign core) | -- | -- | **Ultimate owner** | Sets doctrine, approves funding envelopes. | 
| **Eupator AG**(Swiss holding) | For-profit holding | Swiss AG | 100 % by Stiftung | Pays out R &D / culture grants; appoints boards of satellite non-profits. | 
| **Institute / Think-Tank Cluster** | Non-profit (Verein, gGmbH, gAG, 501(c)(3)) | Separate shells per geography | 100 % voting control by Eupator AG (or majority board seats) | Produce V0/V1 research, policy, media. | 
| **Eupator GmbH (Vienna)** | For-profit ops | Austrian GmbH | 100 % by AG | Supplies research staff on secondment; turns doctrine into product lines. | 

**Why not place institutes directly under the Stiftung?**  
• Keeps sovereign layer legally clean (charitable institutes can be litigated).  
• Allows cash-flow via AG dividends and service contracts--transparent, auditable, scalable.  
• Maintains one-step insulation from sensitive Codex material.

* * *

### 2 GOVERNANCE HOOK

- Institutes receive annual **Mandatum** from Eupator AG, signed by Triumvirate.
- Sentinel Core seats one observer on each institute board--silent veto on doctrinal drift.
- Archivist receives quarterly research archive for long-term vaulting.

Result: public face remains "independent," yet strategic steering sits with the AG (and thus the Stiftung).

### 3 GEOGRAPHIC GRID

| Function Focus | City / Region | Rationale | Legal Shell | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **EU policy & academia** | **Vienna** (flagship "Institute for Structured Continuity") | Proximity to HQ campus; access to EU research money; neutral image. | Austrian _Verein_ or _gGmbH_ | 
| **Regulation & lobbying** | **Brussels** | On-site EU decision making; narrative seeding. | Belgian _ASBL_ (non-profit) | 
| **Anglo-American discourse** | **London** | Media density; think-tank ecosystem; English-language legitimacy. | UK _Company Limited by Guarantee_ | 
| **US tech-policy conduit** | **Washington DC** | Direct line to US legislators; DoD/NIH grant surface. | 501(c)(3) foundation | 
| **Emerging-world outreach** | **Dubai** or **Singapore** | Bridge to GCC & ASEAN capital; ideological export to growth regions. | Local non-profit or free-zone foundation | 

_All shells hold identical bylaws derived from a master charter approved in Zug._

### 4 VEIL ALLOCATION

| Veil | Carried Mainly By | Public Output | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **V0 (exoteric)** | Media arms, press op-eds | Popular articles, podcasts, social feeds | 
| **V1 (semiotic)** | Institutes & think tanks | White papers, policy briefs, conferences | 
| **V2 (esoteric)** | Training programmes at Vienna institute | Invite-only seminars, fellowships | 
| **V3 (sovereign)** | Estate, House archives | Never public | 

Institutes therefore **live in V1**, bridging public narrative and doctrinal depth without exposing inner machinery.

* * *

### 5 IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

1. **Year 0--1** Set up Viennese flagship as _gGmbH_; fund via AG grant (€150 k seed).

2. **Year 2** Spin Brussels ASBL; staff seconded analysts; initial EU policy papers.

3. **Year 3** Launch London guarantor company; run annual "Continuity Summit."

4. **Year 4--5** Open DC 501(c)(3); apply for US federal research grants.

5. **After Year 5** Dubai/Singapore node if Gulf or ASEAN expansion justified.

All boards report annually to Eupator AG in Zug; AG board relays condensed report to Stiftung for veto/approval.

### 6 SUMMARY LOGIC

- **Control** stays invisible (Stiftung → AG → board seats).
- **Credibility** comes from local, legally distinct non-profits.
- **Propagation** uses Veil V0/V1 outputs to seed ideology.
- **Security** ensured by Sentinel observers and Archivist vaulting.

Thus every think tank and institute is a **public lighthouse fed by a private power‐plant**, perfectly aligned with the doctrine yet insulated from its inner sanctum.
