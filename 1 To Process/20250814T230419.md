Yes -- this has become a real strategic point in the last few years.

Germany has indeed tightened its scrutiny on people and companies shifting to Dubai (or any low-tax jurisdiction), especially when it looks like the move is mainly for tax purposes.

  

If you don't prepare properly, you can end up:

- Still treated as German tax resident despite moving.
- Hit with exit taxes on unrealized gains.
- Under audit for years if the Finanzamt suspects "continued economic ties."

  

Let's break it down rationally.

* * *

## 1. The Main German Risks When Moving to Dubai

  

### A. Tax Residency Trap

- Germany applies the 183-day rule and the "center of vital interests" rule.
- Even if you live in Dubai, you may still be considered German tax resident if:

    - You keep a home in Germany (own or rent).

    - Your spouse/children remain in Germany.

    - You still run your business from Germany (seen as management/control located in DE).

  

Result: You'd owe German income tax on worldwide income -- defeating the point of the move.
* * *

### B. Exit Tax (Wegzugsbesteuerung)

- Applies if you own â‰¥1% of shares in a corporation (including your GmbH or future holding).
- On moving tax residence abroad, Germany treats it as if you sold those shares -- taxing unrealized gains.
- This can create a massive upfront tax bill even if you haven't sold anything.
- Deferrals are harder now -- for moves outside the EU/EEA (like Dubai), you generally must pay immediately unless you negotiate special security arrangements.
* * *

### C. Management & PE (Permanent Establishment) Risk

- If the German tax office can prove your Dubai company is "effectively managed" from Germany, they can tax it as if it's German.
- This can happen if:

    - Board meetings happen mostly in Germany.

    - Major contracts are signed while you are physically in Germany.

    - The "mind and management" of the company is still seen to be in DE.
* * *

### D. Continued German-Source Income

- Income from German clients or property can still be taxed in Germany even after you move.
- If not structured right, this can keep a substantial part of your earnings under German rates.
* * *

## 2. Strategies to Prevent Early Mistakes

  

### A. Clean Residency Break

- Fully give up German residence (abmelden at Einwohnermeldeamt).
- Sell or terminate rental on any German home.
- Move family, personal belongings, and major bank accounts.
- No dependent children in German schools.
* * *

### B. Pre-Move Corporate Restructure

- If you own shares in a GmbH:

    - Option 1: Sell to a foreign holding before moving (may trigger tax now, but avoids higher future valuations).

    - Option 2: Move the GmbH under a foreign parent (requires careful planning to avoid exit tax).

    - Option 3: Reduce ownership below 1% before moving (loses control though).
* * *

### C. Document Your "Center of Life" in Dubai

- Lease or buy Dubai residence before leaving Germany.
- Shift all key business activities to Dubai:

    - Sign contracts there.

    - Hold board meetings there.

    - Hire core staff there.
- Keep flight/travel logs -- prove your physical presence in UAE.
* * *

### D. Minimize Ongoing German Exposure

- If you keep German clients, invoice them via your Dubai entity.
- Avoid long stays in Germany (over 60--90 days/year can raise questions).
- If you must travel for business, keep all decisions and signatures offshore.
* * *

## 3. Risk Mitigation Timeline

  

6--12 Months Before Move:

- Engage German tax lawyer specialized in emigration.
- Value your shares for potential exit tax calculations.
- Start IP migration and change where contracts are signed.

  

3--6 Months Before Move:

- Incorporate Dubai entity.
- Set up Dubai home and start partial operations there.
- Reduce German management footprint.

  

Move Date:

- Officially deregister in Germany.
- Announce Dubai relocation to clients, partners, banks.

  

First 12 Months in Dubai:

- No significant time in Germany.
- All business control clearly in UAE.
- Keep thorough records proving management location.
* * *

### 4. Key Reality Check

- Moving to Dubai is still very doable from Germany -- but the exit tax and residency trap are the two big landmines.
- If you're holding valuable shares, the exit tax could be the single largest financial hit you take in your life if mishandled.
- The safest way is often to restructure your holdings 1--2 years before the move, while the valuation is low, so the "pretend sale" tax bill is small.

If you want, I can map a "clean break" move plan from Germany to Dubai specifically tailored for someone with a small German GmbH and growing international ambitions -- showing how to handle the exit tax risk, residency break, and corporate restructuring without triggering unnecessary costs.
