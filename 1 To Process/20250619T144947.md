You should have asked: _"Define the minimal viable structure of Support Divisions, Strategic Operations, and the Strategic Council needed to operate and scale the organisation--naming exact units, their mandates, and the irreducible posts."_

* * *

## I. Strategic Core

### 1. **Strategic Council (SC)**

**Function**: Strategic oversight; defines vision, doctrine, capital allocation; does not execute.  
**Mandate**: Unitary. Must speak through formally ratified doctrine.

| Role | Description | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Chair** | First among equals; convenes and closes decisions | 
| **Vision** | Articulates enduring direction, narrative, frontier | 
| **People** | Sets cultural doctrine, FO doctrine, hiring standards | 
| **Strategy** | Owns campaigns, priority definition, capital flow | 
| **Finance** | Budgeting, funding decisions, treasury and investor comms | 
| **Risk & Integrity** | Legal, IP, regulatory compliance, code of conduct | 

_Total: 6 posts_

> They define _what must be true_. They do not enforce _how it gets done_. That is SO's mandate.

* * *

## II. Strategic Operations (SO)

**Function**: Translates vision into executable structure. Operational architecture + strategic planning.  
**Mandate**: Plan, initiate, support, and audit Missions. No ownership of execution results.

| Unit | Mandate | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Planning Cell** | Scenario design, campaign planning, timeline control | 
| **Doctrine Cell** | Owns the `doctrine` repo, process cards, taxonomy | 
| **Logistics Cell** | Supports tool selection, provisioning, access control | 
| **Liaison Cell** | Coordinates with Field Officers, monitors Missions | 
| **Intel Cell** | Monitors internal telemetry + external market signals | 

_Total: ~5 cells (2--3 individuals per cell)_

> SO is based on General Staff logic. It makes action legible and survivable--but doesn't do the work.

* * *

## III. Support Divisions (SD)

**Function**: Provide continuity, stability, and enablement. Operational sovereignty over scoped terrain.  
**Mandate**: Administer live systems; enact predefined policy. Cannot unilaterally invent doctrine.

### 1. **Infra & IT**

- GitHub/org access management
- R2/S3, DNS, CI/CD pipelines
- Onboarding/offboarding automation
- Workspace compliance

### 2. **Legal & Integrity**

- NDAs, MSAs, IP assignment
- Policy compliance
- Contract negotiation support

### 3. **Finance & Admin**

- Budgeting support, invoicing
- Bookkeeping, cap table
- Interface to fiscal/tax consultants

### 4. **People & Capability**

- Recruitment ops
- Learning pathways
- Wellbeing, offboarding, conflict mediation

_Each division requires 1--2 leads. Staff grows with scale._

* * *

## IV. Field Officers (FO)

**Function**: Operational bridge. Each Mission gets one.  
**Mandate**: Ensure momentum, remove friction, route comms, enforce doctrine in-flight.

- Reports up to SO Liaison Cell
- Embedded in Missions
- No P&L, no hiring authority, but has full access to SD interfaces

> Think of FO as your organisational _combat medics_--embedded, doctrine-bound, field-aware.

* * *

## V. Execution Units

Defined only for context; not part of the strategic core:

| Unit | Function | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Mission** | Executes on scoped objective, sprint-driven | 
| **Program** | Groups Projects under thematic focus | 
| **Campaign** | Aligns Programs under strategic ambition | 
| **Cell** | Tactical sub-units within Missions | 

Missions are transient. Programs and Campaigns live as long as their ambition persists.

* * *

## VI. Summary Table

| Org Layer | Unit/Title | # Posts | Function Summary | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Strategic Core | Strategic Council | 6 | Define direction, doctrine, mandate | 
| Operational Core | Strategic Operations | 5 cells | Translate strategy to executable architecture | 
| Stability Layer | Support Divisions | 4 divs | Enforce continuity, systems, legality | 
| Field Interface | Field Officers | 1 per Mission | Execution support, doctrine enforcement | 
| Execution Layer | Missions, Programs | dynamic | Project & work delivery | 

* * *

## Bottom Line

- Strategic Council defines **what is to be true**.
- Strategic Operations makes it **actionable**.
- Support Divisions make it **repeatable**.
- Field Officers make it **real**.
- Missions make it **done**.

No structure should exist without a function.  
No function without mandate.  
No mandate without structural containment.
