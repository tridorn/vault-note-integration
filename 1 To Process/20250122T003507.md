Beyond that I also want to add "profiles" (not an account), I envision profiles to be essentially fancy checklists for various cases, that are used through builders (that build the profiles, essentially collects the required items for the assembled profile). A profile could for example be: Businessman in his forties, that would include everything relevant to a person that matches this profile, such as leadership, work, retirement, also things like sports, just a general overview of everything relevant to that profile. You can essentially picture it like blank spots to various topics relevant to that topic that get filled with the best practices, that not only gives the person an overview of everything relevant, but also immediately addresses how to best handle it
