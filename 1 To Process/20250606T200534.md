**Clarification:** Your request should have been more precisely articulated as: _"Provide a structured overview of the distinct digital environments Eupator must establish, detailing their specific roles, boundaries, and interdependencies within the business's operational model."_
* * *

### STRUCTURED OVERVIEW: DIGITAL SPACES FOR EUPATOR

Your digital footprint must be segmented by function, not by platform vanity. Each space must serve a distinct strategic role with no duplication. Below is the categorisation by operational domain:

* * *

### 1. **Public-Facing Spaces (Credibility & Acquisition)**

These are designed to **signal competence**, **capture leads**, and **establish authority**. They must be minimal yet precise.

#### a. **Website (eupator.de)**

- **Purpose:** Digital audit offering → clear CTA → lead capture
- **Structure:**

    - Hero: Problem/Solution framing

    - Offer: Tiered audit products, deliverables, pricing (or "starting from")

    - Credibility: Case examples or anonymised results

    - CTA: Embedded Typeform or Calendly
- **Hosting Platform:** Framer or Carrd
- **Update Frequency:** Monthly or less

#### b. **LinkedIn Company Page**

- **Purpose:** Social proof for SMEs, build credibility through content
- **Content Type:**

    - Posts with audit insights (performance gains, UX issues, etc.)

    - Client testimonials

    - Growth benchmarks
- **Operational Role:** Trust amplifier, mild SEO, passive lead gen
- **Frequency:** Weekly post cadence

#### c. **Google Business Profile**

- **Purpose:** Local trust and discoverability
- **Focus:**

    - Address or service area (required)

    - Reviews

    - Services description
- **Update Frequency:** Static with occasional review management
* * *

### 2. **Internal Execution Spaces (Fulfillment & Coordination)**

These house **the operational brain** of the business. Must be tightly integrated and minimal.

#### a. **Notion (Central Operations Hub)**

- **Purpose:** Unified system for client tracking, delivery, SOPs
- **Structure:**

    - CRM board: status, client details, touchpoints

    - Project tracker: milestones per audit

    - Knowledge base: SOPs for audits, outreach, onboarding freelancers

    - Templates: Audit deliverable, briefing docs
- **Role:** Operational nucleus
- **Permissions:** Internal + selective freelancer access

#### b. **Google Drive**

- **Purpose:** File storage and delivery
- **Structure:**

    - Root: Clients

    - Subfolders: /intake /audit-report /assets /delivery
- **Use Case:** Client file exchange, report sharing
- **Integration:** Linked in Notion and via email

#### c. **Gmail + Loom**
- **Purpose:** Communication and delivery
- **Structure:**

    - Branded email (e.g. [jonas@eupator.de](mailto:jonas@eupator.de))

    - Templates: onboarding, delivery, upsell

    - Loom: Embedded in email for delivery walk-throughs
- **Operational Use:** Asynchronous clarity + client confidence
* * *

### 3. **Acquisition + Input Spaces (Lead Generation)**

Designed for controlled intake of new business.

#### a. **Typeform / Tally (Intake Form)**

- **Purpose:** Pre-qualification of leads
- **Structure:**

    - Company type

    - Digital assets (website, social, etc.)

    - Problem area (SEO, speed, UX, etc.)

    - Budget (optional)
- **Output:** Routed to Notion CRM

#### b. **Calendly (Optional)**

- **Purpose:** Schedule intro calls if needed
- **Use:** Reserved only for high-interest leads (avoid calendar bloat)

#### c. **Advertising (Future Layer)**

- **Channels:** Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads (when ROI-positive)
- **Purpose:** Amplify pipeline when audit capacity is stable
* * *

### 4. **Outsourcing + Fulfillment Interfaces**

These are not client-facing but critical for execution scale.

#### a. **Freelance Portals (Malt, Upwork, etc.)**

- **Purpose:** Talent sourcing per audit category (SEO, dev, etc.)
- **Workflow:**

    - Use Notion brief templates

    - Manage externally, deliver back into Drive

    - Pay via Wise/Revolut

#### b. **Contractor Knowledge Base (Notion)**

- **Purpose:** Train once, delegate many
- **Contents:** SOPs, audit checklists, report formats
* * *

### 5. **Data + Analytics Layer (Internal Intelligence)**

To measure impact and guide growth moves.

#### a. **Google Analytics + Search Console**
- **Purpose:** Website performance monitoring
- **Frequency:** Monthly review

    - Lead sources

    - Close rates

    - Project delivery times

#### c. **Time Tracking (Optional)**

- **Tool:** Toggl or Clockify

### Final Note

Do not conflate "presence" with "engagement". Eupator's digital architecture must remain lean, structured, and strategic. Visibility is earned through clarity and consistency, not content volume or multi-channel saturation.

If desired, I can generate the file/folder hierarchy and Notion board templates as JSON or prebuilt workspace. Confirm.
