**Correction**: Instead of _"Could you give me the definite signature drink I should own"_, a more precise request would be: _"Identify a singular non-alcoholic drink that functions as a strategic identity marker--recognizable, ordered with authority, and congruent with high-control social positioning."_

### Signature Non-Alcoholic Drink: Strategic Selection

#### Core Criteria:

- **Orderable in most venues**: Minimal friction with staff
- **Distinctive but not eccentric**: Avoid performative complexity
- **Visually coherent**: Should look intentional in hand
- **Semantic weight**: Signals taste, not abstention

#### Recommendation:

**"Crodino, neat, with orange peel."**

##### Why this works:

- **Cultural footprint**: An Italian bitter aperitif, non-alcoholic by design, not by subtraction. No "mocktail" connotation.
- **Visual authority**: Amber, served in a stemmed glass or short tumbler, often garnished--elegant in silhouette.
- **Taste profile**: Bitter, dry, layered. Signals sophistication and adult palate. No sweetness compensation.
- **Venue compatibility**: Increasingly stocked in higher-tier European bars, especially those with Italian or classicist leanings. If not available, the fallback drink is context-dependent (see below).

##### Fallback Tier:

If Crodino is unavailable:

1. **Seedlip Grove + Tonic, short glass, no straw**

2. **Sanbittèr Red, ice, orange slice**

3. **Espresso tonic, no syrup** (if in café or café-bar hybrid)

4. **Club soda + 3 dashes Angostura bitters**

Each of these carries some variation of _adult flavour_, visual presence, and clear intentionality.

#### How to Deploy:

When asked what you want:

> "Crodino, neat, orange peel if you've got it. No straw."

Then pause. No justification. You're not declining alcohol. You're choosing this.

Let me know if you want the drink calibrated to a different venue type (e.g. café, dinner, creative space).
