The first and strongest Crystalline, whom we'll call **Primus Crystallum**, would have a fighting style that not only demonstrates the pinnacle of Crystalline capabilities but also sets the standard for their entire combat system. Here's a holistic concept for Primus Crystallum's unique style:

**1. Mastery of Crystalline Form**:
   - **Perfect Form Control**: Primus can manipulate his crystalline form with unparalleled precision, morphing parts of his body into various weapons or shields instantaneously. His body can become as hard as diamond for defense or as sharp as a blade for offense.
   - **Size Alteration**: He possesses the unique ability to alter his size, becoming larger to intimidate and overpower foes or shrinking to increase agility and elusiveness in combat.

**2. Advanced Elemental Magic**:
   - **Elemental Synthesis**: Primus combines multiple elements simultaneously, a feat no other Crystalline can match. He might conjure a storm of fire and ice, or create a barrier of earth and air, for instance.
   - **Energy Absorption and Redirection**: He can absorb energy attacks and redirect them, or even convert absorbed energy into different forms, like turning a fireball into a blast of kinetic force.

**3. Supreme Telekinetic and Psychic Abilities**:
   - **Overwhelming Telekinesis**: Primus can manipulate entire battlefields, levitating large objects or multiple enemies, creating a dynamic and ever-changing combat environment.
   - **Psychic Overload**: His psychic abilities can overwhelm the minds of adversaries, rendering them incapacitated or turning them against each other.

**4. Unmatched Tactical Genius**:
   - **Predictive Combat**: With centuries of experience, Primus can predict and counter enemy strategies several moves ahead, almost as if reading the minds of his opponents.
   - **Strategic Terrain Manipulation**: He alters the terrain to his advantage, creating natural fortresses or traps, ensuring heâ€™s always in a position of strength.

**5. Illusion Mastery**:
   - **Realistic Illusions**: Primus's illusions are so realistic they can trick even the most experienced warriors, allowing him to mislead, confuse, and ambush his enemies.

**6. Enhanced Mobility and Speed**:
   - **Instantaneous Movement**: He moves so swiftly it appears as if he's teleporting, striking from multiple angles in rapid succession.

**7. Use of Ancient Magical Artifacts**:
   - **Artifacts of Legend**: Primus wields artifacts lost to history, each with unique powers. For example, a staff that controls time or a cloak that renders him invisible.

**8. Harmonic Battle Meditation**:
   - **Battlefield Harmony**: In group combat, Primus synchronizes his movements and attacks with his fellow Crystallines, enhancing their abilities and creating a harmonious flow of combat.

**9. Elemental and Magical Aura**:
   - **Aura Projection**: He projects an aura that can either bolster the abilities of allies or weaken enemies, depending on his focus.

**Combat Scenario**:
In battle, Primus is a whirlwind of crystalline fury and elemental power. He might start by assessing his opponents, using illusions to misdirect them. As they engage, he adapts his size and form, countering their attacks with his shape-shifting abilities. His movements are fluid and unpredictable, enhanced by his speed.

Simultaneously, he manipulates the battlefield, using telekinesis to turn the environment against his enemies, while casting elemental spells of immense power. If overwhelmed, he taps into his artifacts, manipulating time to outmaneuver foes or using his cloak for stealth attacks.

Primus's presence on the battlefield is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a testament to the might and sophistication of the Crystalline combat system.
