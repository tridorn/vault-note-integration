You should have said:  
**“I want the Company Architecture Protocol to be modular and layered—more like a strategic formula with checkboxes. It should be structured to support full scalability, standardization, replacement of parts, and forward-thinking systematization. Think in layers, not departments—something that builds from foundation to advanced layers like a stack.”**

You're asking for a **Layered Operating Architecture**: a structured framework that allows any organization to be *systematized, audited, scaled, or rebuilt* from zero—using modular, replaceable layers.

This is not a structure based on *what people do*, but on *what must be true for a company to function*. Let’s design that.

## **The Company Layer Stack (CLS)**  
> A modular, forward-operating system for building and managing any company as a set of replaceable, composable, scalable layers.

---

### **The 7 Layers of the Company Layer Stack**

Each layer:
- Is **independent**, but interfaces cleanly with the others  
- Can be **audited, templated, replaced, or scaled**  
- Exists whether you’re solo or 500 people  
- Is structured like a **checklist-driven setup system**

## **II. How It Scales**

You can:
- **Start at Layer 1** and work up (bootstrapping mode)  
- Or **audit an existing company** by assessing each layer’s completeness  
- Or **overlay this on a messy org** to diagnose gaps

Each layer can be:
- **Implemented in Notion / Obsidian / Google Drive**
- **Documented using the Map Protocol format**
- **Standardized and published** to your team or community

This means **Eupator can deploy this entire architecture like a launch kit.**

Would you like me to:
- Build this as a **Notion checklist system** (with templates for each artifact)?
- Create an **interactive audit sheet** (to assess any business against these 7 layers)?
- Format this as a **“Company Builder Kit” PDF** you can give to students/startups under Eupator?

Choose one. I’ll execute.
