Absolutely‚Äîputting together a fountain pen ink portfolio is a fantastic way to explore the spectrum of writing moods, use cases, and visual expression. A well-rounded selection gives you a reliable ink for every purpose (office, journaling, artistic, archival, fun) without overwhelming your pen case.

‚úíÔ∏è The Ideal 7-Ink Portfolio (Starter to Advanced)

Here‚Äôs a curated set of seven inks that cover all essential roles, mix visual pleasure with practicality, and introduce you to different ink behaviors (shading, sheen, waterproofness, etc.):

Slot	Ink Type	Recommendation	Why It‚Äôs Included
1. Daily Workhorse	Blue-Black	Diamine Oxford Blue or Sailor Sei-boku (waterproof)	Formal, versatile, and clean. Works on office paper and looks dignified.
2. Vibrant but Professional	Deep Teal or Burgundy	Robert Oster Deep Sea or Diamine Oxblood	Adds character without being loud. Excellent shading.
3. Waterproof/Archival	Pigment or Iron Gall	Rohrer & Klingner Salix (iron gall) or Platinum Carbon Black	Permanent and fade-resistant‚Äîideal for signatures, sketching, or journaling.
4. Shading Champion	Soft Blue or Olive	Pilot Iroshizuku Fuyu-syogun or Sailor Rikyu-cha	Gentle colours with stunning tonal range. Beautiful in medium/stub nibs.
5. Sheening Ink	Sheening Blue or Green	Diamine Majestic Blue or Vinta Aegean Armada	These inks shift colour depending on paper and light. A delight for letter writing.
6. Shimmer Ink	Sparkly but Functional	Diamine Arctic Blue (Shimmer) or Herbin Emerald of Chivor	Sparkle responsibly! Great for cards, headers, or sketching.
7. Wild Card / Mood Ink	Your Personal Favorite	Choose something you‚Äôre emotionally drawn to‚Äîmaybe a purple, burnt orange, or pink.	This is the ‚Äúyou‚Äù ink‚Äîtotally for fun or introspection. Maybe something like Ferris Wheel Press Tanzanite Sky or Troublemaker Milky Ocean.

üß† Tips for Building a Portfolio
	‚Ä¢	Start with 1-2 ‚Äúsafe‚Äù inks for regular use, and build around them with ‚Äúemotional‚Äù inks.
	‚Ä¢	Try samples (via retailers like Goulet, Cult Pens, or Yoseka) before committing to full bottles.
	‚Ä¢	Rotate seasonally. Rich browns in autumn, fresh greens in spring, icy greys in winter‚Äîit‚Äôs a thing!
	‚Ä¢	Consider how your pens behave with different inks (dry nibs may love wet inks like Robert Oster; wet pens may tame dryer inks like Rohrer & Klingner).
