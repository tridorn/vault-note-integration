Love the direction, Ben. Here's a crisp, no-nonsense take on the name "Dornhelm" and how to use it across your ecosystem.

  

# What "Dornhelm" signals (and risks)

- Pros

    - Classical & Germanic: short, pronounceable, strong consonants; reads "serious" in EU/US.

    - Ownable online: relatively rare surname; SEO can be clean (main clash is Austrian director Robert Dornhelm).
- Watch-outs

    - Semantic baggage: "Dorn" = thorn, "Helm" = helmet in German; can evoke martial imagery (think "steel helmet"/Stahlhelm). That's not fatal, just be mindful of visual identity and tone so it feels civic/future-positive, not militaristic.

    - Eponymy: if your public pen-name is Tristan Dornhelm and the movement is Dornhelm, outsiders may read it as "centered on a person," which you said you want to avoid.

  

# Three brand-architecture options (rationally ranked)

  

1) Dual-brand (recommended).

- Apex/control: Dornhelm Stewardship (foundation/purpose vehicle) + possibly Dornhelm Institute as the research shell.
- Public movement (front-door brand): a non-eponymous name (e.g., Frontier Commons, Apogee Assembly, Orbital Commons, Civic Frontier).
- Your pen-name: Tristan Dornhelm as the lead author/host.

Why: keeps your voice at the apex, but the movement feels bigger than any one person; easier coalition-building and succession.

  

2) Masterbrand "Dornhelm" everywhere.

- Dornhelm Institute, Dornhelm Congress, Dornhelm Review.

Why/why not: tight coherence, strong equity; but high founder association and the martial semantical shade means you'll need softer design cues and careful narrative.

  

3) Fully non-eponymous.

- Movement + institute use a neutral name; "Dornhelm" only as your author name.

Why/why not: maximal independence from the person; slower equity transfer from your personal brand.

  

# Practical guardrails if you keep "Dornhelm" visible

- Design language: avoid crests, eagles, spiked helmets, gothic type. Use humanist sans, light palette, orbital/commons imagery to counter any martial read.
- Tagline framing: "standards, stewardship, frontier commons" (civil not combative).
- Disclosure: where law requires (EU/Germany lobbying registers, grants), use your legal name (Ben Jendyk) and disclose the pen name; pseudonyms are fine publicly, but registries expect real identities.

  

# Legal/trademark due-diligence (minimum)

1. Clearance search for "Dornhelm" in EUIPO classes you'll use (research/education, publications, events, consulting, software/standards).

2. Domain & handle sweep: dornhelm.org / .institute / .foundation + social handles.

3. Trademark filing for either the public movement name (if non-eponymous) or "Dornhelm Institute" if you go masterbrand.

  

# Simple naming tests (run these this week)

- The radio test: can people spell it after hearing it once? (Dornhelm scores OK in DE/EN.)
- The "coalition" test: would universities/space agencies/NGOs comfortably co-logo with it? (If hesitation, prefer the dual-brand route.)
- The future-proof test: does it still work if you step back from the spotlight? (Dual-brand wins.)

  

# My recommendation (one-liner)

  

Use Dornhelm at the apex (control & authorship), but give the public movement a neutral, civic name that invites broad participation. That preserves your personal lever while preventing "personality cult" optics and sidestepping any accidental militaristic read.

  

If you want, I can propose 10 strong non-eponymous movement names (screened for tone, .org availability patterns, and EUIPO conflicts) and a micro brand kit that visually de-risks "Dornhelm."
