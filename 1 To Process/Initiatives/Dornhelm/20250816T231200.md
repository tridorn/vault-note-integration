Got it -- you're at the very beginning. You're standing up the business side (HoldCo/studio) now, but you don't want the civilisational lab / platform to lag too far behind. The trap would be trying to launch both at "full scale" immediately. Let's rationally break down how to begin the lab without overbuilding or compromising your business focus.
* * *

# 1. Think of the Lab as "content + convening" first, not a big institution
- Don't set up a large formal institute right away (too much overhead, legal complexity, risk of "empty shell").
- Instead: start with a lightweight platform that publishes ideas, builds credibility, and convenes a community.
- Over time, you grow into formal structures (gGmbH, e.V., Foundation) once you have traction and need for funding partnerships.
* * *

# 2. The Minimum Viable Lab (Year 0--2)

  

What it actually looks like:

  

Outputs

- A regular essay/paper cadence under a consistent brand (your "civilisational" platform).
- A quarterly foresight brief (e.g. Space-Age Governance Letter).
- A public registry of principles (your draft "Constitution" -- even if only 2 pages at first).
- A public event once or twice a year (roundtable or small symposium, streamed online).

  

Inputs

- Your own time + 1 part-time researcher/assistant (can be freelance/contractor).
- Shared services from your HoldCo (design, finance, hosting, comms).
- A handful of advisors/friends (build an "advisory circle" instead of a board yet).

  

Entity form (for now)

- Start lean: use your business HoldCo to host the Lab as a branded initiative.

    - No new legal entity at the very start.

    - This avoids parallel overhead and lets you test resonance.
- Later, when you need to accept grants, donations, memberships, spin it out into a gGmbH (research/education) + optionally an e.V. (advocacy).
* * *

# 3. Key practices to establish from day one

- Editorial integrity: publish under a separate brand (not "Yourname GmbH"), even if legally it sits inside HoldCo at first. This builds trust that the platform is bigger than you.
- Transparency: note clearly that this is "an initiative incubated by [HoldCo], with the intention to evolve into a public-interest institute."
- Cadence discipline: better to publish one 2,000-word paper every quarter consistently than 5 blog posts randomly. Consistency builds credibility.
- Advisory circle: recruit 3--5 respected thinkers (academia, ex-regulators, industry) to co-sign or contribute early pieces. Gives you instant legitimacy and reduces perception of it being "just a personal blog."
- Community kernel: use events (even small digital salons) to start convening your future movement.
* * *

# 4. Resource balance with your business

- Budget: start with 5--10% of your own time + â‚¬50--100k/year max (assistant + publishing + events).
- Talent: contract freelance researchers/designers rather than hiring staff.
- Cross-leverage: use the shared services of HoldCo (design, finance, ops) so you don't duplicate infra.
- Governance: you alone as editor/publisher until there's enough traction to warrant a separate board.
* * *

# 5. Triggers for formalizing into an entity

  

You incorporate a Lab entity (gGmbH/e.V./Foundation) only when:

1. You want to apply for public funding (e.g. Horizon Europe, DAAD, national science funds).

2. You want to accept external donations or memberships.

3. You need a clear firewall between policy outputs and commercial ventures (for trust).

  

Until then, run it as a branded initiative incubated by HoldCo.

# 6. Roadmap snapshot

- Year 0--1: Incubation phase.

    - Launch brand & manifesto.

    - Publish quarterly briefs.

    - Convene 1--2 public roundtables.
- Year 2--3: Legitimization phase.

    - Form gGmbH (research/education).

    - Apply for 1--2 grants.

    - Launch fellowship or challenge prize.
- Year 4--5: Institutionalization phase.

    - Spin advocacy arm if needed (e.V.).

    - Build staff of 5--10.

    - Publish flagship "State of the Space-Age" annual report.

    - Institute recognized in policy circles; movement/community scales.
* * *

# 7. Rational summary

- Don't build a heavy "Institute" upfront -- start light, as a publishing + convening platform incubated inside HoldCo.
- Anchor it in consistent outputs, transparency, and advisory legitimacy.
- Spin out formal nonprofit entities only when needed (funding, independence, advocacy).
- Treat the Lab as your apex voice and HoldCo as your engine of execution, both linked in one ecosystem.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to draft a concrete "First-Year Lab Playbook" (with month-by-month steps: publish cadence, first event, brand launch, who to invite for advisory circle, budget sketch)? That could give you a very actionable starting map.
