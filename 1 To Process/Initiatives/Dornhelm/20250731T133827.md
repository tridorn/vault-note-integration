**Correction.** More precisely framed: _"Given that I must create personal accounts (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn, X) to access essential functionality, how should these be configured to support operational needs without undermining the institutional primacy of Dornhelm?"_
* * *

### 1 Core Distinction: _Access Identity_ vs _Public Identity_

You're not creating "personal accounts" in the expressive sense; you're generating **access identities**--infrastructure-level keys necessary to control institutional interfaces. The persona of _Tristan Dornhelm_ remains functionally private, operationally sovereign, and strategically silent.

* * *

### 2 General Rules for All Personal Accounts

| Constraint | Implementation | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Zero visibility** | Set profiles to private or minimal public footprint. No bios, no links, no profile pictures. Use grayscale avatars if required. | 
| **No content** | Never post, comment, like, follow, or star. You're not present; you are a key. | 
| **Alias consistency** | Use `tdornhelm`, `tristan-d`, or variants of `tristandornhelm` across all platforms for coherence. | 
| **Institutional linking** | If required to state affiliation, always write: "Operator of Dornhelm" or "Steward of the Dornhelm Institute." Do not claim founder status explicitly. | 
| **No network graph exposure** | Never connect with others unless technically required. Turn off visibility of connections and follows. | 
* * *

### 3 Platform-Specific Implementation

#### **GitHub (Personal Account)**

- Username: `tristandornhelm` or `tdornhelm`.
- Bio: None or "Maintainer of Dornhelm Org."
- Public repos: None, unless protocol requires signature from personal account (then mirror from org).
- Use to control `dornhelm` GitHub organization. Push via org account.

#### **LinkedIn (Personal Stub)**

- Name: Tristan Dornhelm
- Title: "Operator at Dornhelm Institute"
- Connections: Zero or minimal. Disable who can see your connections.
- Activity: None. No endorsements, posts, likes, or comments.
- Sole purpose: Legitimation anchor for `Dornhelm Institute` page.

#### **X / Twitter (Personal Account)**

- Account exists for platform access only (e.g. managing `@Dornhelm`).
- Handle: `@tdornhelm`; protected account, zero tweets, zero follows.
- Do not follow anyone. Never like or repost.

#### **Email**

- Create `tristan@dornhelm.com` to control downstream accounts.
- Do not use Gmail or similar for any infrastructure-critical asset.
- All auto-forwarded to your real admin channel.

### 4 Operational Layering

| Layer | Interface | Role of Personal Account | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Public Presence** | `@Dornhelm`, `dornhelm.com`, institutional GitHub org, etc. | Not mentioned. Not visible. Not credited. | 
| **Administrative Control** | Platform backends, analytics dashboards, email clients. | Personal account used to hold root access. MFA enforced. | 
| **Content Authorship** | Essays, PDFs, whitepapers. | Signed "by Dornhelm." Metadata tied to project; no personal attribution. | 
| **Legal/Financial Ops** | Bank, Stripe, Notion, incorporation documents. | Use legal identity of Dornhelm as an entity. You sign as "Operator." | 
* * *

### 5 Long-Term Governance

If Dornhelm matures into a staffed institute or policy operator:

- Personal accounts become ghost infrastructure.
- Transfer control to institutional roles (`admin@dornhelm.com`, etc.).
- Destroy all public trace of personal identities unless legally required.
- Transition authorship to multi-editor "Dornhelm Board" for resilience.
* * *

### Final Assessment

You need personal accounts. Treat them not as expressions but as **private operator keys**. Never confuse platform presence with platform control. The system sees _Tristan Dornhelm_ only as the access layer behind _Dornhelm_--which remains the sole public intelligence actor. Keep it that way.
