### 0 — Strategic Premise  

A **UG (haftungs­beschränkt)** is a *mini-GmbH* governed by the GmbH-Gesetz with two special quirks:  
1. paid-in capital may start at **€1** (§ 5a I GmbHG) citeturn3search0;  
2. 25 % of each year’s net profit must be locked in a statutory reserve until € 25 000 is amassed (§ 5a III) citeturn6search2.  

Treat the entity as a *prototype shell*: cheap to seed, simple to pivot, easy to move once you expatriate. The discipline you impose now—share ledger, minutes, statutory filings—becomes the evidentiary spine that will save you in an exit-tax audit later.

## 1 — Articles of Association (Satzung): Six Clauses You Cannot Fumble  

| Clause | Essential content | Why it matters later |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **§ 1 Firma & Sitz** | Company name + registered office (choose low Gewerbesteuer town). | Seat clause must be migratable under the EU Mobility Directive. |
| **§ 2 Unternehmens­gegenstand** | Broad but intelligible object (“Entwicklung und Vertrieb digitaler Produkte; Halten von Beteiligungen”). | Avoid a too-narrow object that blocks future pivots. |
| **§ 3 Stammkapital & Geschäfts­anteile** | State initial capital (e.g. € 5 000) and split into **one share** unless you add a holding later. | Single share keeps the future valuation file simple. |
| **§ 4 Geschäftsführung & Vertretung** | List managing directors (Geschäftsführer) and representation rule (einzeln vs. gemeinsam). | Investors will insist on dual signatory; start with single now. |
| **§ 5 Gesellschafter­beschlüsse** | All resolutions by simple majority *except* → seat transfer & capital measures demand 75 %. | Gives you a super-majority shield but keeps flexibility. |
| **§ 6 Umwandlung & Sitzverlegung** | Explicit power to convert to GmbH *or* relocate seat to any EEA state with 75 % vote. | Speeds up cross-border conversion in 2028. |

> **Drafting tip**: skip the *Musterprotokoll*; invest € 1 500 in a bespoke Satzung. The boiler-plate template bans share classes and future silent partners—fatal if you raise capital.

## 2 — Founding Mechanics (Weeks 0–6)  

1. **Name clearance** via local IHK.  
2. **Notary meeting**: sign the Satzung; instruct notary to file for Handelsregister B.  
3. **Capital deposit** into an *Anderkonto* (escrow) opened by the notary; release proof to court.  
4. Court registers the UG → you receive **HRB-number** ≈ 7–14 days.  
5. **Trade registration** (Gewerbeanmeldung) at municipality.  
6. **Tax questionnaire** (Fragebogen zur steuerlichen Erfassung) to Finanzamt → receive **Steuernummer** (CIT + VAT) in 2–4 weeks.

## 3 — Operating Playbook: Governance & Minutes  

### 3.1 Corporate Calendar  

| When | Mandatory act | Content pointers |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **Within 3 months of foundation** | Opening balance sheet | Prepared under German GAAP (GoB). |
| **Quarterly** | **Board meeting** (Geschäftsführer) | KPI review, risk register, valuation memo, reserve calculation. |
| **Annually (within first 8 months of following FY)** | Shareholders’ meeting | Approve financials, profit appropriation (25 % reserve), discharge of management, strategic resolutions. |
| **By 12 months after FY-end** | File Jahresabschluss with *Bundesanzeiger* | Micro-UG can file abridged balance sheet (§ 267a HGB). |

### 3.2 Minute-crafting protocol  

1. **Header**: company, date, time, location, attendees (physical or video).  
2. **Agenda**, circulated at least 3 days in advance (unless 100 % waiver).  
3. **Discussion log**: concise—but record *rationale* for material decisions (valuations, IP licence terms).  
4. **Resolutions**: exact wording, votes for/against, reference to statutory quorum.  
5. **Signature block**: chair + minute taker sign original; scan PDF to encrypted cloud; store original in corporate book.  

*Why the fuss?* The Finanzamt, BaFin, or courts will pierce sloppy corporate records in seconds. Exhaustive minutes are **cheap audit insurance**.

## 4 — Financial Operations Cheat-Sheet  

| Item | Rule of thumb | Statutory hook |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Shareholder loans** | Document contract; ≥ 2 % p.a. interest; board resolution approving. | Avoid hidden dividend (*vGA*) re-classification. |
| **Dividends** | Only out of distributable profit; 25 % must first feed the reserve until € 25 000; withhold 26.375 % Kapital­ertragsteuer (KapESt) when paying to you. | § 5a III GmbHG reserve; KapSt‐Abzugspflicht. |
| **Management salary** | Market-conform; board resolution; payroll taxes monthly. | Excess triggers *vGA* exposure. |
| **VAT filings** | Usually monthly for first two years; switch to quarterly once threshold met. | § 18 UStG. |
| **Corporate-income & trade tax** | Vorauszahlungen quarterly; rates depend on registered office. | CIT 15 % + SolZ; Gewerbesteuer ~10–17 %. |

## 5 — Common First-Timer Pitfalls ⛔ and Antidotes  

| Mistake | Consequence | Remedy |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Paying personal expenses from UG account | *vGA* → nondeductible + KapESt back-charge | Two bank cards: business only and personal only. |
| Ignoring the 25 % reserve rule | Personal liability of Geschäftsführer; dividend claw-back | Automate booking: 25 % of annual profit into *Gewinnrücklage*. |
| No *Fremdvergleich* for licence fees | TP adjustment; surcharge under § 162 AO | Cap royalty at 6 % revenue, document benchmarking. |
| Late Bundesanzeiger filing | € 2 500 fine + public warning | Calendar reminder 10 months after FY-end. |
| Over-optimistic valuation in board minutes | Larger exit-tax base later | Use conservative DCF with small-biz multiples (≤ 6× EBIT). |

## 6 — Upgrade & Migration Trigger Map  

| Threshold reached | Immediate action |
|-------------------|------------------|
| **Reserve = € 25 000** | Pass resolution: convert UG → GmbH, increase share capital, unlock brand value. |
| **Retained earnings ≥ € 200 000** | Incorporate **Holding-UG**; transfer OpCo share(s) at book value. |
| **Foreign residency ≤ 12 months away** | Draft *Umwandlungsplan* for cross-border seat move; engage notary early. |
| **Risk-on business line** (crypto, prop trading) | House it in a separate UG subsidiary; insulate core OpCo balance sheet. |

### Executive Bottom Line  

Your immediate objective is **procedural perfection, not fiscal acrobatics**. A meticulously run UG:

1. **Protects** you from German veil-piercing and exit-tax excesses;  
2. **Signals** credibility to Swiss private banks and future investors;  
3. **Transforms** effortlessly into a GmbH, a holding stack, or a migratable vehicle when you finally cross the border.

Follow the calendar, lock the minutes, respect the reserve, and every future structural evolution becomes a notarial formality—not a legal firefight.
