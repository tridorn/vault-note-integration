You're asking the right hard question.

If your true aim is influence/power-shaping, then a radical-transparency manifesto (like the draft "Transparency" page) can indeed corner you later -- because you've pledged away certain levers you may want to use.

  

Let's rationally untangle this:

* * *

# 1. Policy influence ≠ lobbying ≠ backroom power

- Classical lobbying → registered interest groups, lobbying registers, formal meetings with policymakers. Transparent by law in EU/DE/US. Narrow, regulated.
- Policy entrepreneurship → publishing white papers, convening conferences, producing "shovel-ready" models. Semi-public, thought-leader style.
- Power brokering / strategic influence → coalition building, private briefings, introductions, narrative-setting. Back-channel, often invisible, sometimes called "agenda-setting."

  

Your instinct is the third lane: less lobbying, more shaping the arena in which decisions are made. That's often far more effective.

* * *

# 2. The disclosure dilemma

- If you over-promise transparency → you tie your own hands, risk accusations of hypocrisy later.
- If you under-disclose → you look shadowy, lose legitimacy with intellectuals, media, public sector.
- If you're too blunt about "power brokering" → you invite scrutiny before you have enough real leverage.

  

Rational position:

You need layered disclosure. Public enough to earn legitimacy; private enough to keep manoeuvring space.

* * *

# 3. Structures that give you both legitimacy & flexibility

- Front stage (visible) → "Dornhelm Institute / Journal / Forum"

    - Outputs: essays, foresight reports, open conferences.

    - This establishes you as serious, civilisational, not ideological.

    - Here you emphasise independence, foresight, research.
- Back stage (quiet) → "Dornhelm Council / Strategy Circle" (invite-only)

    - Small convenings of policymakers, business leaders, technologists.

    - Agendas and membership not necessarily public; Chatham House rules.

    - This is where actual power-brokering happens.
- Firewall: keep the "Institute" and "Council" separate in function, even if they share brand. That way you can honestly say:

    - "The Institute is about research and public dialogue."

    - "The Council is a private, high-level strategy forum."

Both are true -- but you're not pledging away your ability to do backroom work.

# 4. Messaging: what you

# should

#  say vs. what you keep unsaid

- Public messaging (safe):

    - "Dornhelm advances long-term policy ideas and convenes diverse stakeholders."

    - "We bring together science, industry, and government to discuss civilisation-scale challenges."

    - "Our mission is foresight, dialogue, and standards."
- What you keep internal:

    - That you intend to steer coalitions toward specific outcomes.

    - That you'll broker relationships, not just ideas.

    - That you'll quietly build a network of dependency: your ventures supply capabilities that your policy wing promotes as "standards."

# 5. How to avoid "biting later"

1. Don't over-promise transparency.

    - Instead of a "Transparency" page with absolute vows, use Principles of Integrity: "We strive for openness where possible; where confidentiality is needed, we follow ethical standards."

2. Frame power brokering as convening.

    - Private dinners → "leadership roundtables."

    - Coalition building → "multi-stakeholder dialogues."

    - Narrative-shaping → "frameworks for decision-makers."

3. Protect yourself legally and reputationally.

    - If incorporated as a nonprofit, stay within its legal bounds (Germany's Gemeinnützigkeit excludes overt political campaigning; you'd run "advocacy" through a separate entity).

    - Sensitive influence work may sit under a for-profit advisory arm (consulting, strategy forum), not the nonprofit.
* * *

# 6. Rational recommended stance

- Brand: Dornhelm = intellectual + civilisational foresight.
- Institute (public): research, essays, events. Gives you credibility and cover.
- Council (private): invite-only, discreet, power-broker node. No promises of disclosure here.
- Messaging: emphasize foresight and convening. Never deny that you do closed-door work -- simply frame it as "forums for candid dialogue among leaders."
- Your persona (Tristan Dornhelm): seen as intellectual editor, not lobbyist. You float principles and frameworks. The deals get done in Council rooms.

  

This way, you:

- Retain legitimacy in public (no accusations of being a shadowy lobbyist front).
- Retain freedom to actually broker power.
- Keep optionality if later you need to go full "Institute" to access grants or recognition.
* * *

✅ Bottom line: Don't box yourself in with a transparency doctrine you can't uphold. Instead, build a dual structure:

- Public Institute (ideas, publications, forums).
- Private Council (invite-only, influence, deal-making).

Frame both as legitimate parts of "multi-layered convening." That keeps you honest, flexible, and credible.

Would you like me to draft a dual-entity blueprint (Institute vs. Council: names, functions, funding, legal wrappers, messaging) so you can see exactly how to stand them up without tripping over legal or reputational wires?
