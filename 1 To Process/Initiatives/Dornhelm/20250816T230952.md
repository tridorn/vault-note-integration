Love this. You want a single, living ecosystem where your space-age policy platform sits at the apex of your influence chain and interlocks with your business engine--without a hard split. Here's a clean, rational design that does exactly that.

- Purpose/Stewardship vehicle (apex): locks mission + voting control long-term (think: foundation/purpose trust). This keeps your civilizational vision central while allowing the business side to professionalize. Models like ZEISS/SCHOTT (owned by the Carl Zeiss Foundation) and Bosch (majority held by the Robert Bosch Stiftung) show how foundation control can anchor purpose while companies operate commercially.
- Civilisational Lab (your platform): your public voice + movement + research/education + media.
- Parent HoldCo: your compounder/studio that builds and acquires real businesses.
- Shared services: one "platform ops" serving both policy and business arms (finance/legal/talent/data), with firewalls where needed.
* * *

## What exactly is the "Civilisational Lab"?

  

Think of it as Institute + Media + Advocacy, with clear lanes:

1. Policy Institute (research/education + media platform)

    - Outputs: foresight reports, standards proposals, model laws, open datasets, simulation tools, a journal/podcast, conferences.

    - Space-age focus: space traffic management (STM), debris mitigation protocols, on-orbit servicing standards, ISRU/resource frameworks, dual-use governance, Earth--orbit industrial policy, safety/ethics at the AI×space nexus. (EU has already articulated an STM program--great anchor for your work.)

    - Funding: grants (e.g., Horizon Europe Space), memberships, courses, events.

2. Advocacy Network (movement)

    - Translates institute outputs into campaigns, coalitions, consultations, and citizen assemblies.

    - Legal note (Germany/EU): if you want tax-privileged status for research/education (e.g., a gGmbH or foundation), be careful: tax-exempt nonprofits have limits on political campaigning; the 2019 Attac case is the cautionary tale. Solution: dual-entity approach--policy research/education in a charitable vehicle; overt advocacy in a sister association that isn't tax-privileged. (This is common and still feels integrated to the public.)

  

### Suggested legal wrappers (Germany-friendly sketch; confirm with counsel)

- Institute / Media: gGmbH (charitable GmbH) focused on research/education & public interest comms. (Charitable status is a tax concept with specific "Gemeinnützigkeit" purposes.)
- Advocacy Network: separate eingetragener Verein (e.V.) for campaigns/lobbying; can be tax-privileged only if activities fit the rules--otherwise, keep it non-privileged to act freely.
- Stewardship/Control: a foundation or purpose-trust holds voting control in Parent HoldCo and the Institute (Patagonia's "purpose trust" is a modern example; in the DACH context, "steward-ownership" frameworks exist).

  

> This gives you one brand and shared mission, while the right activities occur in the right legal box. To the outside world it feels like one ecosystem.

## How the two halves reinforce each other (no hard bifurcation)

- Ideas → Standards → Pilots → Ventures loop

    1. Institute publishes a space-debris mitigation standard & economic model.

    2. Advocacy Network organizes a coalition and secures a regulator sandbox or EU call.

    3. HoldCo spins up or acquires a venture to build the enabling tech/service.

    4. Ventures feed data back to the Institute; the standard iterates; adoption grows.

- Conflict-of-interest sunlight

    - Maintain a public registry of interests: which subsidiaries could benefit from which policies.

    - Editorial independence charter for the Institute; disclose funding sources and board overlaps.

    - Shared services operate under SLAs; advocacy decisions are documented separately.

    - (This is how you keep trust while running an integrated system.)
* * *

## Governance & control

- Apex "Constitution" (your personal framework): 8--12 first-principles for a space-age civilisation (e.g., openness, safety, intergenerational stewardship, frontier environmentalism, antifragility, pluralism, dignity, rule-of-law in off-world domains). This document lives above everything and informs both policy positions and investment screens.
- Stewardship control

    - Purpose/Foundation vehicle holds super-voting or a golden share in Parent HoldCo + Institute to lock mission, while day-to-day is delegated to professional boards.

    - Proven German examples of foundation-anchored companies (ZEISS/SCHOTT; Bosch) show this can combine independence + long-termism.
- Boards & committees

    - HoldCo Board (operators + independents) → capital allocation.

    - Institute Board (academics, ex-regulators, industry) → editorial/standards independence.

    - Ethics/Risk Council across both → AI/space safety, lobbying transparency.
* * *

## Brand architecture (movement > individual, but your voice is the apex)

- Master brand = the movement/idea (not your surname).
- You are the founding voice and "chief steward." Your essays/pod/papers sit in the Institute's journal and set the tone, but the brand survives beyond any one person.
- Sub-brands for: Journal, Annual Congress, Challenge Prizes, Fellowship.
* * *

## Money flows (simple and clean)

- Institute (gGmbH): grants (Horizon Europe Space), memberships, events, courses, sponsorships with strict disclosure.
- Advocacy e.V.: member dues + donations (non-privileged if you want full campaigning freedom).
- HoldCo: cash from subsidiaries (dividends/secondaries) funds pilots, challenge prizes, and co-development with Institute (via clear contracts).
* * *

## First 12 months (practical)

1. Write the Constitution (your space-age principles) and publish a "Space Governance Blueprint 1.0."

2. Form the entities: Foundation/purpose vehicle; Institute gGmbH; Advocacy e.V.; Parent HoldCo. (Keep names and brand unified; let legal names vary.)

3. Advisory galaxy: ex-ESA/EC officials, orbital debris scientists, export-control counsel, industrial operators, foresight scholars.

4. Publish → convene → build:

    - Two flagship papers (e.g., "EU Space Traffic Management: A Private-Sector Implementation Playbook" + "On-Orbit Servicing Safety Standard").

    - Host an Annual Congress + launch a Prize for verification tech (debris detection, rendezvous risk scoring).

    - Spin 1--2 pilots with HoldCo; seek a Horizon Europe consortium slot.

5. Trust architecture: publish your Transparency Registry, editorial policy, and COI rules on day one.

6. Media engine: weekly essay + podcast; quarterly "State of the Space-Age" report.
* * *

## Risks & mitigations

- Regulatory/tax risk (nonprofit status): Germany's rules limit overt political campaigning for tax-privileged entities; separate research/education from advocacy, and document activities. (Attac ruling context.)
- Perception of self-dealing: pre-commit to disclosures, independent review, and bright-line recusal when your ventures could benefit from a policy you're pushing.
- Mission drift: lock voting control at the apex; cap donor concentration; no pay-for-policy.
* * *

## Why this works for

## your

##  goals

- Your platform stays at the apex (via stewardship control + master brand), but it feeds and is fed by real ventures.
- You avoid a brittle "two worlds" split; instead, you get a single ecosystem with the right legal lanes.
- You're positioned for the space age with legitimacy (policy rigor), community (movement), and execution (ventures).

  

If you'd like, I can draft (1) a 1-page Constitution outline, and (2) an entity chart with example ownership/control you can hand straight to counsel.
