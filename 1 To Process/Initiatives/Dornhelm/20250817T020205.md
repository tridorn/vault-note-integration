Awesome. Here's a tight, rational guide to the domains, website structure, and digital stack for launching Dornhelm (Institute + Council) alongside your business HoldCo--lean now, scalable later.

  

# 1) Domains & naming (reserve once, use gradually)

  

Primary org: dornhelm.org (civilisational/public vibe)

Defensive / future use: dornhelm.com, dornhelm.eu, dornhelm.de, dornhelm.institute

Persona/handle (optional): tridor.me or tristandornhelm.com (redirect to /about)

Email-only catch: dornhelm.net (optional)

  

Subdomains (map to programs, not legal entities):

- www.dornhelm.org -- main site (canonical)
- journal.dornhelm.org -- essays & briefs
- forum.dornhelm.org -- public events/congress
- standards.dornhelm.org -- drafts, specs, datasets
- fellows.dornhelm.org -- fellowship, applications (later)
- council.dornhelm.org -- invite-only portal (behind auth)
- media.dornhelm.org -- press kit & logos
- api.dornhelm.org -- future data endpoints/feeds

  

HoldCo: keep separate name + domain (neutral, non-political). Example pattern: aurora-holdings.com (placeholder). Cross-link lightly ("Dornhelm is incubated by…").

  

# 2) Information architecture (ship minimal now, extend later)

  

Phase 1 (lean launch)

- Home (mission + latest essay)
- Journal (essays)
- Briefs (quarterly, PDF + HTML)
- Forum (one upcoming, one past event)
- About (who/why; pen-name disclosure in one line)
- Contact (press@, info@)
- Newsletter (email capture)
- Legal: Impressum (Germany), Privacy, Terms, Cookies

  

Phase 2 (6--12 months)

- Standards (drafts, RFC-style comments)
- Library (all publications, filterable; RSS)
- Fellows (call + profiles)
- Observatory (metrics tracker--start simple)
- Council (login page + how invitations work)
- Transparency (principled but general wording)

  

URL rules

- English default; add German at /de/... later (hreflang).
- Slugs: /journal/orbital-commons-governance/
- Permanent links for PDFs; never change URLs; add canonical tags.

  

# 3) Content model (repeatable and unmistakably "Dornhelm")

- Journal → signed essays (Tristan Dornhelm byline); 1×/month cadence.
- Briefs → 3--5 per year; executive summary + 10--20 pages; embed system maps.
- Forum → 1 public event per year; publish agendas, not transcripts.
- Standards → numbered drafts (DH-STD-0001), each with scope, definitions, compliance notes.
- Observatory → one simple index to start (e.g., "Orbital Debris Coordination Readiness").

  

Use consistent front-matter (title, abstract, authors, funding/COI note, version).

  

# 4) Brand & editorial

- Masterbrand: Dornhelm; sub-labels: Journal, Briefs, Forum, Standards, Council.
- Persona: byline "Tristan Dornhelm (pen name of Ben Jendyk)"--disclosed once on /about & masthead footer; not on every page.
- Tone: civilisational, non-ideological, standards-oriented.
- Visuals: typographic wordmark, ample whitespace, astronomy/engineering motifs (abstract, not militaristic).

  

# 5) Stack options (pick one now; you can upgrade later)

  

A) Code-light, fast to ship (recommended to start)

- Site/CMS: Ghost(Pro) or Webflow
- Newsletter: Ghost native or Buttondown
- Hosting/CDN: Platform-native + Cloudflare in front
- Auth (Council): Memberstack/Outseta (simple gated pages)
- Search: Webflow native or Pagefind

  

B) Code-first, durable (if you have dev help)

- Site: Astro or Next.js + Markdown/MDX
- Headless CMS: Sanity/Contentful/Keystatic
- Hosting/CDN: Vercel or Netlify + Cloudflare
- Search: Typesense or Algolia DocSearch
- Auth (Council): Clerk/Auth0; gated routes
- Docs/Standards: Docusaurus section under standards.

  

Either way, keep it static-first for speed, security, and low cost.

  

# 6) Email & comms hygiene (EU-grade)

- Mail provider: Proton or Fastmail (custom domain)
- Set SPF, DKIM, DMARC (policy p=quarantine → p=reject in 30 days), aligned From: domain
- Mailboxes/aliases: press@, info@, journal@, forum@, council@
- Consider BIMI later (brand logo in inboxes)
- Sensitive Council invites: add a one-liner Chatham House Rule + watermarked PDFs

  

# 7) Privacy, legal & compliance (Germany/EU)

- Impressum (mandatory in DE) with responsible editor (§ 18 MStV)
- Datenschutzerklärung (GDPR), vendor list (processors), DPA copies on request
- Cookie policy; avoid third-party trackers → use Plausible or Matomo (EU host) to skip consent banners or keep them minimal
- security.txt at /.well-known/security.txt with a security contact
- Clear terms for Council (off-the-record policy, code of conduct, no-lobbying wording if you choose; or "stakeholder engagement" phrasing)

  

# 8) Performance & accessibility (bake in from day one)

- Target Core Web Vitals green: static pages, image optimization (WebP/AVIF), lazy loading
- WCAG 2.2 AA: keyboard nav, alt text, color contrast, focus states
- Structured data: Organization, Article/Report, Event; RSS + sitemap.xml; robots.txt
- Social: Open Graph + Twitter cards; auto OG images per post (e.g., Vercel OG)

  

# 9) Security & ops

- SSO + 2FA everywhere; hardware keys (FIDO2) for admin accounts
- Role-based access, least privilege; separate staging vs prod
- Cloudflare: DNS, proxy, WAF, bot fight mode, rate limiting
- Backups: 3-2-1 rule; repo + database snapshots
- Incident plan: dedicated security contact, templated disclosure email

  

# 10) Council (semi-private) mechanics

- council.dornhelm.org behind login; show public "What is Council?" page without member list
- Invite flows: personal .ics + unique RSVP link; no attendee list on the web
- Post-event: outcomes = workstreams (one-page charters), not minutes
- CRM for relationships & consent: EU-hosted (e.g., Folk, Pipedrive EU, or HubSpot EU with DPA); track lawful basis (GDPR)

  

# 11) SEO & distribution (without growth hacks)

- Keywords: "space governance", "orbital debris policy", "space traffic management", "civilisational design", "systems thinking policy"
- Each Brief gets an executive summary page (HTML) + PDF; internal links from Journal posts
- Newsletter: double opt-in, plaintext-first; archive on site; RSS feed
- Social: org @dornhelm, personal @tridor; consistent social cards; UTM naming convention

  

# 12) Launch checklist (6--8 weeks)

1. Register domains; set Cloudflare DNS

2. Choose stack (Ghost/Webflow to ship fast)

3. Create brand kit (wordmark, OG template, favicon, favicon mask)

4. Configure email (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), create core aliases

5. Build Phase-1 site pages and legal pages

6. Write Manifesto v0.1 + first essay; prep Brief #0 outline

7. Set up analytics (Plausible), sitemap, RSS

8. Prepare Salon #1 invite (Council) + landing explainer

9. Publish; announce via newsletter + personal social; start 1:1 outreach

10. Put a quarterly cadence in your calendar (content + salon)
* * *

## Bottom line

- Use dornhelm.org as the canonical home, with clear subdomains for Journal/Forum/Standards/Council.
- Launch with a lean, static-first site, privacy-respecting analytics, and rock-solid email/auth.
- Keep HoldCo on a separate brand/domain, share only what's necessary.
- Build credibility with consistent cadence and clean governance/ops; add complexity (Fellows, Observatory, APIs) only once the flywheel spins.
