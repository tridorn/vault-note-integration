Here's a crisp, ground-up way to structure the ecosystem you described--and how to actually build it without overreaching early.

- Dornhelm Institute: the visible brain--ideas, papers, standards, public forums.
- Dornhelm Council: the discreet engine--invite-only convenings, coalition building, off-the-record influence.
- HoldCo/studio: builds/backs ventures that operationalize the ideas; provides the shared ops stack to all parts.

  

# Start lean: the minimal viable structure (Month 0--3)

- One legal entity only: your HoldCo. Run both "Dornhelm Institute" (public) and "Dornhelm Council" (private) as programs/brands inside HoldCo to begin.
- Branding: masterbrand Dornhelm. Sub-brands: Institute (public), Council (semi-private), Journal (publishing), Forum (events).
- Cadence: 1 substantial essay/month + 1 private salon/quarter.
- Team (fractional/contract): you (Editor/Convener), 1 research associate, 1 ops/comms generalist, counsel on retainer.
- Budget target: €75--150k Year 1 for the platform (contractors, design, travel, events, counsel).

  

# Phased build plan (with clear "go/no-go" gates)

  

## Phase I -- Incubate and prove signal (Months 0--6)

  

Goals: credible voice + first network nucleus.
- Publish Manifesto/Constitution v0.1 + 2 essays (Dornhelm Journal).
- Host two invite-only salons (10--15 people each, Chatham House Rule).
- Build a stakeholder map (regulators, agencies, operators, investors, scientists). Start warm 1:1s.
- Stand up operating norms:

    - Public language = "research + convening + stakeholder engagement."

    - Private sessions under Chatham House Rule; agendas circulated, no minutes.

    - Basic conflicts log (internal) for topics overlapping your ventures.

  

Gate to Phase II: 3--5 senior stakeholders repeatedly engage, and at least one agency/industry body asks you for input.

  

## Phase II -- Formalize light shells (Months 6--12)

  

Goals: legitimacy + discretion, still lean.
- If you need grants/partners: incorporate Dornhelm Institute as a light nonprofit shell (jurisdiction & form per counsel). Keep the Council unincorporated (by-invitation program) or as a simple association.
- Create a 3-person Advisory Circle (ex-regulator, academic, operator) for Institute; not a heavy board.
- Publish Brief #1 (space-age governance topic) and Forum #1 (public event, 50--100 ppl).
- Draft engagement policy (what you disclose publicly; what remains private; how you manage COIs).
- Begin pilot coalitions (2--3 orgs each) around one concrete standard or sandbox.

  

Gate to Phase III: at least one coalition signs an MoU or a regulator invites you into a working group.

  

## Phase III -- Scale what works (Months 12--24)

  

Goals: repeatable influence → tangible outcomes.

- Institute: quarterly briefs; annual Dornhelm Forum; small Fellows cohort.
- Council: regular salons; closed-door taskforces tied to real deliverables (draft guideline, sandbox plan).
- HoldCo: spin/shape 1--2 ventures that operationalize Institute outputs; Council lines up early customers/partners.
- Consider a stewardship vehicle (foundation/purpose trust) only once the flywheel is clearly working, to anchor mission control long-term.

  

# Operating norms (so you're effective

# and

#  defensible)

  

Public (Institute)

- Tone: civilisational, standards-oriented, non-ideological.
- Commitments you can keep: "We publish research; we convene stakeholders; we engage policymakers."
- Avoid absolute promises (e.g., "we never lobby"); keep language broad.

  

Private (Council)

- Invite-only, rule-bound: Chatham House Rule, pre-cleared invite lists, counsel screens agendas.
- Outcomes = workstreams (drafts, pilot charters), not "minutes."
- If registration/reporting triggers exist in your jurisdiction, comply or stay below thresholds--design with counsel.

  

Conflicts & alignment

- Maintain a living interests registry (internal).
- For public pieces touching your ventures, add a one-line disclosure; in Council settings, you're explicit about roles.

  

# People you actually need (and when)

- Now: You; Research Associate (policy + synthesis); Ops/Comms (site, invites, logistics).
- 6--12 months: Part-time Government/Regulatory Counsel; Convenings Producer.
- 12--24 months: Policy Director (runs Institute cadence), Head of Network (runs Council/taskforces), Data Analyst (metrics & evidence).

  

# Money (sources & flows)

- Year 1: self-fund; modest sponsorships for Forum #1 if you want, with clear guardrails.
- Year 2+: add memberships, grants, fellowships, event revenue. Keep any donor >20% of budget under review to avoid capture.
- Spend discipline: content > convenings > design. Headcount stays lean and flexible.

  

# Influence pipeline (how "ideas → power" actually moves)

1. Thesis (essay/brief distilling a problem to a standard/sandbox).

2. Demand (1:1 briefings; Council salon tests appetite and red-flags).

3. Coalition (3--6 stakeholders commit to a workstream).

4. Pilot/Standard (draft + limited real-world pilot).

5. Institutionalization (regulator uptake, industry body endorsement, or procurement spec).

6. Venture (HoldCo spins/backs a company that implements; feedback loop to Institute).

  

# Data/ops & discretion (practical hygiene)

- Separate domains: @dornhelm.org (Institute/Council) and @holdco (business).
- Single source of truth (CRM/notes) with strict permissions; codify "OTR" tagging.
- For sensitive convenings: counsel present; agendas circulated; outcomes = taskings, not transcripts.

  

# Risks to pre-empt (and how)

- Reputational: Don't promise total transparency. Use principled, accurate public language from day one.
- Regulatory: Know lobbying/registration thresholds; design your Council formats to comply (counsel).
- Capture/astroturf: Diversify funding; keep an independent Advisory Circle; publish methodology, not back-room deals.
* * *

## Bottom line

- Start with one entity (HoldCo) and two branded programs (Institute public, Council private).
- Prove signal with consistent publishing and tight salons, then add shells (nonprofit/association) only when needed.
- Run everything on clear norms: public = ideas & convening; private = coalition workstreams.
- Tie outcomes to pilots/standards that your ventures can execute--this is where influence becomes durable.

  

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page launch checklist (names, domains, first topics, invite list template, salon format, quarterly publishing calendar) you can execute immediately.
