Great -- let's put together a rational, no-nonsense digital guide for setting up both your business HoldCo and Dornhelm (Institute + Council) so they're credible, easy to manage, and scalable.
* * *

# 1. Domains

  

### General principles

- Keep them clean and short.
- Separate business from movement. Even if legally connected, the public shouldn't feel they're the same thing.
- Secure variants early. (.org, .com, .net, and main social handles).
- Avoid "cute" suffixes (like .io or .xyz) for the policy/movement brand â†’ undermines gravitas.

  

### Suggested set

- Dornhelm (movement / institute / council):

    - dornhelm.org (primary, signals public interest/seriousness).

    - dornhelm.com (redirects to .org, protects brand).

    - dornhelm.net (optional, redirect).

    - Socials: @dornhelm everywhere you can (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Mastodon, etc).

    - Personal handle: @tridor (your consistent persona).
- Business HoldCo (venture engine):

    - yourholdconame.com (primary).

    - Avoid tying it too closely to Dornhelm (different tone, audience).

    - Keep neutral/professional; it's a capital allocator/venture studio, not a movement.
- Internal comms/collab:

    - Use a single Google Workspace or O365 across both, but keep domains separate. Example: name@dornhelm.org for movement, name@holdco.com for business.

# 2. Website structure

  

### For Dornhelm (public movement brand)

  

Keep it clean, minimal, authoritative. Suggested architecture:

- Home: Mission, latest essay/brief, clear tagline.
- About: Who we are (story, Tristan Dornhelm persona, advisory circle, constitution).
- Transparency: Disclosures, funding sources, principles.
- Journal: Essays, foresight pieces, research briefs.
- Forum: Events (salons, congress).
- Council (semi-private): Page is minimal â†’ "invite-only convenings; contact if relevant."
- Media/Press: Inquiries, coverage.
- Contact: Email form, socials.

  

ðŸ‘‰ Style: think Brookings or RAND but modern â†’ typographic logo, light palette, not heavy design.

* * *

### For Business HoldCo

  

Keep it stripped down and professional. Suggested structure:

- Home: "We are an evergreen venture studio and holding company. We build and acquire companies that solve real-world problems."
- Approach: 70/20/10 allocation, capital allocation philosophy.
- Ventures: Portfolio showcase (PlatformCos, AdjacentCos).
- Team: Core operating partners.
- Careers: Join us, EIR program.
- Contact: Investors, founders.

  

ðŸ‘‰ Style: think tiny Berkshire Hathaway meets Atomic/Founders Factory. Functional, not flashy.

# 3. General digital setup

  

### Hosting & CMS

- CMS: WordPress (flexible, easy to manage, SEO-friendly), or Webflow (design-first, no code).
- Hosting: Managed WordPress (e.g. WP Engine) or Webflow hosting.
- Keep both Dornhelm.org and HoldCo.com on the same backend (for ops efficiency) but different brand skins.

  

### Email & collaboration

- Google Workspace for both.

    - @dornhelm.org for Institute/Council.

    - @holdco.com for business.
- Shared drives but separate folders (Dornhelm vs. HoldCo).
- Internal Slack/Teams â†’ single workspace with channels per org.

  

### Newsletter

- Dornhelm Journal: use Substack or Ghost (easiest to build an audience, distribution built-in).
- Connect to journal.dornhelm.org.
- HoldCo: smaller list, just for LPs/partners (private updates via Mailchimp or ConvertKit).

  

### Social media

- Dornhelm: Twitter/X + LinkedIn (policy/professional audience). Mastodon/Bluesky optional.
- HoldCo: LinkedIn only (professional, not public narrative).
- Tridor: your personal voice, can cross-link but keep tone distinct (more speculative, explorative).
* * *

# 4. Content flow

- Dornhelm.org = public, "serious" brand.

    - All major essays, briefs, announcements live here.
- Substack (Dornhelm Journal) = distribution channel + community comments.

    - Cross-post essays.

    - Build email list from day one.
- Tridor persona = amplification.

    - Commentary, thoughts, promotion of essays.
- HoldCo site = static showcase.

    - No need for constant updates; just add ventures when relevant.
* * *

# 5. Security & professionalism (from day one)

- Use Cloudflare for both sites (DDoS + CDN).
- Enable 2FA on all accounts (domains, social, email).
- Register trademarks (at least in EU) for "Dornhelm."
- Draft a basic style guide (fonts, colors, tone) so the brand feels cohesive across Institute, Council, Journal, Forum.
* * *

# 6. Rational build order

Would you like me to sketch two concrete sitemap wireframes (one for Dornhelm.org, one for HoldCo.com), so you can literally hand them to a web designer and say "build this"?
