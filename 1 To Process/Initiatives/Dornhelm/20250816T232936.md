About Dornhelm

  

Dornhelm is a platform dedicated to shaping policy and standards for humanity's next frontier: the space age. We believe that as our species becomes interplanetary, governance must evolve beyond today's reactive, short-term systems. Our mission is to articulate principles, propose frameworks, and convene communities that prepare civilization for this transition.

  

Dornhelm publishes essays, foresight briefs, and research papers, and hosts dialogues that bring together scientists, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and citizens. Our focus is not ideology or populism, but a pragmatic civilisational perspective: how to design systems that are resilient, humane, and future-proof.

  

The name Dornhelm stands for a shield for the future--a commitment to stewarding humanity's long-term journey.

  

Who is behind Dornhelm?

  

Dornhelm was founded by Ben Jendyk, who writes and speaks publicly under the name Tristan Dornhelm. The use of a pen name reflects a separation of private and public life, while maintaining transparency: Tristan Dornhelm and Ben Jendyk are one and the same.

  

Tristan is an avid reader of science fiction and a builder of businesses. He created Dornhelm as the apex of his work: a platform for civilisational ideas that will remain independent even as his business ventures operate in parallel.

  

How Dornhelm works

- Journal -- Essays and policy ideas written by Tristan Dornhelm and contributors.
- Briefs -- Quarterly foresight reports on space governance and frontier technologies.
- Forum -- Convenings of thinkers and practitioners.
- Fellows -- A future program for researchers and advocates.

  

Dornhelm is at once a movement, a publishing platform, and a community. Its goal is simple: to help humanity govern the space age wisely.

- Any future donations, grants, or sponsorships will be listed here in full, with amounts and sources.

  

Business Links

- Advisory voices may join, but all content is signed and attributable.

Conflicts of Interest

Would you like me to sketch a 12-month cadence (when to publish essays, when to release briefs, when to host your first event) so you have a rhythm that feels credible but not overwhelming?
