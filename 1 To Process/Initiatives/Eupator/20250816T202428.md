That's a very sharp and fair point -- the equity split is the single biggest "cultural signal" your company will send to founders.

If you get it wrong, you'll repel the best talent and attract the wrong kind of people.

  

Let's break it down rationally:

* * *

## 1. Why studios often take ~50% at formation

- They supply more than capital. A proper studio provides:

    - Idea origination & validation (de-risked from day 0).

    - Pre-incorporation tech / IP / branding.

    - Shared services (CFO, GTM, recruiting, legal, data infra).

    - Capital for the first 12--18 months.
- From the studio perspective, they're replacing 2--3 years of founder grind and derisking.

  

But -- many studios fail precisely because founders feel like employees with upside rather than owners with agency.
* * *

## 2. What "founder-friendly" looks like

  

Great founders expect at least ~50% combined between them and their ESOP.

That's the psychological threshold where they feel like "the real owners."

If they end up at 25--30% combined, they'll walk.

* * *

## 3. Models that balance control with fairness

  

### (A)

### Majority-lite control (~35--45% HoldCo at start)

- Founders + ESOP: 55--65%
- Studio/HoldCo: 35--45%
- HoldCo keeps board control via founder agreements, veto rights, and protective provisions.
- Studio can buy pro-rata in future rounds to maintain influence.
- âœ… Founder-friendly, but you must trust governance mechanisms rather than raw equity %.
* * *

### (B)

### 50/50 split with ratchets

- Day 0: Founders + ESOP 50%, HoldCo 50%.
- Performance ratchet: If key milestones aren't hit, HoldCo earns step-up to 60%. If they are hit, founders step up to 60%.
- âœ… Aligns incentives dynamically, not just at the start.
* * *

### (C)

### Staged vesting of HoldCo equity

- Incorporate with HoldCo at, say, 40%.
- But 20% of that is contingent -- if HoldCo actually delivers on promised services/capital milestones, it vests.
- If not, it reverts to founders/ESOP.
- âœ… Forces the studio to prove its value; prevents "equity land grab."
* * *

### (D)

### Convertible capital instead of equity upfront

- HoldCo only takes 20--25% equity at founding.
- The rest of its "upside" is in the form of a convertible loan/note that can convert at the next priced round (with a modest discount).
- âœ… Lets founders start with majority ownership; HoldCo still gets rewarded when the company de-risks.
* * *

## 4. Practical recommendation for you

  

Since your intent is to build real-world value and long-term alignment (not a rent-seeking structure), I'd recommend:

- Default: HoldCo starts at 35--45%.

    - Founders + ESOP control the majority of upside.

    - You preserve strategic control through governance rights, not just equity %.
- ESOP pool must be meaningful (10--15%) from day one.

    - This ensures the next 20 hires feel like owners.
- Earn-in / ratchet system.

    - Founders who perform can edge ownership up.

    - Studio that delivers keeps its slice.

  

That way, nobody feels ripped off:

- Founders feel like owners, not employees.
- HoldCo still maintains control where it matters (capital allocation, board rights, IP).

ðŸ‘‰ The real trick: design the system so both HoldCo and founders can only get really rich if the company gets really big.

Would you like me to sketch some sample cap tables (Year 0 vs Year 3 vs post-Series A) under these different models so you can see exactly how dilution plays out for founders vs HoldCo? That often makes the tradeoffs crystal clear.
