Here is a **curated list of high-leverage Best Practice Maps** to deploy early. Each map is selected for its direct connection to **cash-rich, underserved pains**, fast credibility-building, and clear linkage to your service offerings.
* * *

## I. **Local SME Ops Modernisation**

Target: Geschäftsführung, back-office leads in 10--200 FTE firms (handwerk, Dienstleistung, Maschinenbau, Bildung, etc.)  
Goal: Show them how to escape fragmented, inefficient workflows without hiring consultants or IT staff.

| Map Title | Pain Solved | What It Leads To | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **"How to eliminate 10 hours/month of admin waste using Notion + Make.com"** | Manual duplication, missed tasks, no central dashboard | Clarity Audit → BizOps |

| **"How to build a central knowledge system for your team in 3 days"** | SOPs scattered across Word, paper, and heads | BizOps Blueprint Package |

* * *

## II. **Owner Enablement / Microfounder Ops**

Target: Small business owners or solo entrepreneurs with little time, no ops team.  
Goal: Make you look like a "tech-ops enabler" who gives them leverage immediately.

* * *

## III. **Professional Services (Ärzte, Kanzleien, Steuerberater)**

Target: Highly paid but operationally inefficient professionals.  
Goal: Provide lean, compliance-safe digitalisation they can't get from old-school providers.

| **"ISO-compliant client onboarding system for Kanzleien using Notion"** | No documentation, repeat mistakes, no audit-readiness | BizOps project | 
| **"Automated pre-visit checklist for Praxen: Reduce no-shows and misinfo"** | Manual reminders, phone chaos | Automation Sprint |

| **"Fast KPI reporting for small Kanzleien using Google Sheets + GPT"** | No overview, monthly chaos, wrong data | DataOps Dashboard Setup | 
* * *

## IV. **Backdoor into Public Sector + Nonprofits**

* * *

## V. **Meta Infrastructure (you show how you run yourself)**

Target: Prospects, junior founders, curious observers  
Goal: Build legitimacy via transparency. _"We run what we sell."_

| Map Title | Pain Solved | What It Leads To | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **"How Eupator runs client delivery in Notion"** | Show you practice what you sell | Indirect trust gain | 
| **"Our internal file hygiene SOP (and why it saves hours weekly)"** | Show systematisation discipline | Trust, authority, template sales | 
| **"Lead tracking and follow-up without a CRM: Our actual method"** | Cold leads slipping, no CRM loyalty | DIY CRM template offer | 
* * *

## VI. Execution Plan: First 3 Maps

Start with three that require **no external data** and solve **pain you've already understood:**

1. **"The DATEV-Ready Invoice Automation Blueprint"**  
→ High pain, high frequency, easy CTA.

2. **"How to eliminate 10 hours/month of admin waste using Notion + Make.com"**  
→ Positioning map + flexible use.

3. **"How Eupator runs client delivery in Notion"**  
→ Build credibility from day 1.

If you want, I can provide a **template structure** for each map (outline + prompt set + visuals list). Ask and I'll build that next.
