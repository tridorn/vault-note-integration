**System = Two inter-locking lanes.**  
Lane A = _Startup Factory_ (public, grant-funded).  
Lane B = _Eupator Studio_ (private, equity-funded).

Below is the full end-to-end workflow in ten stages, with roles, hand-offs, and ownership unambiguously separated.

* * *

### 0 Strategic Setup (standing state, no projects yet)

| Factory (gGmbH) | Studio (GmbH/UG) | 
| ---- | ----  |
| • Maintains MoUs with universities, corporates, city. | • Maintains venture theses and sector heat-maps. | 
| • Holds BMWK grant budget and programme staff. | • Holds capital, templates, shared ops stack. | 

No overlap: one controls **legitimacy + grants**, the other **capital + execution**.
* * *

### 1 Scouting

**Factory's actions**

1. Dispatches liaison officers into KIT, TU Darmstadt, Mannheim chairs.

2. Screens lab disclosures, PhD posters, corporate R&D wish-lists.

3. Collects 1-page "Opportunity Cards".

**Studio role**  
‒ Passive observer. Receives weekly scouting digest; no direct contact with researchers.

* * *

### 2 Intake

**Factory**

1. Selects ~30 cards per quarter.

2. Runs _triage interviews_ (IP status, TRL, founder intent).

3. Admits 8--10 into the **Validation Sprint**.

**Studio**  
‒ Reviews intake list, flags ideas aligned with active theses but **does not yet intervene**.

* * *

### 3 Validation Sprint (6 weeks, Factory-run)

Week 0 kick-off → Week 6 demo day  
• Factory assigns venture architect, €8 k prototype budget, weekly milestone reviews.  
• Mandatory mixed teams: ≥1 tech originator + ≥1 business recruit (often Mannheim MBA).  
• Kill ratio target ≥50 %.

Studio remains **hands-off**; attends week-3 checkpoint as silent observer.

* * *

### 4 Option Gate (connection point #1)

Immediately after sprint demo day:

1. Factory issues **Option Memorandum** per surviving project.  
Contains: IP licence template, sprint data room, founder résumés, burn forecast.

2. Eupator has **60 days ROFR** to accept or decline.

Decision matrix (Studio):

- Market fit with thesis?
- Team completeness?
- CapEx ≤ €200 k to seed milestone?
- Dilution path manageable?
* * *

### 5 If Studio _declines_

Project returns to Factory pool → open auction to external VCs or corporate venture units.  
Factory's KPI is still met (spin-out ready); Studio involvement ends.

### 6 If Studio _accepts_ (connection point #2)

**Studio actions (0--14 days after acceptance)**

1. Drafts incorporation docs → Newco GmbH (founders 70 %, Studio 20 %, ESOP 10 %).

2. Signs IP licence with university via Factory template.

3. Transfers €25--50 k pre-seed from studio convertible.

4. Assigns shared ops stack (legal, design, growth engineer).

Factory closes its role in this project; retains KPI credit.

* * *

### 7 Build Phase (Studio-run, 90 days)

• Studio drives weekly sprint cadence (product, customer, regulatory).  
• Milestones: functional MVP, first LoI or pilot, seed-round data room.  
• Uses Factory facilities (lab, cowork) under _cost + 15 %_ SLA.

Factory monitors only for grant compliance (no control, no equity).

* * *

### 8 Seed Syndication (connection point #3)

Studio leads seed (~€1 m) → invites angels/HTGF.  
Factory provides non-dilutive co-funding (EXIST-Transfer, regional grants) if applicable.

Ownership stays 100 % private; Factory holds **no shares** but gains headline success metric.
* * *

### 9 Scale & Exit (Studio domain)

• Studio keeps board seat, pro-rata rights.  
• Founders graduate from shared ops after Series A.  
• Upon exit, Studio realises carry; Factory lists success in impact report.

* * *

## Role Summary (Reason-for-Being)

| Dimension | Factory | Studio | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Primary goal** | Convert research & regional assets into _validated opportunities_ | Convert those opportunities into _funded, scalable companies_ | 
| **Funding** | Grants, sponsorship, membership dues | Equity returns, management fees | 
| **Control** | Programme design, IP template, veto on licence misuse | Cap table, budget, execution pace | 
| **Success KPI** | # projects delivered to Option Gate & accepted by any investor | Portfolio IRR, exit volume, equity retained | 
| **Risk profile** | Programmatic, low financial risk | High financial risk, high upside | 
| **Stakeholder optics** | Neutral, multi-stakeholder, public good | Private, operator-led, returns-driven |

### Distinct Yet Inter-locking

_Factory_ = _filter_ and _funnel_ driven by **credibility, grants, institutional breadth**.  
_Studio_ = _forge_ driven by **capital, speed, ownership discipline**.  
Handoffs occur only three times: **Option Gate, Build SLA, Seed-grant blending**.  
No other overlaps--ensures clear optics for public partners and clear equity capture for you.
