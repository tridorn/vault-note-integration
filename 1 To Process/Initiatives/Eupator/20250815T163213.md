A tighter brief: "Outline the concrete steps, documentation, advisors, and decision points for a founder who will form a German UG now and emigrate to the UAE (Dubai) in a few years, with an eye to avoiding German tax traps."

  

Here is the playbook you actually need.

  

# First-order constraints you must design around

- Exit tax (Wegzugsbesteuerung, §6 AStG). If on exit you have held ≥1% in any corporation within the look-back (now 12 years), Germany deems a sale at fair value and taxes the unrealised gain. Since 2022 there is no open-ended, interest-free deferral; only an application for up to 7 annual instalments, typically with security for moves to non-EU/EEA states. UAE moves fall squarely into that bucket.
- Extended limited tax liability (§2 AStG). If you leave to a low-tax state (generally < two-thirds of German burden) and retain "wesentliche wirtschaftliche Interessen" in Germany, you can be pulled into a harsher German tax net for 10 years after exit. UAE will generally qualify as "niedrig besteuert." Avoid triggering criteria.
- No Germany--UAE tax treaty since 31 Dec 2021. There is no tie-breaker for dual residence and no dividend WHT relief via treaty. German-source dividends to a UAE resident are withheld at 25% + 5.5% solidarity surcharge = 26.375%; corporate recipients may claim a 40% refund down to ~15.825% in some cases, but individuals cannot.
- Place of effective management (PoEM) risk. A German UG remains German-resident (legal seat), but if you run it from Dubai, the UAE can also treat it as resident under its CT law (PoEM), creating dual residence without a treaty tie-breaker. Keep effective management in Germany or restructure deliberately.
- Residence termination is factual. Keeping any usable home in Germany sustains unlimited tax liability regardless of "Abmeldung." Residence is defined by §8 AO (Wohnsitz) and §9 AO (gewöhnlicher Aufenthalt; six-month rule).

  

# The sequence that works (and why)

  

## 12--24 months before exit

1. Decide what you'll keep in Germany.

If you plan to keep the UG long term while you live in Dubai, you must either:

a) Anchor PoEM in Germany (German-resident MD with real authority, board/GM meetings, decision logs in Germany), or

b) Stop using the UG as an operating vehicle and build a UAE entity for new business; keep the UG "quiet."

This avoids UAE PoEM and double-residence problems.

2. Model your exit tax base early.

Build a defensible valuation pack (IDW S1-style DCF/Ertragswert, cap table, last round docs, contracts). Time your move before value spikes from financings or exits.

3. Choose your cash-extraction path post-move.

With no UAE treaty, direct dividends to you will face 26.375% German WHT. If distributions matter, consider introducing an EU holding company with substance (real activity, people, office) well before you leave; under §43b EStG / EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive WHT can be reduced to 0% for qualifying EU parents, but Germany's §50d(3) anti-treaty-shopping will be applied hard. Substance or don't bother.

4. Audit your "wesentliche wirtschaftliche Interessen."

To avoid §2 AStG for 10 years, reduce German ties below thresholds (e.g., share of German-source income, managerial roles, significant domestic assets). If you can't, at least plan for progressive rates via worldwide-income progression.

5. Select advisors (and sequence them).

    - International tax Steuerberater with AStG depth;

    - Fachanwalt für Steuerrecht for structuring and rulings;

    - Gesellschaftsrecht/Notar for corporate changes;

    - Valuation firm (IDW S1) for exit-day FMV;

    - UAE CT adviser for PoEM, TRC, free-zone/regulatory;

    - Optional: Verbindliche Auskunft under §89 AO on contentious points (timing, cost-based; only when truly material).

  

## 6--9 months before exit

6. Lock down residence facts.

Cancel or sublet the German home permanently; terminate long-term contracts; exit Vereinsmitgliedschaften and church; document everything. Obtain UAE lease (Ejari), residence visa, Emirates ID and later an FTA Tax Residency Certificate.

7. Paper the management of the UG.

Appoint a Germany-resident Geschäftsführer with actual decision rights; minute where GM decisions are taken; store accounting and board files in Germany; implement a travel/meeting calendar. German PoEM guidance expects decisions where they're actually made.

8. Prepare the Wegzug file.

Draft the valuation memo; assemble share purchase agreements, financing docs, IP assignments, option plans, and forecasts. This is what your Finanzamt will pick apart when exit tax is assessed.

  

## At exit (week of the move)

9. Execute the formalities cleanly.

    - Abmeldung at the Bürgeramt; keep the Abmeldebescheinigung.

    - Flight, moving invoices, utility terminations, handover protocol, deregistered car.

    - Register in UAE; start TRC clock.

10. File for exit tax treatment and (if needed) instalments.

When assessed, apply for 7-year instalments; expect security (bank guarantee, pledge). Calendar the due dates.

  

## First 12 months abroad

11. Prove non-residence by conduct, not intention.

No German dwelling available for your use; keep German days below 183; maintain contemporaneous travel logs. If you keep any German home, German unlimited tax liability can persist.

12. Cash flows:

    - Dividends from the UG: expect 26.375% WHT absent an EU HoldCo route; if a corporation is the recipient, seek the partial refund to ~15.825% via BZSt, but this does not help you as an individual.

    - Director fees/salary: typically German-taxable for a German UG managing director; structure carefully with your adviser.

13. UAE compliance:

If you inadvertently centralise decisions in Dubai, you can create UAE CT residency for the UG via PoEM; if you form a UAE entity, register for CT (9%) as required.

  

# Documentation you should maintain from now

- Residence termination: Abmeldebescheinigung, lease termination and handover, deregistration of utilities/insurances, sale of car, bank change-of-address confirmations.
- New residence: UAE tenancy (Ejari), Emirates ID, residence visa, FTA TRC once eligible.
- Presence logs: travel diary, boarding passes, passport scans showing entry/exit.
- UG governance: board/GM minutes showing decision-making in Germany; management service contracts; delegation registers.
- Valuation pack (exit-day): IDW S1-style report, DCF model, comps, sensitivity, and a memo on key assumptions; cap table and financing docs.

  

# Who to hire, in what order

1. International tax Steuerberater experienced in AStG and §6 cases.

2. Fachanwalt für Steuerrecht to structure and, where truly material, draft a §89 AO verbindliche Auskunft (there are fees; cost depends on the matter's value).

3. Valuation firm (IDW S1 competence).

4. UAE CT adviser for TRC, PoEM guardrails, free-zone regime decisions.

5. Notar/Gesellschaftsrechtler if you add an EU HoldCo or alter the UG's governance.

  

# Decision nodes (my recommendations)

- Keep the UG or sunset it?

If you plan to distribute profits while living in Dubai, either install an EU substance holdco to reduce German WHT under §43b EStG or stop using the German company as a distribution vehicle. Paying yourself directly from the UG after exit is a structurally expensive choice in your scenario.

- Management location:

Unless you have a treaty safety net, do not manage the UG from Dubai. Appoint a German-resident MD with real authority and audit-proof processes.

- Timing of exit:

Move before valuation inflection points. Every euro of latent gain at exit is taxed; the 7-year instalment helps cash flow, not the quantum.

- German ties:

Eliminate "wesentliche wirtschaftliche Interessen" to stay clear of §2 AStG for 10 years post-exit. If you cannot, price the residual German tax exposure into your model and accept it as the cost of keeping those ties.

  

# Minimal checklist to start this quarter

- Engage the Steuerberater; commission an indicative IDW S1 valuation baseline.
- Decide on EU holdco feasibility; if yes, begin substance build-out now (people, office, functions) or don't do it.
- Draft a PoEM control memo for the UG and appoint a German-resident Geschäftsführer with board calendar and decision log.
- Map and begin extinguishing German residential ties per §8/§9 AO.
- Build your exit file: valuation, contracts, forecasts, and a narrative explaining why assumptions are reasonable.

  

This is the lean path: reduce avoidable friction (WHT and PoEM), document residence facts to shut the door on unlimited liability, and treat exit tax as a number you minimise by timing and valuation, not as something you can wish away.
