love this question--because the way you let money in (and put money out) will make or break the "compounder studio" you're building. Here's a tight, actionable blueprint for external investment into you and you investing into others, with structures that keep control and compounding intact.

# 1) Letting outsiders invest in

# you

#  (without losing the plot)

  

## A. HoldCo (evergreen "permanent capital")

  

When to use: build the long-term compounding base and fund the studio + small acquisitions.
- Instrument: plain equity (common or non-participating preferred).
- Ownership target: founders + core team ≥60--70% after the first round.
- Protections you keep: board majority at HoldCo, veto on issuing super-voting stock, change of control, and asset sales.
- Investor economics: dividends/buybacks from HoldCo cash flows + NAV growth; no forced exit clock.
- Share classes:

    - A shares (voting) -- founders/operators.

    - B shares (non-voting) -- external investors; same economics, fewer control rights.
- Use of proceeds: fund shared services, seed 2--4 studio builds/yr, small bolt-ons, and maintain 6--12 months of HoldCo runway.

  

Why this works: you avoid the "fund life" pressure that forces premature exits and can truly hold winners.

  

## B. Sidecar Fund (or rolling SPVs)

  

When to use: follow-ons and larger acquisitions where you want extra firepower without selling more HoldCo.

- Structure: deal-by-deal SPVs or a small evergreen sidecar (e.g., €50--€100M).
- Economics (keep it modest): 1% management fee (or deal costs only) + 10--15% carry after a 6--8% hurdle, European waterfall. GP (HoldCo) commits 2--5%.
- Governance: LPs get transparency and economics; HoldCo keeps deal control (sourcing, terms, and board seats).
- Allocation rule: HoldCo minimum 30--50% of each check until it hits a defined single-name risk cap; sidecar fills the rest.

  

Why this works: scales capital while keeping strategy/operator incentives pure.

  

## C. OpCo-level co-invest

  

When to use: bring in strategic partners, key angels, or local operators at the subsidiary--not at HoldCo.

- Docs: standardized minority preferred (non-participating), 1× liquidation preference (non-compounding), broad-based anti-dilution, no redemption rights.
- Controls: HoldCo holds board majority or at least vetoes on financing, M&A, CEO change, budget.
- Founder alignment: ESOP 10--15% fully diluted; clear vesting and acceleration only on true change of control.

# 2) You investing in

# other companies

#  (buy vs. partner vs. punt)

  

## A. Control buys (Platform or bolt-on)

- Target profile: €2--15M EBITDA with fixable ops; or product/tech assets that complete your platform.
- Capital stack: 50--70% equity from HoldCo/Sidecar, modest senior debt (≤2.0--2.5× EBITDA) to keep resilience.
- Terms: 80--100% purchase with earn-outs (12--24 months, tied to contribution profit) to de-risk.
- Playbook: Day-1 plug into Shared Services, 100-day value creation plan, KPI cadence, and synergy scorecard.

  

## B. Influential minority (20--40%) with

## optionality

- Use when: great team + strategic adjacency, but full control isn't needed (yet).
- Instruments: preferred equity with:

    - information rights,

    - negative controls (financing/M&A/budget),

    - ROFR/ROFO on future sales,

    - call option to acquire control at pre-defined EV/EBITDA bands,

    - warrants that step-up on hitting integration milestones.
- Outcome: you preserve upside and a path to control without overpaying on day one.

  

## C. Passive venture bets (max 10% of capital)

- Rule: only when it gives you distribution, data, or a future acquisition option.
- Docs: simple SAFE/convertible with MFN; ask for commercial partnership rights.
* * *

# 3) Decision rules that keep discipline

- Buy vs. Build filter:

    - If time-to-market advantage > 12 months or customer access is scarce → Buy.

    - If your studio can hit v1 in < 6 months with existing GTM → Build.
- Pricing guardrails:

    - Majority deals: pay up to what yields 15% unlevered IRR, 25%+ with synergies.

    - Minorities: underwrite to 3× MOIC probability-weighted within 5--7 years.
- Portfolio caps:

    - Single-name exposure ≤ 25% of HoldCo NAV;

    - Sector exposure ≤ 60%;

    - Venture/passive basket ≤ 10%.
* * *

# 4) Cash flow & control mechanics (so incentives don't drift)

- OpCo → HoldCo: quarterly dividends of X% of FCF unless reinvestment ROI > pre-set hurdle (say, 25% IRR).
- HoldCo → Sidecar: co-invest per allocation rule; GP promote only on realized outcomes.
- Recycles: partial secondaries (sell 10--30%) at de-risked milestones to reload cash; full exits only if your moat is broken or pricing is irrational.
* * *

# 5) Example capital plan (illustrative, scale as needed)

  

Year 0--1 (build the engine)

- Raise €20--30M HoldCo equity (evergreen).
- Secure €10--20M committed sidecar (first close; rolling adds).
- Add €5--10M revolver at HoldCo (unsecured or asset-backed against receivables/FCF).

  

Use of funds (first 24 months):

- Studio: 4 launches × €1--1.5M = €4--6M.
- Bolt-ons: 2 acquisitions at €6--10M EV each, 60% equity/40% debt = €8--12M equity.
- Follow-ons & working capital: €6--8M.
- Central stack + reserves: €2--4M.

  

By Month 24--30: target 2 OpCos throwing combined €3--5M FCF/yr to HoldCo; recycle into Wave 2.

* * *

# 6) Instruments you'll actually use (cheat sheet)

- Control buy: SPA + earn-out; Seller rollover 10--20%; senior debt (2.0--2.5×); reps & warranties insurance if needed.
- Structured minority: preferred equity, 1× non-participating, board observer/seat, vetoes, ROFR/ROFO, call option, performance warrants.
- Venture-style: SAFE/convertible with discount + cap; MFN; commercial side letter (distribution rights).
- Credit: revolver at HoldCo; venture debt at OpCo once ARR > €5--8M with net retention >100%.
- Revenue-based financing: good for working-capital-heavy but seasonal businesses; keep it <10--12% blended cost.
* * *

# 7) Governance & reporting that LPs and operators both like

- HoldCo Board: 3--5 seats (founders majority); 1 seat for anchor HoldCo investor after a threshold (e.g., €20M invested).
- Investment Committee (IC): 3 members (CEO, CIO/Head of M&A, independent operator). Only IC can sign term sheets > €2M.
- Quarterly package: look-through P&L by OpCo, cash conversion, ROIC, reinvestment pipeline, and variance vs. value-creation plans.
- Sidecar LPAC: 3--5 members; conflict policies predefined; co-investment allocation formula published.
* * *

# 8) Light-touch regulatory note (EU context)

  

If you raise a pooled sidecar/fund from external investors in Europe, you'll trip AIFMD thresholds. The common path is to use a licensed AIFM or a hosted solution; your GP (HoldCo) acts as investment advisor. (Not legal advice--just the operating reality to budget for.)

* * *

# 9) Default play I recommend for you

1. Keep HoldCo sacred: raise one evergreen HoldCo round; avoid complex prefs and redemptions.

2. Use a small sidecar for the bigger, later checks; keep fees/carry modest.

3. Standardize OpCo minority docs so strategics can participate without hurting control.

4. Bias to control or structured minority with a path to control. Passive positions should be rare and strategic.

5. Reinvest operating cash first; use external capital to accelerate, not to substitute for discipline.

If you want, I can turn this into a 2-page Capital Formation Memo (with sample terms and an allocation waterfall) and a simple model you can tweak for check sizes, ownership, and FCF--just tell me your likely vertical focus and target deal size range.
