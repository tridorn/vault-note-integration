### Strategic Incorporation Plan (2025-2028)

Role: I am acting as your pragmatic counsel. Objective: maximise operational flexibility for the next three German years **and** minimise the exit-tax (Wegzugsteuer) exposure when you relocate permanently to Dubai.

## 1 Base Structure to Adopt **now**

| Layer                                        | Legal form          | Shareholder      | Purpose                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Eupator Holding UG (haftungsbeschränkt)**  | min. €1 000 capital | **You** (100 %)  | Keeps all participations; receives profits tax-light (95 % exempt) |
| **Eupator Ventures UG (haftungsbeschränkt)** | €1 000 capital      | Holding UG 100 % | Runs the Ops cells and any Tier-2 businesses                       |

Why start with two UGs instead of one?

1. **Early, low-valuation transfer**
   – You incorporate both on the *same day* and have the notary record that Holding pays in the share capital of Operating UG.
   – No goodwill, no hidden reserves; the fiscal book value is exactly €1 000.
   – Under § 6 Abs. 5 KStG the share transfer is tax-neutral, so you lock in today’s negligible valuation.
2. **Deferred exit tax base**
   – When you leave Germany you will own **only the Holding UG shares**. The exit tax will be levied on their fair-market value, which equals the *net equity* of the holding. By keeping most excess cash inside the operating company (or reinvesting it) you keep the holding’s value lean.
3. **Dividend reinvestment**
   – Dividends flow Holding → Operating at 1.5 % effective corporate tax (5 % of 30 % CIT/SolZ) and can be recycled into new ventures.
4. **Ring-fenced risk**
   – If a single Ops cell implodes contractually, only the operating UG is liable.

> **Cost:** ± €1 600 notary & court fees for two UGs; ± €300/yr extra accounting.
> **Pay-off:** material reduction of future exit-tax base and cleaner reinvestment loop.

## 2 Capital & Governance Choices

| Topic                 | Recommendation                                                           | Rationale                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Share capital**     | €1 000 each UG                                                           | Legitimate, keeps liquidity; German banks accept if account balance matches after formation  |
| **Musterprotokoll**   | Use for **Operating UG** only                                            | Fast & cheap; holding needs tailored charter (dividend conduit, intra-group loans)           |
| **Managing director** | You serve both UGs                                                       | Later you can appoint a UAE-resident co-MD to shift PoEM without triggering German CFC rules |
| **Accounting**        | Lexoffice + Steuerberater “review” tier                                  | Holding books are trivial; combine VAT groups after first year                               |
| **Trademark**         | Register “Eupator” (word mark, classes 35 41 42) once HRB numbers issued | Shields IP before global roll-out                                                            |

## 3 Exit-Tax (Wegzugsteuer) Mechanics & Mitigation

### Current law (as of 2025)

* Applies if you hold **≥ 1 %** of any German or foreign corporation when giving up German tax residency (AStG § 6) ([Lexology][1]).
* Move to a non-EU state (UAE) ► tax becomes **due immediately**; instalment payment over **7 years** possible, but the Finanzamt will demand **bank guarantee or pledge**. Interest accrues. ([Dubai-auswandern][2])
* Tax base = fair-market value minus acquisition cost of the shares **you personally own at exit**.

### Mitigation levers

| Lever                                   | Timing              | Effect                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Early holding**                       | *Now*               | Locks in negligible book value transfer – future growth sits one layer below you                                                       |
| **Dividend drainage**                   | Year 2-3            | Distribute excess cash from Operating UG to Holding and onward to you **before** exit; exit tax is then assessed on lower equity value |
| **IP / business sale to third parties** | ≤ 6 months pre-exit | Liquidity event is taxed normally (≈26.375 %), but removes that value from exit-tax base                                               |
| **Valuation control**                   | 3 rd year           | Commission conservative IDW S1 report; avoid external VC rounds inflating fair value                                                   |
| **Security planning**                   | 6 months pre-exit   | Arrange bank guarantee for 7-year instalment or pre-fund a dedicated account                                                           |
| **Sever German ties fully**             | At relocation       | De-register residence, close German office lease, < 183-day presence, no habitual abode → prevents secondary tax residence claims      |

There is **no treaty** between Germany and UAE; Germany keeps full taxing rights on unrealised gains. No workaround exists once shares appreciate and you leave.

## 4 Operational Playbook for the Next 36 Months

| Phase               | Legal / Fiscal action                                                             | Business action                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0-3 m**           | Incorporate both UGs, open Qonto accounts, trademark filing                       | Launch first Ops cell, push revenue inside Operating UG       |
| **3-12 m**          | Elect **Organschaft** if VAT pooling saves admin                                  | Accumulate profits; reinvest in Tier 2 prototypes             |
| **Year 2**          | If retained earnings > €25 k convert Operating UG → GmbH (simple HRB filing)      | Pay Holding UG a small dividend; reinvest majority            |
| **Year 3 Q1**       | Commission formal valuation of Holding UG; start security dialogue with Finanzamt | Finalise Dubai residency logistics                            |
| **Year 3 Q3**       | File Wegzugsteuer advance calc; decide: full payment vs 7-year instalment         | Appoint UAE co-MD, move PoEM if beneficial                    |
| **Relocation date** | De-register (§ 8 AO), file final German tax return incl. exit tax                 | Continue operations cross-border; UAE profits untaxed locally |

## 5 Best-Practice Alerts

1. **No private withdrawals** from Operating UG that jeopardise minimum capital; keep clean books—BMF audits exit-cases meticulously.
2. **All intra-group loans** must be at arm’s-length interest; document via board minutes.
3. **Family foundation** or gift to spouse abroad before exit **does not avoid** tax if recipient is non-resident (§ 6 AStG extended scope) ([McDermott][3]).
4. **IP migration** to UAE subsidiary triggers hidden-reserve exit tax at corporate level—evaluate only if brand valuation is minor.
5. **Consult a UAE tax lawyer** on ESR (Economic Substance Regulations) compliance once revenue shifts to Dubai; UAE now enforces ESR for free-zone entities.

### Bottom Line

* **Two-layer UG structure today** is the sweet spot: trivial cost now, material valuation shield later.
* **Exit-tax is inevitable** but can be 5- to 6-figure smaller if you lock in low holding equity and drain excess cash pre-move.
* Keep governance immaculate; the Finanzamt’s audit scope reaches **10 years back** for exit cases.

If you need template notary language for the double-UG formation or a timetable of tax-office filings, ask and I’ll draft them.
