1. Strategic objective  
The architecture must simultaneously (a) manufacture venture-scale companies at repeatable cadence and (b) institutionalise the pipeline of research talent and IP that feeds those companies. The dual-core structure--private venture studio plus public cross-university factory--satisfies both requirements while matching Germany's funding instruments and regulatory norms.

2. Why venture studio at the core  
Venture studios demonstrably outperform accelerators on hard outcomes. A 3 452-deal dataset shows a 24 % exit ratio for studio-originated ventures versus 14 % for accelerator cohorts ([InNiches](https://inniches.com/big-venture-studio-research)). A separate 2025 meta-analysis finds 34 % versus 21 % and highlights the decisive advantage: studios retain 30-50 % ownership against 6-8 % for accelerators, giving materially higher power-law upside per euro of studio opex ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-role-framework-definitive-classification-venture-matthew-burris-k96ie)). Higher initial equity also allows a leaner follow-on fund; fee income is a small accessory, not the business model.

3. Why a cross-university factory as feeder  
Multi-institution collaboration raises the probability of top-1 % impact research outputs as the number of distinct organisations in a team increases ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03694)). The German Federal Ministry's Startup-Factories programme explicitly subsidises such consortia: five to ten regional factories will receive 50 % public co-funding for 2025-2030, with mandatory private partners ([bmwk.de](https://www.bmwk.de/Thema/Startup/EN/Navigation/home.html)). Positioning the factory as a gGmbH aligns with this grant logic, offers tax exemption on surplus, and shields universities from direct commercial exposure.

4. Structural blueprint

| Component  |  Legal form  |  Primary function  |  Revenue / upside | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Eupator Studio  |  GmbH (for-profit)  |  Concept origination, build teams, supply shared operations stack  |  15-25 % equity per spin-out, 2 % management fee on €20-30 m follow-on fund | 
| Rhine-Neckar Startup Factory  |  gGmbH (non-profit)  |  Pre-company validation, founder matching, IP transfer, grant administration  |  Public grants + corporate membership dues | 
| Interaction contract  |  Option & SLA set  |  Studio receives right-of-first-refusal on factory projects; pays cost + 15 % for shared staff; factory holds 2 % carried interest pool to avoid state-aid issues |  | 

Governance  
• Supervisory Board with three equal blocks: universities, corporates, and Eupator.  
• Conflict committee triggered on valuation disputes above €250 k.  
• IP licensing template pre-ratified by tech-transfer offices; royalty-free until Series A, then 1 % net sales cap.

Capital flows  
Grants (EXIST, municipal) → Factory operations.  
Family-office seed + HTGF co-investment → Studio capex.  
Studio equity realisations and fund carry → Investor returns.

5. Comparative advantages over alternative models  
Incubator alone lacks concentrated equity; accelerator assumes deal flow that Mannheim currently does not generate; pure VC captures upside but contributes limited operating muscle. The paired model triangulates: factory supplies legitimacy and research depth, studio supplies execution velocity and capital discipline. Risk is diversified: public funds amortise discovery risk, private capital targets scalable winners.

6. Design principles to preserve  
• Separate balance-sheets: keeps grant compliance clean and makes studio bankable.  
• Tight option window (60 days post-MVP) to prevent indefinite warehousing of projects.  
• Mandatory mixed founder dyads (business + technical) to neutralise Mannheim's talent skew.

Adopt this dual-core construct. It maximises grant leverage, concentrates equity, and embeds governance acceptable to both academia and private LPs, providing a credible chassis for a region-anchored "Silicon Valley of Europe."
