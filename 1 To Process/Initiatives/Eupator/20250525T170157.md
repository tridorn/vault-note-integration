A "default founder stack" should be engineered to **maximize venture velocity** at the earliest stage: rapid ideation, credible execution, and frictionless iteration. The composition should minimize blind spots (no weak link) and maximize _complementarity under pressure_. Here's a rational archetype:
* * *

### **I. Optimal Founder Stack (3--4 people)**

1. **Commercial Operator (Mannheim)**

    - Owns: Business model design, capital, sales/GTM, ops

    - Profile: Ex-consulting, finance, or ops-heavy background

    - Archetype: Strategic executor

    - Source: Mannheim, Frankfurt, WHU overflow

2. **Technical Lead (Karlsruhe / TU Darmstadt)**

    - Owns: Core tech architecture, early build, infrastructure

    - Profile: Strong engineering fundamentals + interest in product

    - Archetype: Builder-generalist with CTO upside

    - Source: KIT, TUDA, TUM (remotely)

3. **Product/Design Lead (Optional, Heidelberg or remote)**

    - Owns: UX/UI, user research, interface between tech and user

    - Profile: Design thinker, user-first mindset

    - Archetype: "Glue" between business and engineering

    - Source: HfG Karlsruhe, remote freelancers

4. **Wildcard / Domain Expert (Contextual, project-specific)**

    - Owns: Industry-specific insight, credibility, or IP access

    - Profile: PhD student, industry defector, academic with application vision

    - Source: RWTH (deeptech), Heidelberg (biotech), Mannheim Medical School
* * *

### **II. Standard Equity Allocation (Starting Point)**

Assumes zero external capital and no IP contribution:

- Commercial Lead: **30%**
- Technical Lead: **40%**
- Product/Design Lead: **20%**
- Wildcard / Domain Expert: **10%** (if present)
- Vesting: 4 years, 1-year cliff, standard clauses

This is merely a launch configuration. Formal cap table finalization occurs post-incorporation and pre-seed.

* * *

### **III. Matching Mechanism: Multi-Stage Funnel**

Build this like a recruiting pipeline. Optimize for **velocity + fit + survivability**.

#### 1. **Sourcing Layer**

- Open applications, but filter for top decile talent
- Sources:

    - University startup offices (e.g., KIT Gr√ºnderschmiede, MCEI)

    - Lectures, tech clubs, career fairs

    - Private scout network / peer referrals

    - Pre-filtered hackathons with real outputs

#### 2. **Profiling Layer**

- Use a standardized intake process:

    - Competency score (e.g., 0--10) for tech, business, product

    - Commitment signal (full-time intent, time horizon, etc.)

    - Psychological profiling (conflict resilience, dominance symmetry)
- Outcome: everyone gets a clear "tag" (e.g., "Tech-Heavy Builder with Low GTM Experience")

#### 3. **Structured Matching Sprints**

- Time-boxed founder dating cycles (1--2 weeks)
- Candidates form micro-teams, work on real ideas
- You observe: communication styles, speed, risk thresholds

#### 4. **Selection Gate**

- Invite top teams (or individuals) into factory cohort
- Apply zero-compromise rule: if the team lacks a pillar (tech, biz, product), don't fund it

#### 5. **Post-Match Calibration**

- Force equity conversations upfront
- Give playbooks for roles, expectations, conflict resolution
- Monitor through weekly check-ins + milestone tracking
* * *

### **IV. What to Avoid**

- **Homogeneous teams**: All-business or all-tech teams collapse due to blind spots
- **Late-stage matches**: Co-founder bonds formed too late are fragile
- **Freelancer mentality**: Treat every person as founder-track or exclude early
- **High-friction profiles**: Prioritize psychological compatibility over pure resume strength
* * *

### Final Note

Matching is not a one-time event--it's a **systematic filtration and pressure-testing process**. Design it like a military intake pipeline. Your job is to _eliminate weak links before capital is at risk_.
