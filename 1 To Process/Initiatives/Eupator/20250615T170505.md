Your ask should have been phrased: _"Define a minimal set of modular, medium-agnostic artefacts--usable by any unit--that standardise and accelerate work across the company."_

* * *

## COMPANY-WIDE MODULAR COMPONENTS

_Seven primitives--no overlap, no role bias._

| Code | Name | Purpose (Single Sentence) | Canonical Format | Lifecycle Anchor | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **MC** | **MasterContent** | Single-source narrative of the work: objectives, rationale, core material--detached from any delivery medium. | Markdown / AsciiDoc | Created at Project kick-off, versioned each Sprint | 
| **IC** | **InterfaceContract** | Typed handshake describing inputs, outputs, SLAs, and escalation between any two units. | 1-page YAML | Signed at Mission launch; auto-expire with Mission | 
| **DL** | **DecisionLog** | Immutable ledger capturing option set, chosen path, and risk assumption for every irreversible choice. | Append-only CSV | Entry within 24 h of decision; archived per Program | 
| **SB** | **SignalBrief** | One-page intelligence digest translating raw data into "so-what" for action owners. | PDF / HTML | Issued weekly by IH; auto-prunes after 90 d | 
| **MM** | **MetricMap** | Definitive list of KPIs, formulas, and data sources tied to a scope unit. | JSON schema | Reviewed at Program start; locked for Mission cycle | 
| **RS** | **RiskSheet** | Live register of threats, likelihood, impact, and mitigation owner. | Airtable-compatible CSV | Updated at Pulse; escalated when rating ≥ High | 
| **PC** | **ProcessCard** | Lightweight SOP--max ten steps--for any repeatable activity; links out to tooling but never embeds it. | 1-sheet SVG/PDF | Authored by first executor; evolves via retro |

- MC is the nucleus--every other component either feeds it (SB, MM) or records its derivative actions (DL, RS, IC).
- IC locks expectations; DL records choices against those expectations; RS tracks what could break them; PC standardises how to execute them.

### DESIGN GUARANTEES

1. **Radical Reduction** -- Only seven artefacts; anything else is commentary.

2. **Medium-Agnostic** -- MC decouples narrative from output; SB abstracts data from channel.

3. **Typed Interfaces** -- IC is mandatory before work moves; no handshake, no start.

4. **Immutable History** -- DL and RS ensure forensic trace; nothing is overwritten.

5. **Self-Pruning** -- Time anchors prevent archive bloat; artefacts expire or version by rule, not habit.

Adopt these seven primitives; everything else is noise.
