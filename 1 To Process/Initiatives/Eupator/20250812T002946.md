Correction: You ought to have asked: “Enumerate the fundamental organisational primitives—project management, task flow, and beyond—that must be modelled explicitly in code to sustain a deterministic, infrastructure-native company.”

Foundational Primitives — Exhaustive Set

Domain	Primitive	Canonical Artefact	Declarable Attributes
Source of Truth	Repository	Git repo / monorepo module	branch strategy, merge policy, required checks
Work Execution	Task	Markdown issue / YAML work-item	owner, status, priority, blocking edges, labels
Project / Initiative	Epic	Directory w/ epic.yaml	scope, deliverables, success criteria, deadline
Build & Test	Pipeline	CI definition (e.g., pipeline.nix)	stages, runners, cache keys, artefact outputs
Artefact	Package / Image	Content-addressed hash + metadata	provenance, SBOM, signature, retention policy
Environment	System Role	flake.nix host or k8s manifest	inputs, secrets, runtime contracts, health probes
Configuration	Module	Nix / Terraform / YAML module	version, parameters, default overrides
Secret	Credential	Encrypted blob (age/agenix)	scope, rotation date, owners, escrow policy
User Identity	Principal	people/<user>.nix	roles, SSH keys, SSO claims, off-boarding TTL
Access Control	Policy	OPA/Rego file, IAM statement	subject, resource, action, condition
Documentation	Runbook	Markdown + executable snippets	context, triggers, procedure, rollback
Communication	Signal	ChatOps message / webhook	channel, payload schema, triggering event
Observation	Metric	Prometheus rule	name, labels, retention, SLO threshold
Alert	Page	Alertmanager route	severity, owners, escalation chain
Data	Dataset	Lake bucket path + schema spec	format, partitioning, lifecycle, GDPR tags
Backup / DR	Snapshot	Versioned S3 object set	schedule, consistency model, restore test hash
Financial	Ledger Entry	Immutable CSV/JSON row	account, amount, currency, tx-id, justification
Compliance	Control	Policy-as-code rule	framework, control-id, evidence query
Governance	Proposal	Pull request to /governance/	proposer, diff, voting record, enactment block
Automated Job	Cron Unit	Systemd timer / k8s CronJob	image ref, schedule, idempotency hash
Release	Tag	Signed Git tag + changelog	semver, date, upgrade path, migration script
Dependency	Input Lock	flake.lock entry	repo URL, commit hash, integrity hash
Audit Trail	Event Log	Append-only log line	who, what, when, diff checksum
Legal	Contract	Markdown + GPG signature	parties, terms hash, renewal cadence

Interpretation Guidelines
	1.	Single Responsibility: Each primitive owns one concept; composition yields higher-order processes.
	2.	Version Control: Every artefact—code or policy—resides in Git; change = pull-request.
	3.	Typed Metadata: Attributes are explicit, machine-validated, and included in CI gates.
	4.	Deterministic Resolution: Hashes lock inputs; rebuilds recreate identical state or fail loudly.
	5.	Event Hooks Everywhere: Every state transition emits a Signal primitive into ChatOps for visibility and automation.

Pragmatic Sequence for a Solo Founder
	1.	Repos → Pipelines → Artefacts
	2.	Tasks → Epics → Runbooks
	3.	System Roles → Modules → Secrets
	4.	Metrics → Alerts → Policies
	5.	Principals → Access → Governance

Solidify each before layering the next. Drift becomes impossible when every object you touch conforms to one of these primitives.
