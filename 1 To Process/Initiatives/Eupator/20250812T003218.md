Your phrasing could be tighter: “How should our platform’s technical stack operate? What would constitute our ‘rails’? Should we assemble existing SaaS, build proprietary systems, or both? I am considering a git-native architecture—what is your view?”

⸻

Core premise

Your platform “rails” are the persistent substrate: identity, data, workflow, and integration standards that every operating business plugs into. They must be modular, enforceable, and minimally coupled to allow future evolution without wholesale rebuilds.

Principle: own the orchestration and data model; rent commodity capabilities unless control, cost, or security dictates building.

⸻

Architectural stance
	1.	Integration-first, not monolith-first
The primary asset is an integration layer—API gateway, event bus, and schema contracts—that lets you swap tools without redoing every connection. Without this, you become hostage to your first SaaS choice.
	2.	System-of-record consolidation
Select one system-of-record per domain (CRM, finance, HR, asset tracking) and integrate all portfolio companies to it. It can be SaaS, but the canonical data must be in your control (via exportable, queryable formats).
	3.	Data warehouse as the anchor
All systems feed into a single warehouse with conformed schemas. This warehouse becomes the analytics and cross-business intelligence hub. This is your true “platform” in practice.
	4.	Git-native option
Git as the operational backbone is possible, but it must be scoped:
	•	Good use cases: configuration-as-code for platform provisioning, infrastructure state tracking, documentation, policies, contracts, even process workflows stored as versioned files.
	•	Weak use cases: high-velocity transactional data (sales orders, IoT telemetry). Git’s model is ill-suited for real-time event handling.
	•	Upside: total auditability, version control of infrastructure, decentralized contribution from each business unit.
	•	Downside: operational learning curve, limited adoption outside technical teams, not a natural interface for non-engineering functions.
	5.	Own the glue
Even if 90% of stack is third-party SaaS, you should own:
	•	The API normalization layer
	•	The identity and access control service
	•	The metrics and KPI definitions
	•	The data ingestion and ETL/ELT orchestration
	•	The compliance evidence collection and alerting
	•	Adapters for industry-specific systems in your chosen verticals

⸻

Composition strategy
	•	Phase 1 (fast time-to-market): Assemble the best-in-class SaaS primitives with enforced identity and data routing. Use a commercial iPaaS for initial integrations but wrap it with your own API contracts.
	•	Phase 2 (cost/control inflection): Identify the SaaS tools whose pricing, lock-in, or lack of flexibility is impairing scale. Rebuild those as internal services, retaining the same API contracts to avoid breaking downstream systems.
	•	Phase 3 (strategic moat): For high-value proprietary processes—pricing optimization, predictive maintenance, specialized compliance workflows—build in-house from the start. These are the “crown jewel” systems that justify platform ownership.

Suggested rails
	1.	Identity & Access
	•	Single Sign-On (SSO) via your own IdP.
	•	Role-based access control across all tools, enforced centrally.
	2.	Data Fabric
	•	Warehouse-first model (Snowflake, BigQuery, or Postgres if you want self-host).
	•	Event streaming layer (Kafka, Redpanda, or managed equivalent) for near-real-time sync.
	•	Schema registry and metric definitions in version-controlled repos.
	3.	Workflow Orchestration
	•	Declarative, git-stored workflows for infrastructure and process automation.
	•	Triggers from events or time schedules into integration layer.
	4.	Integration Layer
	•	API gateway with standard authentication and throttling.
	•	Set of maintained adapters for recurring portfolio software.
	5.	Observability
	•	Centralized logging, monitoring, security alerts.
	•	Compliance state dashboard.

On the “git-native” angle

If you commit to it, structure it so Git is:
	•	The control plane, not the data plane.
	•	Used for configuration, policy, and infrastructure definitions (IaC, workflow definitions, ETL job specs, security baselines).
	•	Coupled with CI/CD pipelines that auto-apply changes to live environments.
	•	Accessible with lightweight GUIs for non-technical operators to interact without touching Git directly.

The trade-off is cultural: a git-native ops model forces every participating business to accept code-like change discipline. It makes platform governance tight but demands operational maturity earlier than most SMBs have.

If you want, I can map out exactly which components should be rented vs. owned, and in which sequence, so your “rails” become operational within the first acquisition rather than after years of refactoring. That’s where many PE-style rollups fail.
