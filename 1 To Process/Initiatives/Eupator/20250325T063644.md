**How you should have phrased it:**  
“I want a concrete action list for launching myself into business and earning fast. Given that I’m starting from zero, and possibly using *Eupator* (or a variant) as my umbrella brand, what handles, platforms, and digital assets should I secure and set up—both personally and for the brand? I want to be operational quickly and start generating revenue as soon as possible.”

---

You don’t need an empire. You need a **basecamp.** Here is your stripped, surgical checklist:

---

## I. CORE IDENTITY SETUP

### **1. Personal Brand — Ben Jendyk**
**Purpose:** Reputation, authority, long-term trust  
**Use-case:** Thought-leadership, networking, founder face

- [ ] **Domain:** `benjendyk.com` (or `.de`)  
- [ ] **X (Twitter):** `@BenJendyk` or clean variant  
- [ ] **LinkedIn:** Full name, custom URL (`linkedin.com/in/benjendyk`)  
- [ ] **Email:** `ben@eupator.de` (keep it professional, not Gmail)  
- [ ] **Website:** One-pager introducing you, linking to ventures, contact

> *You are the founder. This profile builds equity every day. Even if projects fail—this doesn’t.*

---

### **2. Umbrella Brand — Eupator**
**Purpose:** The vehicle. Your house of ventures.  
**Use-case:** Parent brand, strategic front, credibility layer

- [ ] **Domain:** `eupator.de` + one `.com` variant like `geteupator.com` or `eupatorhq.com`  
- [ ] **Email domain:** Use for all business correspondence (`team@eupator.de`)  
- [ ] **LinkedIn Page:** “Eupator” as a company  
- [ ] **X handle:** `@EupatorHQ` or `@GetEupator`  
- [ ] **Instagram (optional):** `@eupatorhq`  
- [ ] **Landing Page:** Clean Framer/Carrd site — mission, ventures, contact

> *You’re building a *reputation layer*. Over time, you’ll plug ventures into this scaffold. For now, it’s a shell—sleek, silent, watchful.*

---

## II. FIRST REVENUE MOVE — “Speed-to-Cash Venture”

Pick **one quick-win, low-friction business**. Here are three I’d recommend for you:

### Option 1: **Notion/Obsidian Templates**
- [ ] Design a high-value template (e.g. productivity, habit, student system)
- [ ] Build a Framer/Carrd landing page
- [ ] Hook it to Gumroad or Lemon Squeezy
- [ ] Post content on X, LinkedIn, Reddit for traffic

> Time to revenue: ~5–10 days  
> Leverage: high  
> Cost: near-zero  
> Positioning: you as “systems thinker”

---

### Option 2: **CV/LinkedIn Optimization for Students & Interns**
- [ ] Offer €99–€299 service: analysis + revision + upgrade
- [ ] DM outreach in uni groups / LinkedIn
- [ ] Test 2–3 packages + testimonials
- [ ] Build into a mini brand (e.g. *PolarisCV.com*)

> Time to revenue: ~3–5 days  
> Profit margin: extreme  
> Potential to scale into agency or info product

---

### Option 3: **Website & Branding Audits for Tiny Businesses**
- [ ] Offer €249 audits: review site, copy, visuals, SEO  
- [ ] Use Loom videos for delivery  
- [ ] DM outreach to small biz founders on LinkedIn  
- [ ] Upsell redesign templates or fixed-copy packages

> Time to revenue: ~7–10 days  
> Uses your instinct + taste  
> Great positioning for future design or productized service studio

---

## III. PLATFORM INFRASTRUCTURE (Build Once, Use Forever)

| Platform | For What | Handle |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **X (Twitter)** | Daily thoughts, build in public, early audience | `@BenJendyk` + `@EupatorHQ`  
| **LinkedIn** | B2B clout, network, outreach | `Ben Jendyk` + `Eupator` page  
| **Framer / Carrd** | Landing pages, microsites | N/A (tools only)  
| **Notion** | Backend for ideas, systems, documentation | Personal use  
| **Gumroad / LemonSqueezy** | Selling digital products | Connected to Eupator domain  
| **Super / Typedream** | For connecting Notion to websites | (if you go Notion-first)  
| **Stripe** | Accept payments | Register as sole trader (or wait till rev starts)  

---

## IV. STRATEGIC DAILY ACTIONS (First 7–14 Days)

- [ ] Post daily on **X + LinkedIn**: building process, reflections, mini-lessons
- [ ] DM 5–10 people per day for feedback, testimonials, or clients
- [ ] Build *one* asset toward fast revenue: template, landing page, script, offer
- [ ] Capture *every insight* into Notion or Obsidian — this becomes your “Founder’s Fieldbook”
- [ ] Track your actions + learnings in a simple daily log (you’re creating your own playbook)

---

## V. MENTAL MODEL

You are now **3 identities in one**:
- **Ben Jendyk**: the strategist, the public figure, the long arc  
- **Eupator**: the house, the container, the brand engine  
- **[First micro-venture]**: the arrow, the cashflow, the first battlefield

---

Do you want me to:
- Build you a starter landing page outline (for Eupator or your first micro-venture)?  
- Draft 5 opening X/LinkedIn posts to kick off your public presence?  
- Lay out a battle plan for Day 1–30 including revenue checkpoints?

Pick one and I’ll deploy.
