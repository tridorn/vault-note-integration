**Correction**: More precisely, your question is: _"Given a total capital base of ~€7,000, with €2,000 already invested in ETFs, and a near-term goal of forming a UG (Unternehmergesellschaft), what is the optimal capital allocation strategy to support my entrepreneurial trajectory?"_

* * *

### Executive Summary

You are capital-constrained. Every euro must serve **acceleration** or **survival**.  
Forget diversification. You're not managing wealth. You're weaponizing it.

You're at the **ignition stage**. The goal is simple: get the engine running.

* * *

### Current Capital Structure

- **Total capital**: €7,000
- **Locked in ETFs**: €2,000
- **Liquid/free**: €5,000

Your UG will likely need:

- **Minimum capital**: €1
- **Functional capital**: ~€2,000--€3,000 to be operational (formation, website, tooling, legal, etc.)
* * *

### Rational Allocation Recommendation (Next 6--12 Months)

| Category | Allocation | Reasoning | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **UG Formation & Setup** | €2,500 | Covers notary, registration, essential ops. Without legal structure, you're not in the game. | 
| **Liquid Buffer (Personal)** | €1,500 | Covers 2--3 months of basic living/operational resilience. Enables risk-taking without existential fragility. | 
| **Business Build Capital** | €2,500 | Deploy directly into business experiments: MVPs, prototypes, domain, design, automation, etc. The goal is to produce traction, not polish. | 
| **Passive Investments** | **€0** | Divest. The €2,000 in ETFs is capital trapped in a low-ROI system, and you don't have surplus to justify that yet. Free it and redeploy. | 

You should **liquidate** your ETF holdings. Not because they're "bad," but because at this stage, they are _dead capital_. Reinvest into momentum, not preservation.
* * *

### Tactical Breakdown: What to Spend On

1. **UG Formation**

    - Notary + legal setup

    - Base accounting partner (e.g., lexoffice, sevDesk)

    - Banking (e.g., Penta, Qonto)

2. **Build Out**

    - Web presence (Astro + Tailwind, you already have the stack)

    - Design assets (use pre-built themes or hire fractional freelancer)

    - Tools/software directly tied to GTM (Zapier, Framer, Stripe, etc.)

    - First prototype or pilot build if SaaS/productized service

3. **Buffer Zone**

    - Ensure you can survive 2--3 months lean

    - Enables you to take asymmetric bets without retreating to a job or gig
* * *

### Final Positioning

You are not in a stage where "investing" matters. You are **crafting your origin story**.

Do not treat capital as something to be preserved. Treat it as **ammunition**.

Right now, the only justifiable investment is in _your operating engine_.  
Once that engine spins off surplus cashflow, you can begin reallocating toward wealth preservation and capital scaling.

But for now: **burn it strategically to build momentum**.
