You are not building a service agency--you are building a **cash-yielding operations layer** that trains your systems, finances your growth, and produces internal assets. The cadence must reflect that: fast-turnaround, fixed-scope, high-margin projects with short collection cycles and built-in templates for reuse.
* * *

## I. Baseline Cadence: WebOps + VisualOps Pilot Period (Months 1--3)

| Metric | WebOps | VisualOps | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Average project size** | €1 200--1 800 | €1 500--2 500 | 
| **Delivery time** | 5--10 working days | 7--14 working days | 
| **Freelancer cost** | €300--500 | €400--600 | 
| **Your margin** | 60--75 % | 65--80 % | 
| **Capacity (solo PM)** | 2--3 projects per week | 1--2 projects per week | 
| **Collection cycle** | 50 % up front, 50 % on handover | same | 

> Target: **6--10 projects/month total**, yielding **€8--15k revenue** with **€4--10k gross margin**
* * *

## II. Scaling Curve (Solo to System)

### **Phase 1 (Months 1--2): Manual Control**

- You do all sales, project management, QA
- Freelancers handle execution
- Focus on speed, feedback, asset collection

**Revenue goal:** €6--8k/month  
**Time commitment:** ~25--30 hrs/week  
**Output:** 2--3 case studies, repeatable briefing docs, component library
* * *

### **Phase 2 (Month 3--4): Assist + Systemise**
- Hire virtual assistant or part-time PM to handle intake, prep, and QA
- Create 1-click client intake form (Typeform + Notion sync)
- Create delivery SOPs and train a delivery loop (brief > build > review > deliver)

**Revenue goal:** €10--15k/month  
**Your role:** Quality control, client acquisition  
**Output:** 1--2 Ops units formalised with delivery rhythm, internal dashboard
* * *

### **Phase 3 (Month 5--6): Fork Internal Demand**

- Use spare capacity to launch Tier 2 ventures (e.g., ComplyKit, MetricLens)
- Internal clients follow same cadence, just shift accounting internally
- Begin isolating units with own P&L and brand if proven stable

**Revenue goal:** €15--20k/month total across client + internal demand  
**Team structure:** You + 1 VA + 3--4 freelancers (project basis)
* * *

## III. Cadence Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Project = Sprint** | No multi-month retainers. 7--10 day build windows. Clear entry/exit points. | 
| **Fixed scope = fixed margin** | Pre-priced packages: 1-pager site, startup brand kit, video explainer | 
| **No "maybe" clients** | Intake filter: do they have money, urgency, and clarity? Else, reject | 
| **No rolling deadlines** | Each week has 2--3 delivery slots. Scarcity forces decision speed | 
| **Cash discipline** | 50 % deposits before work starts. 3-day handover review. Balance due at delivery | 
* * *

## IV. Rule-of-Thumb Projections

| Capacity | Monthly Projects | Gross Revenue | Gross Margin | Notes | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Solo Operator | 6--10 | €8--12k | ~€5--8k | Max before burnout | 
| Lightly Systemised | 12--16 | €15--20k | ~€10--14k | Requires VA + delivery pool | 
| Fully Modularised | 20+ | €25--40k | ~€18--30k | Unit economics proven, hire PMs | 
* * *

### Scaling = Mastery × Margin × Repeatability

Your real lever is not volume--it's **reusability**. Each project creates:

- Templates (site, brand, dossier)
- Prompts (GPT chains, Claude workflows)
- Structures (briefs, delivery forms)
- Trust (testimonials, case studies)

The _cadence_ is not just about cash--it trains your system to absorb complexity and turn it into replicable machinery.

Begin with 6--8 projects/month. Keep delivery tight. Cut anything that introduces noise. Once cadence stabilises, scale only through structure.
