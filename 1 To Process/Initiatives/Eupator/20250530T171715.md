Understood. I will assume the role of your **strategic corporate counsel**—prioritising sovereignty, capital efficiency, and future flexibility. This is **not a theoretical overview**, but a set of **explicit, recommended decisions** to set up **Eupator UG** correctly in your context.

---

## I. Legal Form & Structure

### ✅ **Recommendation:**

**Eupator UG (haftungsbeschränkt)** — single-shareholder
→ Convert to **GmbH** only once retained earnings exceed €25k

### Rationale:

* **Limited liability** protects personal assets
* **Low capital barrier** (you can start at €1–€2k)
* **Functionally identical to GmbH** in tax and contract law
* **Easier to scale up than undo errors** made in early GmbH complexity

---

## II. Holding Structure

### ⚠️ **Do *not* add a holding UG now.**

You should **not create a two-tier structure (Holding UG → Operating UG)** *yet*, because:

* You have no active ventures, assets, or cashflows requiring legal separation
* You’ll incur **double accounting, double tax filings**
* Holding makes sense when:

  * You anticipate profit distribution
  * You want to reinvest earnings from multiple UGs into new projects
  * You want to sell operating units later tax-optimized

### ✅ **Defer Holding UG** until:

* Operating profits ≥ €50–100k/year
* You want to extract dividends (Holding UG → you personally)
* You want to split risk-bearing entities

---

## III. Share Capital & Capitalisation

### ✅ **Set starting capital at €1 000**

* **Avoid symbolic €1**: flagged by banks and partners as unserious
* €1 000 keeps capital locked (Stammkapital stays in company account)
* Can be used to pay initial costs: website, design, SaaS, contractor fees
* No need to fully deposit if using Musterprotokoll with single founder (partial is enough to register)

**Deposit timing**: Immediately after notary appointment
**Bank**: Use Qonto, Penta, or Deutsche Bank if you want traditional lender later

---

## IV. Registration & Governance Setup

### ✅ Use **Musterprotokoll** if:

* Single shareholder
* No co-founder, investor, or multi-tier voting logic needed
* No deviations on director liability clauses or profit distribution

> **Otherwise**, request custom Satzung from notary

### Must-haves:

* Geschäftsadresse (can be home, or virtual office for \~€20–30/month)
* Ausweiskopie
* Notarvertrag (beurkundet)
* Gesellschafterbeschluss if bringing others in later

---

## V. Trademark & IP

### ✅ Register **word mark** “Eupator” at **DPMA** *(Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt)*

| Step                                          | Detail                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class selection**                           | Use **Nizza-Klassen 35, 41, 42**                      |
| (Advertising, Education, Technology/Software) |                                                       |
| **Cost**                                      | €290 (online), covers 3 classes                       |
| **Timing**                                    | Do after UG name is approved by HRB (Handelsregister) |
| **Risk**                                      | Use TMView + DPMAregister search for conflicts        |

**Don’t wait until someone else squats the name**—do it post-UG, pre-launch.

## VI. Other Legal Infrastructure

| Item                   | Action                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Impressum & DSGVO**  | Generate via e-Recht24 + host on site footer                                     |
| **Invoicing**          | Use lexoffice, sevDesk or FastBill (legal invoice format)                        |
| **Accounting**         | Steuerberater not needed until complexity rises; use tax tools with DATEV export |
| **Contract Templates** |                                                                                  |

* NDA (Mutual)
* Freelancer agreement (Werkvertrag, not employment)
* Standard project terms (AGB)
  → Use Legalvisio or smartlaw\.de |

## VII. Fiscal Considerations

| Tax ID     | You’ll receive **Steuernummer** from Finanzamt after HRB registration (takes 1–2 weeks) |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VAT        | Apply for **USt-IdNr.** early (needed for EU cross-border invoicing)                    |
| Accounting | Cash-based (EÜR) for simplicity, unless revenue > €600k/year                            |
| Banking    | Open account in UG name (requires notarised founding docs + HRB #)                      |

## VIII. Strategic Setup Choices — Recap

| Decision         | Recommendation                            | Rationale                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Legal form       | UG haftungsbeschränkt                     | Lean entry, upgrade to GmbH later        |
| Capital          | €1 000                                    | Serious enough, keeps burn minimal       |
| Holding UG       | Defer                                     | Adds friction without leverage right now |
| Brand            | Register “Eupator” (word mark, 3 classes) | Prevents future IP conflicts             |
| Governance       | Single-founder with Musterprotokoll       | Low-cost, low-friction launch            |
| Tax model        | EÜR (cash-based) + USt-IdNr.              | Maximises liquidity, VAT reclaim         |
| IP & contracts   | Self-hosted templates + AGB               | Professional optics, legal cover         |
| Accounting infra | Lexoffice or sevDesk                      | DATEV-ready, accountant optional         |
