Alright -- here's a hybrid plan that balances highest odds of building a valuable company fast with your long-term goal of being a city-transformer.

  

Think of it as Two Campaigns in One War:

- Phase A: Build your "company engine" in the best growth environment possible.
- Phase B: Use the capital, influence, and network from Phase A to choose and reshape your own "hub city" -- Trieste or another target.
* * *

## Phase A -- Build the Company Engine Where Odds Are Highest (Years 0--7)

  

Step 1 -- Start in Mannheim/Frankfurt (Years 0--2)
- Costs low, you know the culture, and you can tap both Frankfurt's finance ecosystem and Heidelberg/Karlsruhe tech talent.
- Begin the company as a venture platform:

    - Shared services (legal, accounting, marketing, logistics, software dev) for startups you incubate.

    - Take minority equity in every venture you launch/support.

    - Focus on scalable, low-CAPEX ventures first (SaaS, marketplaces, logistics-tech, digital services).

  

Step 2 -- Relocate HQ to a Global Growth Hub (Years 2--3)
- Criteria: ease of doing business, access to global capital, and founder-friendly regulation.
- Best fits for you: Singapore or Dubai.

    - Both are global logistics/trade hubs (good fit for your empire-building brain).

    - Strong government support for startups/innovation.

    - Tax efficiency.
- Keep German subsidiary for EU market credibility.

  

Step 3 -- Scale Internationally (Years 3--7)
- Aggressively recruit talent from multiple countries into your platform.
- Expand into fast-growth sectors:

    - Digital supply chain solutions.

    - Trade financing platforms.

    - Niche manufacturing with just-in-time delivery.
- Build cash flow stability with a mix of high-margin digital ventures and steady B2B services.
- Aim for €5--10M yearly gross revenue and diversified equity in 8--15 ventures by Year 7.

## Phase B -- Become a City-Builder (Years 8--20)

  

Step 4 -- Choose the City to Transform (Year 7--8)
- Now you have capital, credibility, and a portfolio of operating ventures.
- Pick a location where:

    - The local government will actively court you.

    - There's untapped infrastructure potential (port, airport, rail).

    - The city can be branded around your company's industry.
- Candidates:

    - Trieste, Italy -- gateway between Central Europe and global trade, underdeveloped for its potential.

    - Walvis Bay, Namibia -- strategic Atlantic/Southern Africa port.

    - Da Nang, Vietnam -- midpoint hub with port + airport + young workforce.

  

Step 5 -- Anchor with a Signature HQ/Hub
- Buy or co-develop a major building or complex -- make it the symbol of your arrival.
- Base your own HQ there and house an accelerator/incubator for local entrepreneurs.

  

Step 6 -- Shape the Local Economy (Years 8--15)
- Deploy your ventures locally to solve big bottlenecks -- logistics, manufacturing, tech infrastructure.
- Build partnerships with local universities to funnel talent into your companies.
- Position the city as the natural HQ for your industry in the region.

  

Step 7 -- Lock in Long-Term Influence (Years 15--20)
- Create public--private projects that bind the city's growth to your company (ports, industrial parks, startup districts).
- Host annual high-profile conferences to bring global investors to your city.
- By now, your company's story is the city's story -- your legacy is baked in.

## Why This Hybrid Works

- You get the odds → You start in the environment where company growth is fastest (Singapore/Dubai after your Mannheim/Frankfurt launch).
- You get the legacy → You only move into city-building when you have the leverage to actually change a place, rather than fighting uphill from day one.
- You stay flexible → If Trieste proves less strategic by Year 7--8, you can pick another "hub city" without derailing your company's trajectory.

If you want, I can map a year-by-year personal action plan for Phase A so you know exactly what to do from now until you're ready to pick your city in Year 7--8.

That would give you a clear runway from student in Mannheim → global founder → city-builder.
