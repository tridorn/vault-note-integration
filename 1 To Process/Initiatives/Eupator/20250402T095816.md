You should have said:  
**“What do I actually need to build—technically and practically—to launch the maps publicly and start promoting them around my university and local startup scene? How much tech stack is required, and how can I keep it simple but clean?”**

---

You want to move fast, make it usable, and not be bottlenecked by dev work.

Here’s the **technical setup roadmap**, built for your current stage and intention: publish Maps, promote them locally, and gather real feedback.

---

## **I. Objectives of the Setup**

You need a system that allows you to:

1. **Display Maps in a structured and beautiful way** (not just blog posts)
2. **Link or QR to each Map directly**
3. **Allow others to view, print, download, or embed**
4. **Possibly let others fork or suggest improvements later**
5. **Be manageable by *you*—without needing a dev every time**

---

## **II. Recommended Stack (Phase 1: Launch-Ready)**

| Component              | Tool / Stack                        | Why Use It                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend Website**    | Astro + Tailwind (you already use it) | Clean, fast, custom UI. You control design and structure.    |
| **CMS (Content System)**| Markdown files in GitHub or Notion CMS | Easiest to start—editable by you. Can scale later.           |
| **Hosting**             | Vercel or Netlify                    | Free, simple, instant deployment of static Astro site.       |
| **PDF Export**          | md-to-pdf CLI tool or Puppeteer      | For downloadable, printable maps                            |
| **QR Code Generator**   | qr-code-generator.com or CLI tools   | One code per map → links to public page or PDF              |
| **Analytics**           | Plausible or Umami                   | Light privacy-focused analytics to see what gets visited     |

---

### **Folder Structure Example (if using Astro + Markdown)**

```
/maps
   ├── startup-onboarding.md
   ├── client-handovers.md
   ├── weekly-review.md
```

Each file contains frontmatter (YAML) + structured content:

```markdown
---
title: "Weekly Operations Review"
tags: ["ops", "review", "team"]
role: "Team Lead"
version: "1.0"
updated: "2025-04-02"
download: "/pdf/weekly-ops-review.pdf"
---

## Use Case
A repeatable weekly cadence to review goals, blockers, and performance.

## Inputs
- Weekly metrics
- Action item list

## Steps
1. Open meeting agenda template.
2. Start with metrics.
3. Review previous week's action items.
4. Identify blockers.
5. Assign new tasks.
```

Astro will render this into a clean map card/page.

---

## **III. Simple Feature Add-Ons (No-Code or Low-Code)**

### **1. QR Codes per Map**
- Use free QR tools (or CLI like `qrcode-terminal`)  
- Link to either:
  - Web version of the map (`/maps/client-handovers`)
  - Direct PDF download (`/pdf/client-handovers-v1.pdf`)

Print it with:
- Title
- Short description
- Version number
- QR code

### **2. Print/PDF Button**
Use a “Print this map” button on each map page:
```html
<button onclick="window.print()">Print this Map</button>
```
Or generate PDFs beforehand and link them with a download button:
```html
<a href="/pdf/client-handovers.pdf">Download PDF</a>
```

### **3. Contact / Feedback Form**
- Simple embedded Tally.so or Google Form
- Ask:
  - “Was this map useful?”
  - “Any steps unclear?”
  - “What would you add?”
- Or use a widget like `FeedbackFish` or `CommentBox`.

## **IV. What You Need to Prepare**

| Task                        | Tool or Output                         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Map content                 | Markdown files (or Notion docs)        |
| Astro + Tailwind site setup | Base layout + map directory            |
| Hosting account             | Netlify or Vercel                      |
| QR code for each map        | Free tool (QR generator)               |
| Printable posters/cards     | Canva or Figma + exported PDFs         |
| Feedback form               | Tally.so / Google Form / FeedbackFish  |

---

## **V. Example Rollout Timeline (10–14 Days)**

| Day | Action                                  |
|-----|------------------------------------------|
| 1–2 | Write 3–5 core maps (in Markdown or Notion)  
| 3–5 | Build Astro layout (or adapt an existing site)  
| 5–6 | Deploy site to Vercel or Netlify  
| 7   | Create QR codes and link them to map pages  
| 8–9 | Design posters/cards with QR & short titles  
| 10  | Set up feedback form + embed into map pages  
| 11–14 | Start local promotion: workshops, posters, Slack links

---

## **VI. Minimal Viable Stack (If You Want No Code at All)**

If you *really* want to skip code:

- **Use Notion** for all maps  
- Create a **public Notion site** (via Super.so or Potion.so)  
- Use Notion templates for maps  
- Create **QR codes that link to Notion pages or PDFs**  
- Share as “Map of the Week” in newsletters or print posters

**Downside:** Less custom styling, less ownership long-term.  
**Upside:** Zero dev needed. Launch tomorrow.

---

## **VII. Final Recommendation**

You already use Astro. So:

- Stick with Astro + Tailwind + Markdown  
- Start small: 3–5 maps, clean design, QR printable  
- Add PDF/Print/export + a feedback form  
- Print physical posters for local groups and embed in Slack/Notion for startups

Once this is in place, you're ready to **walk into student meetings or startups with a physical SOP card and a link that works.**

If you'd like, I’ll:
- Design a sample Astro map page template  
- Write a sample map in Markdown  
- Mock up a printable A4 map poster with QR  
- Draft the copy for your site’s “Map Library” front page
