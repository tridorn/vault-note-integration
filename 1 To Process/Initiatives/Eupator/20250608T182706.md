More precisely: _"Provide a step-by-step sequence for building the legal and operational structure in the early stages, leading up to the future architecture we've defined, but without prematurely incorporating elements meant only for IPO-scale. Focus on the first practical moves."_

* * *

## EARLY-STAGE SETUP: STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT

_Target context: 1--24 months, €0--500k revenue, no institutional investors yet._

* * *

### **Step 1 -- Formation of German UG** _(done or in progress)_
- **Entity**: `Eupator UG (haftungsbeschränkt)`
- **Purpose**: Revenue capture, initial execution, employee onboarding.
- **You**: Sole shareholder, sole director.

**Actions**:

- Register UG in Germany with €500--1,000 capital.
- Assign all IP you create now to the UG (license back to yourself if needed).
- Draft clean founder agreement with IP assignment + future transfer clause.
- Begin generating first revenue via consulting, Ops Units (WebOps, VisualOps).
* * *

### **Step 2 -- Incorporate Austrian GmbH** _(~€20--50k cash-on-hand, or when building team outside Germany)_
- **Entity**: `Eupator GmbH (Austria)`
- **Purpose**: Long-term operational HQ and hiring base.
- **Shareholder**: You (personally).
- **Office**: Coworking address in Vienna (e.g. Talent Garden, Impact Hub).

**Actions**:

- Pay in €17.5k (min capital for GmbH).
- No staff needed yet, but set up bank account and accounting.
- Keep dormant until Austrian hiring or strategic move.

**Rationale**:  
Sets the future HQ base early, but avoids premature commitment. Allows grant eligibility and EU-wide hiring later.

* * *

### **Step 3 -- Incorporate UK Ltd** _(Optional but smart if optics or early international work needed)_
- **Entity**: `Eupator Ltd (UK)`
- **Purpose**: External optics, cross-border contracting, future investor interface.
- **Shareholder**: You (or UG).
- **Office**: Use a prestige virtual address (e.g. Fitzrovia, Notting Hill, Mayfair).

**Actions**:

- Minimal share capital (£1).
- Keep operationally dormant, activate only when used for outbound contracts or PR.
* * *

### **Step 4 -- Set up Personal Operating Protocols**

**You personally:**

- Registered in Germany → employed via the UG, possibly as managing director.
- Avoid drawing a salary initially. Take reimbursements or minimal payment if needed.
- Document your role as founder: strategic direction, IP creation, project oversight.
* * *

### **Step 5 -- Structure for Clean Future Transfer**

Prepare documents now for later transfer of ownership, but don't execute yet.

**Draft and store (not file):**

- IP assignment agreements from UG to future Austrian GmbH or Swiss AG.
- Share transfer agreements (UG → future AG or Holding).
- Internal valuation memos (can be informal) for future tax-proofing.
* * *

### **Step 6 -- Design Control Doctrine (Privately)**

Start drafting core governance doctrines _off-ledger_, to be encoded into the Swiss Stiftung and AG later:

- Charter of House Eupator (vision, veto logic, control hierarchy).
- Foundation protector protocols (how you'll maintain invisible authority).
- Golden share mechanics (how the Stiftung will anchor final control).

This costs nothing but becomes the spine of your later legal architecture.

* * *

### **Step 7 -- Register IP Ownership via GmbH or Reserve Vehicle** _(Optional but prudent if you build valuable IP)_

If you anticipate creating valuable code, trademarks, or content soon:

- Move those assets from UG to Austrian GmbH via a licensing agreement.
- Charge a nominal annual license fee (low enough not to trigger tax scrutiny).
- Alternatively: establish a dormant _Eupator IP GmbH_ as an internal firewall.

## Clean Summary of Early Entities

| Entity | Formed? | Function | Status | Shareholder | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Eupator UG (DE) | Yes | Early ops + execution | Active | You | 
| Eupator GmbH (AT) | Soon | Strategic HQ + hiring | Dormant/prep | You | 
| Eupator Ltd (UK) | Optional | Optics / investor shell | Dormant | You or UG | 

* * *

## Cost Estimate (Ballpark, early stage)

| Item | Cost (EUR) | 
| ---- | ----  |
| UG formation | 500--1,000 | 
| GmbH Austria registration | 17,500 min. cap | 
| UK Ltd (virtual setup) | ~200--300 | 
| Lawyer for IP assignments | ~1,500 one-off | 
| Bookkeeping (DE+AT+UK) | ~250--600/month | 

* * *

### Final Strategic Advice

> Do not form the **Swiss Stiftung** or **Swiss AG** yet.  
They are **control constructs**, not operational necessities. You only form them when there is:

- IP worth shielding
- Equity worth preserving
- Revenue worth extracting
- External risk worth firewalling

For now: build inside the UG, use the Austrian GmbH as your forward staging ground, and leave everything else as unlit scaffolding.
