### 1 Reason-for-Being

| Layer | Core Mission | Success Metric | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Startup Factory**(gGmbH) | Convert latent university research + student interest into _spin-out-ready_ projects. | ≥ 8 validated opportunities per year. | 
| **Eupator Studio**(UG/GmbH) | Transform those validated opportunities into funded, fast-moving companies you substantially own. | ≥ 2 incorporations per year, studio IRR ≥ 25 %. | 

The Factory _manufactures credible options_; the Studio _exercises the best options and drives them to market_.

### 5 Interface Protocols

| Touch-point | Mechanism | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Data Transfer** | Factory uploads sprint artifacts to secure vault; Studio has read-only until option signed. | 
| **IP Licence** | Royalty-free until Series A, then 1 % net sales cap. | 
| **Cost Sharing** | If Studio uses Factory staff post-option, it pays _cost + 15 %_ via monthly SLA invoice. | 
| **Governance** | Studio submits quarterly build report; Factory logs outcomes for grant metrics. | 
| **Fall-Back** | If Studio declines or fails to incorporate within 60 days, dossier enters open auction to external VCs. |

### 6 Role Separation

| Function | Factory Owner | Studio Owner | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Grant compliance | Grant & Compliance Officer | -- | 
| Talent scouting | University Liaison | -- | 
| Venture thesis | -- | Studio Lead | 
| Equity decisions | -- | Studio Investment Committee | 
| Public comms | Factory MD | Startup CEOs, Studio PR |

### 7 Cadence Synchronisation

| Quarter | Factory Milestone | Studio Milestone | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Q1 | Sprint Cohort A starts | Option review for Cohort --1 completes | 
| Q2 | Cohort A demo day | Build cycle for Venture 1 | 
| Q3 | Sprint Cohort B | Seed raise for Venture 1; Option review for Cohort A | 
| Q4 | Annual KPI report | New incorporation(s); Portfolio review | 

The stagger keeps both entities permanently loaded yet never bottlenecked.

### 8 Why the Split Works

_Factory_ retains grant eligibility, neutrality, and academic trust.  
_Studio_ retains equity, speed, and financial upside.  
The **option window** fuses them: clean, auditable hand-off with proprietary advantage.

Build exactly along these lines, and the system will be both grant-compliant and venture-grade from day one.
