**Startup Factory -- full structural blueprint**

### 1 Purpose

Institutionalise a **deal-sourcing and validation engine** that universities, corporates, and public funders can trust, while feeding proprietary deal flow into Eupator Studio. Its core KPI is the annual volume of _spin-out-ready_ opportunities, not their later market success (that part is the studio's job).

### 2 Legal chassis

**gGmbH** ("gemeinnützige GmbH") headquartered in Mannheim.
- Why gGmbH  
• Tax-exempt surplus; avoids "state-aid" conflicts.  
• Universities can sign ownership-free cooperation contracts without violating public-asset rules.  
• Eligible vehicle for EXIST Startup Factories (project phase 2025--30: 50 % BMWK funding, 50 % private match) ([startup-factories.de](https://startup-factories.de/en/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [BMWE](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2024/02/20240228-new-impetus-for-innovative-startups-via-startup-factories.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- Founding quota (nominal capital €25 000)  
-- 34 % University block (Mannheim, KIT, TU Darmstadt)  
-- 34 % Corporate block (BASF, SAP, Roche; €5--10 k each as cash or in-kind)  
-- 32 % Civic block (City of Mannheim via NEXT, Chamber of Commerce, etc.)

**Zero equity to Eupator** -- you sit on the supervisory board, not the cap table.

### 3 Governance

| Body | Composition | Mandate | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Supervisory Board | 3 × 3 seats (Uni / Corporate / Civic) | Budget approval, director hiring | 
| Investment & IP Committee | 1 rep per university, 1 corporate tech-transfer lead, Eupator observer | Gatekeeper for option grants, IP licence templates | 
| Audit & Compliance | City delegate + external accountant | Grant reporting, state-aid compliance | 

Board resolutions by simple majority; IP committee needs two-thirds to veto an option grant.

* * *

### 4 Funding stack (5-year)

| Source | Amount | Conditions | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **BMWK Startup Factories grant** | €8 m cap; disbursed 50 % against private match | Milestone-based; concept-phase approval Apr 2025, project phase Jan 2026--Dec 2030 ([BMWE](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2024/02/20240228-new-impetus-for-innovative-startups-via-startup-factories.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | 
| University in-kind | Lab space, tech transfer staff (valued €4 m) | Counts toward private match | 
| Corporate cash & services | €2--4 m | Mentoring, pilot access | 
| Factory membership fees (from 2027) | €50 k p.a. per new corporate | Replaces grant tail | 

Budget focus: 55 % human capital (program staff, venture architects), 25 % founder stipends & prototyping, 10 % events & marketing, 10 % overhead.

* * *

### 5 Program pipeline

**a. Scouting (ongoing)**  
-- Embedded "entrepreneurial liaison" in each partner faculty.  
-- Annual "DeepTech Discovery" roadshow across KIT, TU Darmstadt labs.

**b. Validation sprint (6 weeks)**  
-- 8--10 projects per cohort, €8 k prototype budget each.  
-- Weekly milestone reviews; kill ratio ≥ 50 %.

**c. Pre-seed preparation (4 weeks)**  
-- Surviving teams formalise IP options, draft EXIST-Transfer or GO-Bio applications.  
-- Eupator holds an **exclusive 60-day option** to lead incorporation.

Throughput target: 3 cohorts / year → ~24 projects, **8 spin-out-ready**.

* * *

### 6 IP and option mechanics

- **Standard licence** negotiated once, royalty-free until Series A, then 1 % net-sales cap.
- Factory receives no equity; keeps the licence until studio exercises the option.
- If Eupator passes, project enters an open auction to external VCs.
- All IP fees are grant-eligible, satisfying BMWK cost rules.
* * *

### 7 People & roles (steady-state headcount ≈ 12 FTE)

| Role | FTE | Core output | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Managing Director | 1 | Strategy, fundraising, reporting | 
| Venture Architects | 3 | Run sprints, coach teams | 
| Talent & University Lead | 1 | Scouting, faculty liaison | 
| Corporate Partnerships | 1 | Sponsorship, pilot contracts | 
| Grant & Compliance | 1 | BMWK documentation, budget | 
| Ops & Community | 2 | Events, facility, founder care | 
| Intern pool | 3 | Research, data, logistics | 

* * *

### 8 Success metrics (Factory-level)

| Horizon | Metric | Threshold | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Year 1 | Projects scouted | ≥ 50 | 
| Year 1 | Spin-out-ready | ≥ 4 | 
| Year 3 | External capital raised by spin-outs | ≥ €10 m | 
| Year 5 | Survival rate of spin-outs | ≥ 60 % | 
| Year 5 | Private-side funding ratio (post-grant) | ≥ 70 % | 

Failure triggers: two consecutive years below 70 % of KPI → board-mandated restructuring or merger into another Factory.

* * *

### 9 Studio interface (contractual)

| Aspect | Term | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Deal access | Studio has _Right of First Refusal_ on all validated projects. Option window 60 days. | 
| Cost recovery | Studio pays **cost + 15 %** for any Factory staff time used beyond validation sprint. | 
| Equity swap | Factory receives a 2 % carry-only pool in any Eupator opportunity fund (not in startups). | 
| Reporting | Studio provides quarterly build reports; Factory provides semi-annual KPI dashboard. | 

This keeps the Factory "clean" for public eyes while giving the studio proprietary advantages.

* * *

### 10 Launch chronology (condensed)

| Month | Action | 
| ---- | ----  |
| 0 | Draft MoUs; agree founding quota | 
| 2 | File gGmbH; open escrow account | 
| 3 | Submit EXIST-Factory concept; secure interim city funding | 
| 6 | Hire MD + first venture architect; open 500 m² pilot floor in MAFINEX | 
| 9 | Cohort #1 validation sprint | 
| 12 | First spin-out offer issued to Studio | 
| 18 | BMWK project-phase funding activated (if selected) | 
| 24 | Factory fully staffed; switch to three-cohort cadence | 

* * *

### 11 Why the universities and corporates say yes

- **Universities** trade zero-cost IP slippage for higher spin-out volume, grant inflow, and KPI credits.
- **Corporates** receive curated dealflow, pilot access, brand optics, and soft share of public euros without building their own incubator.
- **City** amplifies existing NEXT Mannheim assets without new cap-ex.
- **Studio** locks in proprietary sourcing and reduced project CAC.
* * *

Deploy this exact stack; tolerate no dilution of governance clarity or option discipline. The Factory protects public legitimacy, the Studio captures value, and the two--in combination--convert dormant research into equity at venture-level velocity.
