**Your question, sharpened:** _"From zero--post-incorporation--outline the exact sequence for instating the spine (Git + S3 + SQL + OIDC + CI + Terraform) and boot-strapping day-one operations."_
* * *

## Zero-to-Operating in **10 Pragmatic Steps**

| # | Outcome | Concrete Tasks | Decision Gate | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **1** | **Legal & financial foothold** | • Open business bank account (dual-signature).• Register for tax IDs, social insurance, trade register amendments. | Bank account live. | 
| **2** | **Root Identity Provider (OIDC)** | • Select IdP → Okta Business or Google Workspace Business.• Create org domain (e.g. _corpname.com_).• Enforce MFA + hardware key for founders. | IdP live, founders onboarded. | 
| **3** | **Source-of-Truth repo host** | • Spin up GitHub Enterprise Cloud org (or GitLab EE self-hosted).• Enable OIDC SSO from Step 2.• Create top-level groups: _Doctrine_, _Projects_, _Shared-Library_. | Repo host reachable via SSO. | 
| **4** | **Object vault** | • Create S3-compatible bucket set: `assets`, `git-lfs`, `backups`.• Enable versioning + server-side encryption.• Provision IAM roles: _ci-runner_, _design-upload_, _public-read_ (bucket-level, read-only). | Test upload via CLI succeeds. | 
| **5** | **Structured core (SQL)** | • Provision managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS Postgres / Supabase).• Create DB schemas: `metrics`, `risks`, `audit`.• Restrict access to IdP-backed users. | Connect via psql; create table succeeds. | 
| **6** | **Automation fabric** | • Stand up shared CI runner fleet (GitHub Actions Runners or GitLab Runners) in Docker-enabled VM.• Add base workflow: lint, test upload to buckets, commit tag. | "Hello World" pipeline green. | 
| **7** | **Infrastructure as Code anchor** | • Commit `infra/` Terraform modules controlling S3, IAM, Runners, DB parameters.• Lock remote state in S3 `tfstate` bucket with dynamo-style state-lock. | `terraform plan`= zero-diff. | 
| **8** | **Baseline artefact scaffolds** | • In _Doctrine_ repo, add templated files: `MasterContent.md`, `InterfaceContract.yaml`, `DecisionLog.csv`, `MetricMap.json`, `RiskSheet.csv`, `ProcessCard.svg`.• Pre-commit hook to enforce filename schema. | Commit passes hook in main. | 
| **9** | **Operational UX veneer** | • Deploy Retool Cloud (or internal) connected to Postgres + S3.• Build MVP pages: _Mission Console_, _Upload Asset_, _Decision Logger_.• Install Slack; add `/upload`, `/decision` slash-commands hitting Retool API endpoints. | FO can create Mission & upload asset via GUI. | 
| **10** | **Audit & monitoring** | • Deploy Loki (Stack) or CloudWatch log groups.• Pipe runner logs, Git webhooks, IdP auth events.• Configure alert to founders' Slack channel on failed governance checks. | First audit dashboard live. |

### Sequence Rationale

1. **Identity first** → every subsequent service trusts the IdP.

2. **Git + S3** form immutable ledgers; stand them up before any real work.

3. **SQL** next--structured metrics need a home early.

4. **CI & IaC** lock the spine against human drift.

5. **UX veneer** is last--users never wait, but governance is already in place.

## First 30-Day Gantt (Illustrative)
    
    
    Week 1:  Legal/Bank  ▇▇▇▇▇
    Week 1:  IdP         ▇▇▇
    Week 1-2: Git host   ▇▇▇▇
    Week 2:  S3 buckets  ▇▇
    Week 2-3: Postgres   ▇▇▇
    Week 3:  CI Runners  ▇▇
    Week 3-4: Terraform  ▇▇▇
    Week 4:  Artefact templates ▇
    Week 4:  Retool + Slack   ▇▇
    Week 4:  Logging stack    ▇
    

_(Total calendar time: four weeks; parallelise where headcount allows.)_

### Immediate Next Workflows

1. **Initiate first Project Workspace**  
`projects/25-P001` → scaffold via template → commit to Git.

2. **Create first Mission Pack** via Retool → auto-branch `mission/M01`.

3. **Run Sprint‐0** with tiny Cell; test "close sprint" pipeline.

4. **Hand off asset upload** to design support; validate S3 ACL.

Congratulations--you have an auditable, scriptable, zero-sprawl operating backbone by **day 30**. From here, expanding headcount or tooling means **adding leaves**, not re-grafting the trunk.
