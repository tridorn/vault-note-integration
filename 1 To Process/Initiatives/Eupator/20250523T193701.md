You're building something that has to do two jobs at the same time:

1. **Create strong startups again and again**, not by chance, but by design.

2. **Use the nearby universities** (Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Darmstadt) to get top-tier tech talent, research, and credibility.

To make that happen, the best structure is a **two-part system**:

* * *

### 1. **Eupator Venture Studio (your company)**

**What it is:** A private business that builds startups in-house.  
**Think of it as a factory that produces companies, not products.**

**What it does:**

- Comes up with ideas.
- Brings in founders (especially business people from Mannheim).
- Gives them tools (legal, tech, design, growth).
- Keeps a big piece of equity in the startups it creates (15--25%).
- Makes money if these startups grow or get sold.

**Why this works better than an incubator or accelerator:**

- You own the ideas from the beginning.
- You control how the startups are built.
- You keep more equity and don't rely on external teams to show up.
- You can build 2--3 high-quality startups per year instead of pushing dozens of mediocre ones.
* * *

### 2. **Rhine-Neckar Startup Factory (non-profit foundation)**

**What it is:** A publicly backed, university-connected hub that scouts research, talent, and ideas.  
**Think of it as a deal pipeline and legitimacy engine.**

**What it does:**

- Connects researchers and students from KIT, TU Darmstadt, and others.
- Helps turn research into startup ideas.
- Runs early-stage tests to see if ideas are worth building.
- Gives you first access to the best projects.
- Is partly funded by government and universities, and seen as "neutral".

**Why this is important:**

- You're a student; this gives you credibility and access.
- Universities trust a public partner more than a private company.
- The government is currently funding these kinds of projects.
- It makes sure you get early access to the best tech and teams.
* * *

### How They Work Together

- Eupator builds and owns startups.
- The Factory finds raw ideas and talent.
- Eupator has the **right to pick** which ideas to turn into real companies.
- You pay the Factory a fixed fee (or % equity) for this access, which helps cover its costs.
* * *

### Why this setup is smarter than other approaches

- **Accelerators** depend on already-formed startups, but you don't have many yet.
- **Incubators** give office space and events, but no real ownership or focus.
- **Pure VCs** just invest--they don't build or control the product.

Your structure **does both the building and the investing**, and **it locks in university cooperation** without needing to wait for universities to change their mindset.
* * *

### Summary

Build two parts:

1. A **for-profit venture studio** (Eupator) that owns and builds startups.

2. A **non-profit factory** that works with universities, paid partly by grants and government.  
Together, they let you start now, gain credibility fast, access talent and research, and build companies with real ownership and repeatable results.

This is how you go from zero to a serious regional innovation engine--without waiting for permission.
