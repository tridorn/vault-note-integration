You should have asked: _"Define the minimal rational Git repository architecture for a company using mission-based execution, balancing reuse, confidentiality, and operational scalability."_

Here is a **clear and actionable repo scheme**, rooted in the hybrid model assessed above.

* * *

## I. Core Repositories (Always Exist)

These are **permanent**, **shared**, and form the base layer of your architecture.

1. **`doctrine`**  
Contains:

    - Templates (MasterContent, InterfaceContract, DecisionLog)

    - Process definitions, checklists

    - Naming conventions, taxonomy

    - Codified Mission/Project structure

Access: All internal contributors  
Reason: Foundation of repeatable execution

2. **`shared-library`**  
Contains:

    - Reusable components (scripts, metrics processors, slide templates)

    - Export transformers (e.g. markdown → keynote, md → PDF)

    - Low-level utilities and tokens

Access: Engineers + technical Field Officers  
Reason: Cross-mission technical leverage

3. **`infra`**  
Contains:

    - Terraform setup for R2, Neon, CI runners

    - Workspace setup scripts

    - Environment variable schemas

Access: Infra responsible only  
Reason: Separation of concerns + auditability
* * *

## II. Project Execution Repositories

### A. **Internal Projects (not externally sensitive)**

✅ Use **monorepo**: `projects`

Structure:
    
    
    projects/
    ├── P01-Retrofit/
    │   └── mission-M01-Orion/
    ├── P02-Expansion/
    │   └── mission-M02-Basilisk/
    

- Every project has its own folder.
- Every mission has a branch: `mission/M02-Basilisk`
- `MasterContent.md`, assets, logs, metrics all live inside that branch.

Access:

- Core team + relevant Field Officers
- If needed: protect via external interface (Retool), not Git-level

Use case:

- Internal ops, strategic planning, content R&D
* * *

### B. **Client or Confidential Projects**

✅ Use **one repo per project**  
Naming: `client-<slug>` or `project-<slug>`, e.g. `client-acme`, `project-atlas`

Structure inside:
    
    
    /
    ├── MasterContent.md
    ├── mission-M01-Kickoff/
    ├── assets/
    ├── DecisionLog.csv
    └── MetricMap.json
    

Access:

- Only assigned contributors and FO
- FO maintains alignment to doctrine templates from `doctrine` repo

Reasoning:

- Reduces liability
- Enables clean client handover or audit
- Avoids accidental exposure
* * *

## III. Optional / Conditional Repos

Only created if needed:

- **`design-system`** → if you have a central brand design team
- **`data-lake`** → structured raw data, decoupled from projects
- **`retrospective-reports`** → if you standardize post-mission reporting
* * *

## IV. Summary of Creation Logic

| Repo Type | Creation Rule | Access Model | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `doctrine` | One-time; foundational | All contributors | 
| `shared-library` | One-time; reusable code + scripts | Tech contributors | 
| `projects` | Exists always; internal-only projects | Broad internal | 
| `client-*` / `project-*` | Created per external or sensitive project | Strictly scoped | 
| `infra` | Created once by Infra Ops | Infra only | 

* * *

## V. Automation Guardrails

- CI check in `projects/`: **block commits with `client-` strings in file paths**
- CI check in `client-*`: **enforce file structure from `doctrine`**
- On repo creation:

    - Auto-create branch `mission/M01-Setup`

    - Inject starter template from `doctrine`

    - Connect to Retool + Slack
* * *

This setup gives you **full privacy where required**, **full leverage where possible**, and **no fragmentation by default**. Scale is a function of need, not chaos.
