Got it — you want small but “real” projects you can build with Cursor and your new setup, each scoped so you can ship in a weekend but still learn the full loop: spec → code → deploy → get feedback.

Here’s a curated batch for “vibe coding” that’s founder-friendly but not throwaway toy apps.

⸻

1. AI-Powered FAQ Search
	•	What it is:
Upload a list of FAQs (or scrape a site), then let users type natural language questions to get the most relevant answer.
	•	Why it’s great:
Uses AI without building a whole LLM app from scratch; useful for any niche audience.
	•	Core stack: Next.js + Supabase (storage) + OpenAI API (embeddings + search)
	•	MVP scope:
	•	Upload CSV of FAQs
	•	Store embeddings in Supabase
	•	Search box → return top 3 answers
	•	Public shareable link

⸻

2. Simple Paid Link Locker
	•	What it is:
Let creators lock a file or link behind a small one-time Stripe payment.
	•	Why it’s great:
Tests Stripe integration, auth, and database basics; real monetization in <24h.
	•	Core stack: Next.js + Stripe Checkout + Supabase Auth
	•	MVP scope:
	•	Sign in
	•	Create “link” with title + URL + price
	•	Pay → unlock
	•	History page of purchased links

⸻

3. Personal Data Journal
	•	What it is:
A private web app to log and visualize daily metrics (mood, habits, workouts, etc.).
	•	Why it’s great:
Perfect for learning CRUD + charts + auth.
	•	Core stack: Next.js + Supabase + Chart.js/Recharts
	•	MVP scope:
	•	Sign in
	•	Add daily entry (fields: mood, hours slept, notes)
	•	Graph mood over time
	•	Export CSV

⸻

4. Minimal Feedback Widget
	•	What it is:
An embeddable “Feedback” button for any site that sends responses to a dashboard.
	•	Why it’s great:
You’ll build both a widget (JS snippet) and a dashboard app.
	•	Core stack: Next.js (two routes: script + dashboard), Supabase
	•	MVP scope:
	•	Create account → get snippet
	•	Paste snippet into any HTML → button appears
	•	Submissions go to Supabase
	•	Dashboard shows feedback list

⸻

5. Quick Polls for Slack
	•	What it is:
A tiny service that lets Slack users create 1-question polls via a slash command.
	•	Why it’s great:
Teaches you to integrate with third-party APIs (Slack).
	•	Core stack: Next.js API routes + Slack API + Supabase
	•	MVP scope:
	•	Slack command /poll question? opt1 opt2
	•	Store poll + votes
	•	Show results as a Slack message

⸻

6. Tiny AI Blog Post Generator
	•	What it is:
Enter a topic → get a structured blog post outline + content.
	•	Why it’s great:
Combines OpenAI API with web UI and output export.
	•	Core stack: Next.js + OpenAI API
	•	MVP scope:
	•	Input: topic + tone
	•	Generate outline + paragraphs
	•	Edit inline
	•	Export to Markdown

⸻

How to pick & start
	•	If you want instant gratification: start with #2 Paid Link Locker — shipping Stripe + Supabase gives you 80% of what you’ll use later.
	•	If you want AI from day one: start with #1 AI FAQ Search.
	•	If you want a dashboard-style app: start with #3 Personal Data Journal.

If you want, I can give you a full “Day 1–2 build guide” for one of these — including exact commands, the devcontainer setup, and the one Playwright smoke test prewritten — so you can try Cursor + your stack with no guessing.

Which one should I prepare first?
