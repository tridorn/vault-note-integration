Here’s what all of that means in **clear, blunt terms**, stripped of legal jargon:

---

## 1. **You should set up *two companies now*** — not just one.

* **Eupator Holding UG**
  You fully own this. It doesn’t do business. It just holds other companies.

* **Eupator Ventures UG**
  This is where all real activity happens: selling services, building ventures, hiring freelancers.

The **Holding UG owns 100%** of the Ventures UG.

---

## 2. **Why this is smart for you**

You said you’ll leave Germany in 3 years and move to Dubai.

Here’s the issue:
If you own a business or shares when you leave, **Germany will tax you as if you sold your company**—even if you didn’t.
This is called **Wegzugsteuer** (exit tax).

If your business is worth €500k at that point, Germany may claim tax on that as if you sold it.
This can cost you €100–150k, even if no money changed hands.

### But:

If you create a **holding now**, when the company is worth zero, then:

* You freeze the tax value of your shares at €1k.
* Most of the growth (profit, value) happens inside the Ventures UG, which the Holding owns.
* When you move to Dubai, only the **Holding** is taxed. And you’ve kept its value low.
* You can also **pay yourself dividends earlier**, before leaving, so there’s less inside when Germany calculates the tax.

---

## 3. **You still control everything**

* You are the only shareholder of the Holding UG.
* The Holding owns the Ventures UG.
* You are the Geschäftsführer (CEO) of both.
* You keep full control.
* This is legal, standard, and common among German founders planning to move abroad.

---

## 4. **Other things you’ll need to do**

* Register the Eupator brand as a trademark. It costs about €300 and protects your name legally.
* Use cloud accounting like **Lexoffice**. You won’t need a tax advisor at the start, but get one later.
* Set up both UGs via the same notary, on the same day. It costs about €1,500–2,000 total.
* Open separate bank accounts for each company.

---

## 5. **In 3 years, before leaving Germany**

* Empty out profits by paying dividends to yourself (from Ventures UG → Holding → You).
  → Germany only taxes what’s still *inside* when you leave.

* Hire a valuation expert to show the Holding isn’t worth much.

* Sever all links to Germany (address, health insurance, days spent here).

* File the exit paperwork correctly with the tax office.

---

## Summary: Do this now

* Form **two UGs**: a Holding and an Operating company.
* You’ll run everything through the Operating UG.
* You’ll own both 100%.
* This sets you up to leave Germany with the **lowest possible exit tax**, total control, and max flexibility to build Eupator without regrets.

If you do it later, it may be too late or too expensive.
Do it now while everything is still worth nothing on paper.
