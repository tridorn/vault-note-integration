A more strategic articulation of your prompt would be: **"Where and how should the firm's structural doctrine, operating rules, and living commentary reside so that it is immutable, discoverable, version-safe, and friction-light for everyday contributors?"**

* * *

### Core stance

All institutional knowledge lives in **plain-text source control**.  
Everything else--blogs, PDFs, slides--is generated from that single ledger.

* * *

#### 1 ∙ The Doctrine Codex

_Location_ `doctrine` repository root.  
_Format_ Markdown (`*.md`) and lightweight diagrams (`*.drawio`, `*.svg`).  
_Structure_ one file per atomic concept:
    
    
    doctrine/
    ├─ 00_Preface.md
    ├─ 01_Principles/
    │   ├─ autonomy.md
    │   ├─ centralised-planning.md
    │   └─...
    ├─ 02_Roles/
    │   ├─ field-officer.md
    │   └─ mission-commander.md
    ├─ 03_Units/
    │   ├─ mission.md
    │   ├─ program.md
    │   └─ campaign.md
    └─ 04_Processes/
        ├─ sprint-cycle.md
        └─ escalation-ladder.md
    

_Access_ read-only to all staff; merge rights for SO Doctrine cell.  
_Visibility_ GitHub Pages auto-renders the repo into a static site via Docusaurus; no extra CMS.

Benefits: search by file path, deterministic links (`/03_Units/mission`), and signed commit history.

* * *

#### 2 ∙ Change Flow ("RFC" mechanism)

1. Contributor opens a pull request in `doctrine-drafts` branch.

2. PR title prefix `RFC:`.

3. SO Doctrine reviews; if accepted, squash-merge → immutably tagged (`v3.2.0`).

4. CI triggers Docusaurus build; new site version published.

Result: evolution is visible, audit-safe, and gated by one accountable steward.

* * *

#### 3 ∙ Operational Commentary

_Mission-level notes_ live inside each Mission branch (`mission/M07-Kestrel/MasterContent.md`).  
They **do not** pollute the Codex.  
When a lesson becomes evergreen, FO raises an RFC to upstream it into the Doctrine Codex.

* * *

#### 4 ∙ External Artifacts

- **Client deliverables**  
Markdown ➜ Pandoc ➜ PDF in `/50_Output/Client/`.

- **Public blog posts / whitepapers**  
Select Codex pages marked `public:` in front-matter; CI copies them into a Hugo-powered public site.

No manual copy-paste. One source, many outputs.

* * *

#### 5 ∙ Editing Freedom

- **Obsidian** can mount any repo as a vault; `.obsidian/` is ignored by `.gitignore`.
- **VS Code**, **Sublime**, **vim**--all viable; the repo imposes the shape, not the editor.
- Binary drafts (Keynote, Figma) go to `assets/` and are referenced, never replace narrative text.
* * *

#### 6 ∙ What to Avoid

- Google Docs and Word as primary files: opaque versioning, binary diffs, zero automation.
- Notion as canonical store: excellent view layer, disastrous as source of truth--use API pull-through from Git if views are needed.
- SharePoint drives: guarantee sprawl and broken links.
* * *

#### 7 ∙ Minimal tool chain

_Write_ any text editor → commit → push.  
_Preview_ GitHub renders Markdown instantly; Docusaurus nightly build for styled docs.  
_Generate_ Pandoc for PDFs; Hugo for public blog; CI job per target.

* * *

### Reasoned conclusion

Keep **one immutable Codex** under Git, feed everything else from it, and allow editors of choice.  
Freedom exists at the interface layer; structure is enforced at the ledger.
