A service unit--within your venture engine--must be treated as a **modular revenue cell**: tightly scoped, operationally light, and instantly deployable. Below is the full anatomy of how one such unit is **created**, **operated**, and **monetised**within Eupator.

* * *

## I. STRUCTURAL BLUEPRINT: Anatomy of a Service Unit

| Element | Description | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Name/Brand** | Optional; can be sub-branded or anonymous. Main purpose: credibility. | 
| **Offering** | Concrete deliverables. No vagueness. E.g., "Startup Website in 10 Days" | 
| **Delivery System** | Step-by-step workflow to intake, execute, and deliver to client. | 
| **Fulfilment Strategy** | Yourself, freelancers, AI-assist, or automation. Must be fast + scalable. | 
| **Monetisation** | Flat-rate pricing (preference), milestone-based payments (if complex). | 
| **Channel** | How you acquire clients: cold outreach, inbound, referrals, or platforms. | 
| **Tracking** | Project tracker, financials, client database. | 
| **Tools** | Minimum stack to deliver quickly and professionally. | 
* * *

## II. STEP-BY-STEP: BUILDING & OPERATING A SERVICE UNIT

Let's walk through a concrete one: **WebOps -- Startup Website Service**
* * *

### 1. **Define Offering**

**Target Output**: Landing page or microsite (3--5 pages) for startups.  
**Delivery Time**: 5--10 working days  
**Price**: €800--2,000  
**Inclusions**:

- 1 design round
- Mobile responsive
- Basic copywriting
- Hosting handover
- 1 month light support

**Deliverables**: Hosted website + source files
* * *

### 2. **Setup Delivery Infrastructure**

| Phase | Action | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Tools** | Astro or Framer, Figma, Google Docs, Loom | 
| **File System** | Client folders in GDrive | 
| **Workflow** | Intake Form → Kickoff Call → Build → Review → Deliver | 
| **Freelancer Setup** | Pre-vetted dev/designer on Upwork/Fiverr/Telegram | 

**You handle**:

- Client interaction
- Briefing
- Quality check
- Final delivery  
→ This preserves control + margin
* * *

### 3. **Create Acquisition Layer**

**Outbound**:

- Cold DMs to startup founders, IndieHackers, Reddit, Discord
- Target: early-stage companies pre-Series A
- Message: "We'll build your startup's site in 7 days, fixed rate, no BS."

**Inbound/Signal**:

- Simple 1-pager website (made via Framer or Carrd)
- LinkedIn/Twitter posts showing before/after
- Showcase 2--3 case studies as fast as possible

**Price Strategy**:

- Start low (€500--700) to build trust, raise over time
- Push urgency ("2 slots left this month")
* * *

### 4. **Execute + Deliver**

#### Week Workflow Example:

| Day | Action | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Day 0 | Client signs, pays deposit (50%) | 
| Day 1 | Kickoff call, receive assets | 
| Day 2 | Wireframe + dev handoff | 
| Day 4 | Internal QA | 
| Day 5 | Client review | 
| Day 6--7 | Final fixes | 
| Day 8 | Delivery + invoice balance | 

Tools:

- Stripe/PayPal for payment
- Typeform for intake
- Notion for internal tracking
- Loom for updates
* * *

### 5. **Cashflow Mechanics**

| Action | Money Flow | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Client signs | 50% upfront = €400--1,000 | 
| You pay freelancer | €150--500 depending on scope | 
| Final delivery | 50% balance received | 
| Total gross margin | Typically 50--70% (higher if you execute design) | 

**Example**:

- €1,200 project
- €400 to freelancer
- €800 profit (before taxes)
* * *

### 6. **Feedback + Template Extraction**

After delivery, extract:

- Templates (Figma, Astro components)
- Copy scripts
- Process tweaks

Store these in your **Foundry Library** for reuse in future ventures.
* * *

## III. CRITICAL OPS INSIGHT

- **Time to First Sale**: < 2 weeks if outbound is aggressive
- **Time to Profit**: Immediate
- **Leverage**: Improves over time through automation and template reuse
- **Failure Mode**: Over-customisation, poor client scope, no process discipline
* * *

## IV. SCALE-UP PATH

| Level | What Changes | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Solo** | You manage all, fulfil or delegate | 
| **Fractional Team** | Fixed designer + dev per project | 
| **Systemised Team** | Coordinator, SOPs, pipeline running 5--10 projects/month | 
| **Spinoff Company** | Brand identity, external growth engine, full team | 
* * *

**Bottom Line:**

A service unit isn't just a job. It's **an asset**--a repeatable, profitable, semi-automated machine.  
Build one. Get it to cashflow. Then duplicate the pattern with new capabilities.  
Each becomes a self-reinforcing cell within the Eupator machine.
