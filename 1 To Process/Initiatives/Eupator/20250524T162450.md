Here is a **clear, role-based breakdown** of the two core entities--**Factory** and **Studio**--in terms of their **purpose, function, and workflow**. This will show _who does what, why it matters, and where they connect_.
* * *

## I. PURPOSES -- Fundamental Roles

| Role | Factory | Studio | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Core Purpose** | Source, validate, and prepare venture-grade projects from universities and corporates | Build, capitalise, and scale those ventures with operational discipline and ownership | 
| **Primary Beneficiaries** | Universities, researchers, public funders | Founders, investors, the venture engine (you) | 
| **Legitimacy Anchor** | Institutional trust, neutrality, public grants | Execution power, capital, speed, equity capture | 

They are **complementary but non-overlapping**:

- Factory **discovers** and **prepares**.
- Studio **decides**, **builds**, and **owns**.
* * *

## II. WORKFLOW OVERVIEW -- What Happens Where

### 1. **Input Phase -- Discovery**

| Factory | Studio | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Scouts researchers, PhDs, and corporate R&D | Observes, gives input on promising directions | 
| Runs info sessions and roadshows at KIT, TU Darmstadt, Mannheim | May suggest strategic themes ("we're looking for AI x industry use cases") | 
| Collects pre-validated ideas (TRL 3--5) and early teams | Prepares resources if validated | 

**Key Output:**  
→ Shortlist of ~10 candidate projects per cohort

* * *

### 2. **Validation Sprint (6 weeks)**

| Factory | Studio | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Assigns venture architects to guide teams | Optional observer role in coaching or selection | 
| Provides €8--10k prototyping grants per team | Does not fund at this stage | 
| Hosts expert reviews, mentors, kill sessions | Tracks metrics for potential investment decision | 

**Key Output:**  
→ 3--4 high-potential ventures with MVP, founding team, IP/licence clarity

* * *

### 3. **Pre-Spinout Decision Window (4 weeks)**

| Factory | Studio | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Offers Eupator an exclusive 60-day option on each project | Runs internal diligence: team fit, market, velocity | 
| Manages EXIST or GO-Bio grant paperwork if required | Drafts term sheet, begins cap table structuring | 
| Finalises IP licence terms from university | Prepares incorporation and operational plan | 

**Key Output:**  
→ Go / No-Go decision per validated team.  
→ Studio either spins out, or project is offered to external market.

* * *

### 4. **Build Phase (0--9 months post-spinout)**

| Factory | Studio | 
| ---- | ----  |
| No longer operationally involved | Fully leads build: MVP refinement, hiring, fundraising, GTM | 
| May provide light PR or network access | Provides shared resources (legal, product, growth) | 
| Collects reporting for grant KPIs | Owns equity, reports back quarterly | 

**Key Output:**  
→ Startup built, investor-ready, first external capital raised.

* * *

### 5. **Funding / Growth**

| Factory | Studio | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Passive role, KPI tracking | Active role: raises pre-seed / seed / follow-on via fund or LPs | 
| May help with public program re-application (e.g. EXIST Phase 2) | Studio fund may lead rounds; studio team may join board | 

* * *

## III. WHERE THEY CONNECT

| Connection Point | Function | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Option contract** | Studio gets exclusive right to spin out select projects. | 
| Factory doesn't "push" anything; Studio chooses. |  | 
| **Staff interaction** | Studio pays cost + 15% for any Factory staff used in building phase. Factory remains clean of startup execution. | 
| **Governance cross-link** | Studio has observer seat on Factory investment committee. Factory director has reporting line to Studio for deal KPIs. | 
| **Data exchange** | Factory gives per-project sprint metrics. Studio reports startup performance quarterly. | 
| **Events & PR** | Joint demo days, founder showcases, government visits--branded jointly but executed by Factory. | 
* * *

## IV. DIFFERENCES IN FUNCTION

| Dimension | Factory | Studio | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Ownership** | Owns no equity | Owns 15--25% of each spinout | 
| **Speed** | Cohort cadence, grant-bound | Fast, async, capital-flexible | 
| **Trust Base** | Universities, public bodies | Founders, capital, market actors | 
| **Revenue Model** | Grants + memberships | Equity + fund carry + service margin | 
| **Risk Appetite** | Low (portfolio filtering) | High (focused bets) | 
| **End Goal** | Validate projects that could become companies | Build companies that can become scalable ventures | 
* * *

## V. ANALOGY (without dumbing down)

| If the **Factory** is the **mine** (discovers, processes ore),  
| the **Studio** is the **refinery** (converts ore to gold and sells it).
* * *

## VI. Why This Division Matters

- It protects **legitimacy**: the Factory is "neutral," which is necessary to interact with slow-moving public actors.
- It enables **ownership**: the Studio has unilateral control where it matters--IP, equity, team, capital.
- It reduces **execution drag**: the Factory doesn't slow down venture building because it stops before real operational risk begins.
- It aligns **incentives**: the Factory wins by volume and throughput; the Studio wins by selectivity and value creation.
