### 1. Locate Liquidity with Digital Blind-Spots

| Segment | Indicative free cash | Digital fluency | Procurement style | Rationale | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Owner-led Mittelstand (100--500 FTE) | €2--20 m p.a. | Patchy ERP, minimal AI | Direct mandate by GF | 72 % still run on dated on-prem systems; only 28 % experiment with AI ([Xinhua News](https://english.news.cn/europe/20241125/22d05eace49043ab8fda434be37e31a6/c.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | 
| Skilled-craft groups (15--40 technicians) | €0.5--3 m | Sub-30 % digital projects completed ([KfW](https://www.kfw.de/PDF/Download-Center/Konzernthemen/Research/PDF-Dokumente-Digitalisierungsbericht-Mittelstand/KfW-Digitalisierungsbericht-EN/KfW-SME-Digitalisation-Report-2024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | "Handshake" deals | Productivity gaps are obvious, decision cycles fast | 
| Multi-doctor practices / MVZ | €0.3--2 m | Low IT staff | Practice manager | Regulatory pressure; billable hour leverage | 
| Tax & legal partnerships (50+ headcount) | €0.5--5 m | Legacy DMS, no AI | Equity committee | Routinely pay externals to offload grunt work | 
| Kommunale Eigenbetriebe & Stiftungen | €1--30 m budgets | Bureaucratic, analogue | Amtsleiter / Geschäftsführer | Must spend earmarked digital-fund money, low internal capability |

### 2. Value Proposition: "Outcome First, Invisible AI"

Deliverables must look artisanal, feel expensive, cost you little.

| Pain you exploit | Outcome you sell | Hidden tooling | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Manual report creation eats manager time | 25-page competitive dossier in German & English, delivered in 72 h | GPT-4o research chain → Claude editing → Adobe Express layout | 
| Compliance checklists stuck in Word templates | Interactive SOP portal with search and versioning | OCR → GPT structuring → Notion API → local-hosted search | 
| CEO cannot visualise KPI trends | Executive dashboard with weekly PDF brief | SQL-agent + LLM commentary → Datawrapper export | 
| Recruiting ads underperform | 30-sec branded recruitment videos | Synthesia avatars → Midjourney B-roll → CapCut montage | 

Client never sees prompts or generators--only polished artefacts.

### 3. Credibility Bridge for a First-timer

1. **Trojan wedge**  
Fixed-fee micro-engagement: "One-Week Efficiency Audit, €1 200, money-back if no ≥10 h save identified." Risk asymmetry tilts in your favour because audit content is AI-assisted.

2. **Borrowed authority**  
• Co-sell with a local Steuerberater.  
• Speak at the IHK Digitaler Mittelstand breakfast; chambers crave speakers.  
• Publish a two-page white paper quoting KfW and Bitkom data (citations above).

3. **Visible craft cues**  
Professionally typeset PDFs, on-site photos, German hosting, liability insurance certificate. Mittelstand buyers equate formality with competence.

4. **Performance pricing option**  
Offer 50 % of fee contingent on a quantified metric--e.g., hours logged in new workflow three months post-deployment. They see alignment; you know the metric is easy to hit because AI lifted the work.

### 4. Operational Micro-Playbook (Single Engagement)

| Day | Your action | Sub-contract / tool | Cash flow | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 0 | Sign NDA + 50 % deposit via Stripe | -- | +€1 500 | 
| 1 | Intake interview (30 min) | Otter.ai transcript | -- | 
| 1--2 | Data dump → LLM research chain | GPT-4o batch prompts | -- | 
| 3 | Draft dossier, internal QA | Freelance copy-editor €150 | --€150 | 
| 4 | Design polish | Adobe Express template | -- | 
| 5 | Loom walkthrough, collect edits | -- | -- | 
| 6 | Final delivery, invoice balance | -- | +€1 500 | 

Your direct variable cost ≈ €150; perceived value €3 000.

Margin funds portfolio pieces that close the next client.

### 5. Scale Logic

1. **Repeat** the micro-playbook until you own five testimonials.

2. **Template** the entire chain inside Notion (intake, prompts, style guide).

3. **Train** a virtual assistant to run steps 1--3; you only quality-check.

4. **Package** the service as the first Ops division once revenue ≥€5 k monthly with ≤20 h founder input.

5. **Parallelise** new wedges (video, dashboards) using the same trust assets.

### 6. Key Rules

- Lead with **time or compliance saved**, never with "AI".
- Quote **mid-four-figure fees**; low pricing signals amateur.
- Keep **prompt libraries proprietary**; NDA covers method secrecy.
- Align every offer to a **director-level pain** that surfaces in <90-day reporting cycles.

Start with one wedge, execute flawlessly, harvest proof. Capital follows demonstrated relief, not your résumé.
