Perfect -- let's put the big frame into motion with three concrete scenarios.

Each shows what your structure might look like in Year 5 of operations, including cash flows, ownership, and control.

* * *

# ðŸ“ˆ Scenario 1 -- "Pure Private Compounder" (no IPO yet)
- PlatformCo A (industrial services SaaS)

    - HoldCo: 40%

    - Founders + ESOP: 60%

    - EBITDA: â‚¬12m, FCF margin 25% â†’ â‚¬3m annual dividend upstream to HoldCo.
- PlatformCo B (workflow automation healthcare)

    - HoldCo: 55%

    - Founders + ESOP: 45%

    - Still reinvesting â†’ breakeven.
- AdjacencyCo X (AI data tools)

    - HoldCo: 30% + board + call option.

    - Growing fast, break-even in Year 6.
- AdjacencyCo Y (supply chain analytics, 25%)

    - Minority + info rights.

  

HoldCo position (Year 5):

- FCF received: â‚¬3m
- Overhead/shared ops spend: â‚¬1m
- Net FCF at HoldCo: â‚¬2m (self-funding newco seeds + buybacks).
- Control intact, no outside interference.

  

Narrative: still "pure private," small and tight solar system.

* * *

# ðŸ“Š Scenario 2 -- "Selective IPO for Liquidity & Currency"
- PlatformCo A (IPO at Year 4, logistics tech)

    - EV at IPO: â‚¬400m

    - 30% free float â†’ HoldCo retains 55% post-IPO voting control.

    - Annual FCF: â‚¬10m â†’ HoldCo receives ~â‚¬5.5m dividends.

    - IPO proceeds: â‚¬100m raised, partly used for M&A in that vertical.
- PlatformCo B (private, healthcare ops automation)

    - HoldCo: 45%

    - FCF: â‚¬4m, upstreaming â‚¬1.8m.
- AdjacencyCo X (AI data tools, 30%)

    - Hit triggers â†’ HoldCo exercises call, moves to 55% in Year 5.
- AdjacencyCo Y (minority 20%)

    - Still private, valued â‚¬25m.

  

HoldCo position (Year 5):

- Dividends: ~â‚¬7.3m/year.
- Liquidity: IPO allowed â‚¬20m secondary sale â†’ HoldCo repaid RCF, funded 3 new studio builds.
- Parent remains private but with cash + public stock as strategic weapons.

  

Narrative:

- HoldCo is now a mini-Berkshire with one listed jewel.
- Still centered around operating leverage, not asset management fees.
* * *

# ðŸš€ Scenario 3 -- "Hybrid with Dynasty Lock-in"
- Family Foundation owns super-voting stake in Parent HoldCo.
- PlatformCo A (IPO) -- 60% voting retained.
- PlatformCo B (private) -- cash cow, â‚¬8m FCF/year, dividends upstream.
- AdjacencyCo Z (new) -- acquired 70% stake via HoldCo + Sidecar; FCF â‚¬2m, growing.

  

Cash picture:

- Dividends upstream: ~â‚¬10--12m/year consolidated.
- HoldCo overhead: â‚¬2m (covered easily).
- Net retained FCF: â‚¬8--10m/year = permanent flywheel.
- Dynasty: governance locked; capital recycling rules embedded.

  

Narrative:

- Parent HoldCo = permanent capital engine.
- Family has safe liquidity windows (annual tenders), but business is not forced to exit.
- Public sub used as M&A vehicle; private subs provide steady cash.
- This is the "dynasty mode" you'd move into after proving repeatability.
* * *

# ðŸ”‘ Cross-scenario takeaways

1. IPO is a tool, not a destination.

    - IPO a sub only when it lowers your cost of capital or gives you a stock currency for roll-ups.

    - Always keep Parent HoldCo private.

2. Control is preserved through governance & voting, not raw equity %.

    - Founders can have 55--65% at start; you retain strategic levers via board/veto rights.

3. Cash is the flywheel.

    - Dividends from PlatformCos fund new builds, bolt-ons, and liquidity programs at HoldCo.

    - Avoid dependence on perpetual external capital.

4. Family structure decouples mission vs money.

    - Foundation/Stiftung (if dynasty) = mission lock and voting.

    - Family HoldCo = economic upside and liquidity windows.
* * *

âœ… In Year 5, if this works, you have:

- 2--3 PlatformCos (1 possibly IPO'd), 1--2 AdjacentCos, plus 3--5 early newcos in pipeline.
- HoldCo receiving â‚¬5--10m/year in cash to redeploy.
- Option to dynasty-lock (Scenario 3) or remain a focused operator (Scenario 2).

Would it help if I build a simple financial model spreadsheet (showing HoldCo cash flows, equity % shifts, and dividends across these 3 scenarios)? That way you could tweak assumptions (IPO size, ownership %, FCF margins) and see how the flywheel behaves.
