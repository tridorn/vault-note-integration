**Refined Expression of Your Request**

> *“Your admonition against premature coding is well‑taken. I am presently sequencing the operational flows. Please delineate the critical flows—showing the order, actions, and interactions—so I have an unequivocal blueprint.”*

## Systemic Flow Map – From Zero to Full‑Cycle Servicing

Below, each flow is modular.  Activate the first three; graft the others only when the prior loop is demonstrably repeatable.

| # | Flow | Primary Actors | Purpose | Trust Checkpoints |
|---|------|----------------|---------|-------------------|
| **0** | **Actor‑Onboarding & Credentialing** | SME ↔ Vendor ↔ Platform ↔ Bank | Capture KYC/KYB, green credentials, API contracts. | ‑ Digital identity & AML<br>‑ Green‑product certification |
| **1** | **Opportunity Origination (Vendor‑Led)** | Vendor → SME → Platform | Surface a green‑asset purchase and route it into financing. | ‑ Vendor issues tamper‑proof quote<br>‑ SME signs data‑sharing consent |
| **2** | **Data Verification (Green & Credit)** | Platform ↔ External Verifier | Translate technical specs into (a) carbon‑impact delta, (b) collateral parameters. | ‑ Third‑party attestation tokens<br>‑ Immutable audit log |
| **3** | **Loan Packaging & Submission** | Platform → Bank | Auto‑compile dossier: SME financials, impact model, repayment schedule. | ‑ Cryptographic checksum on dossier<br>‑ Timestamped submission receipt |
| **4** | **Credit Decision & Term‑Setting** | Bank ↔ Platform ↔ SME | Bank renders decision; platform echoes terms and captures acceptance. | ‑ E‑signature & IP‑stamped acceptance |
| **5** | **Disbursement & Vendor Settlement** | Bank → Vendor (via Platform escrow) | Funds released, conditional on dual confirmation (bank & platform). | ‑ Escrow smart contract or safeguarded account |
| **6** | **Implementation Verification** | Vendor ↔ Platform ↔ External Inspector | Confirm asset installation / project completion. | ‑ Geo‑tagged photo + inspector report |
| **7** | **Impact Monitoring & Reporting** | Platform → Bank / Regulator | Periodic ingestion of performance data; generate ESG compliance reports. | ‑ Automated IoT or invoice feeds<br>‑ Integrity hash chains |
| **8** | **Servicing & Exception Handling** | SME ↔ Bank ↔ Platform | Payment collection, delinquency workflow, refinancing if needed. | ‑ Real‑time repayment telemetry |

## How to Operationalise in Sequence

1. **Phase α: Prove the “Origination → Decision” Loop (Flows 0‑4).**  
   *Instrumentation:* low‑code forms, DocuSign, secured email.  
   *Success Criterion:* one executed term sheet.

2. **Phase β: Automate Disbursement & Implementation (Flow 5‑6).**  
   Introduce conditional escrow; integrate a third‑party inspection API.

3. **Phase γ: Embed Continuous Monitoring (Flow 7).**  
   Decide whether to ingest IoT metres or reconcile energy bills—cost vs. signal.

4. **Phase δ: Industrialise Servicing (Flow 8).**  
   Connect to bank loan‑servicing core or layer a white‑label module.

Each phase compounds credibility; treat tech as a prosthetic for trust, not a monument to engineering.

## Tactical Imperatives

- **Single‑Vertical Focus:** pilot with one vendor type (e.g., rooftop solar installers) to minimise data‑model entropy.  
- **Trust Artifacts First, Code Second:** draft the legal/verification templates before you write a line of platform logic.  
- **Scalable Compliance Backbone:** design every checkpoint so that incremental regulatory overlays (EU Taxonomy, CSRD) are toggles, not rewrites.

Should you require a more granular RACI matrix or wish to stress‑test any specific flow, indicate which phase, and we will dissect it with surgical precision.
