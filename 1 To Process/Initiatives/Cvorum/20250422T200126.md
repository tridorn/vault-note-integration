**Refined Expression of Your Prompt:**

> *"You're absolutely rightâ€”the advice to delay tech development until operational flows are clearly defined is spot-on. I'm currently in the process of identifying and sequencing those flows. Could you map out which core process flows might be relevant for a green loan enablement platform, and in what sequence they should be structured?"*

**Strategic Counsel: Flow Architecture for a Green Loan Enablement Platform**

You're not building a product. You're choreographing **transactional trust between asymmetric actors**, each with divergent incentives, timelines, and constraints. Thus, your first strategic deliverable is not code, but a **flowchart of belief and verification**. Below is a deconstructed **flow taxonomy**, sequenced by **cumulative validation**, starting from the lowest complexity loop and moving toward scalable orchestration.

---

### I. **Foundational Microflows**  
(*These are atomic trust-building operations; start here.*)

1. **SME Intent Capture Flow**  
   - Input: SME registers interest in green financing.
   - Output: Categorized project need (e.g., solar, HVAC, EV fleet, retrofitting).
   - Tool: Typeform, Airtable, or no-code form.
   - Purpose: Signal capture; test demand verticals.

2. **Vendor Pre-Qualification Flow**  
   - Input: List of preferred vendors in key verticals.
   - Output: Verified green certification, onboarding terms, product catalog.
   - Tool: Manual onboarding + data room or Notion page.
   - Purpose: Assemble offer-side; establish supply trust.

3. **Bank Willingness Flow**  
   - Input: Outreach to ESG or SME financing desks.
   - Output: Documented loan criteria, underwriting preferences, ticket size range.
   - Tool: CRM or shared spreadsheet.
   - Purpose: Define institutional appetite; extract policy thresholds.

### II. **Initial Transaction Flow (Pilot Loop)**  
(*This is your MVP: one live deal brokered, manually orchestrated.*)

#### ðŸŽ¯ Objective: Complete a green CapEx financing loop **without software**, just process.

**Step 1: SME Application â†’ Internal Intake Form**  
- Purpose: Gather financials, project type, estimated cost.  
- Challenge: SME data is messyâ€”create a lightweight scoring system.  
- Output: Basic creditworthiness and green eligibility.

**Step 2: Project Matching â†’ Match with Pre-Onboarded Vendor**  
- Match SME to vendor catalog or direct contact.  
- If CapEx quote is available, move to the next step.

**Step 3: Financing Proposal â†’ Structure Indicative Term Sheet with Bank**  
- Submit SME+Project data to bank partner via a preformatted template.  
- Validate that the bank is willing to issue a loan on these terms.  
- Ensure legal and ESG thresholds are satisfied.

**Step 4: Execution**  
- Loan issued, project delivered, payment flows initiated.  
- Final milestone: vendor is paid, SME receives asset/service, bank disburses capital.

**Step 5: Feedback Capture & KPI Logging**  
- Track conversion time, stakeholder friction, risk signals.  
- Document all steps manuallyâ€”this is your proto-playbook.

### III. **Operational Flows (Post-Pilot Scaling)**

Once you have **1â€“3 successful loops**, extend to these flows:

1. **Verification Flow**  
   - Add third-party validation of green impact (COâ‚‚ reduction, energy savings).  
   - Partner with certifiers or use vendor-provided documents.  
   - This becomes a core value-add for both bank and ESG reporting.

2. **Underwriting Augmentation Flow**  
   - Introduce structured SME credit scoring via API integrations (e.g., accounting data, revenue, ESG profile).  
   - Goal: reduce bank underwriting friction, improve loan approval rate.

3. **Rebate/Subsidy Integration Flow**  
   - For certain CapEx (solar, insulation), governments offer rebates.  
   - Build a mechanism to help SMEs apply, or collect on their behalf.  
   - This increases affordability â†’ conversion â†’ impact.

4. **Platform Referral Flow (SME â†’ SME)**  
   - Once youâ€™ve succeeded with several SMEs, let them refer others.  
   - Cheap growth loop with high trust-to-noise ratio.

### IV. **Flow Prioritization Framework**

Use a *Leverage vs. Complexity* matrix to rank flows:

| Flow | Leverage | Complexity | Priority |
|------|----------|------------|----------|
| SME Intent Capture | High | Low | ðŸ”¥ Immediate |
| Vendor Onboarding | Medium | Low | ðŸ”¥ Immediate |
| Bank Criteria Mapping | High | Medium | ðŸ”¥ Immediate |
| Manual Pilot Loop | Very High | Medium | ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Core |
| Green Verification | Very High | High | ðŸŸ¡ Later |
| Underwriting Automation | High | High | ðŸŸ¡ Later |
| Rebate Integration | Medium | High | ðŸŸ¡ Later |
| SME Referral Loop | Medium | Low | ðŸ”¥ Medium Term |

### Final Counsel: 
Do not mistake flows for features. Your real MVP is *operational choreography*, not UI/UX. Each flow is a test of trust: can actors exchange value through you without prior history?

Would you like a visual process map of this architecture? Or a Notion-style playbook template to track pilots step by step?
