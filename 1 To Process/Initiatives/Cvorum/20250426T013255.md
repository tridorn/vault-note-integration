### The strategic question  
> **“Europe is big, the Mittelstand is vast, green-field SaaS feels sexy—where should Eupator strike first if we want to move from zero to scale without blowing up capital or diluting governance?”**

Below is a **rational path upward**—sequenced, risk-weighted, and matched to your Corpus-driven edge.

---

## 1 Start where your edge is maximal: **Succession-stage Mittelstand (DACH €2–10 m EBITDA)**  

| Why this niche? | Corpus leverage | Capital reality |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **95 000 German firms** need ownership transition this decade; owners value trusted hands and long horizon more than top-ticket PE price. | Governance/Form layers fix reporting gaps fast; Initiative can stay mostly local—low cultural resistance. | Deals clear at 4–6× EBITDA (lower when owner wants speed + legacy); can be financed 40 % cash, 60 % local debt. |

> *Your proposition to the retiring owner:*  
> “Keep 10 % rollover, get a fair multiple, watch your firm live on—same people, but upgraded structure and perpetual capital.”

---

## 2 Bolt on **B2B tech spin-outs** inside the acquired Mittelstand platform  

- Many Mittelstand manufacturers or service firms sit on under-monetised data/process IP.  
- Studio team launches a SaaS or marketplace that sells to the parent’s customer base.  
- Parent supplies domain expertise + first 20 reference customers; Studio supplies Corpus launch kit.

Result: **internal optionality**—each boring asset hides a venture-scale option.

## 3 Geographic playbook: concentric-circle Europe  

| Wave | Target zone | Entry logic |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Wave 1 (Years 0–3)** | **DACH** (Germany–Austria–Switzerland) | • Legal familiarity • Deep Mittelstand pool • Cultural proximity |
| **Wave 2 (Years 3–5)** | **Nordics & BeNeLux** | • Similar trust culture • High SME tech adoption → easier SaaS cross-sell |
| **Wave 3 (Years 5–8)** | **Central/Eastern Europe** | • Manufacturing clusters • Lower multiples • Talent cost arbitrage |

> **Rule:** Expand only when the Corpus team can run diagnostics in local language & law without outside consultants.

---

## 4 Capital ladder  

| Stage | Capital source | Typical cheque | Use |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-----|
| **Seed fly-wheel** | Studio spin-out profits | €0.5–1 m / yr | Fund first micro-buy-out cash component |
| **HoldCo credit line** | Swiss / German banks (secured on acquired EBITDA) | up to 3× EBITDA per deal | Debt portion of €3–10 m acquisitions |
| **Evergreen Fund I** (LP) | Family offices €50 m | €2–5 m equity per deal | Coinvest; reserves for SaaS acceleration |
| **Internal free-cash float** | Dividends from portfolio | grows to €10–15 m/yr by Year 6 | New deals without dilution |

---

## 5 Milestones—straight line up  

| Year | KPI gate | Strategic act |
|------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | First Mittelstand acquisition closed; SaaS spin-out blueprint drafted | Validate Corpus-lite integration |
| 2 | Portfolio FCF ≥ €3 m; Diagnostic scores ≥ 3/5 across clusters | Recruit partner (Steward deputy) + begin Evergreen fundraise |
| 3 | Fund I closes (€50 m); 3 acquisitions + 2 spin-outs live | Launch Corpus Academy for internal talent |
| 5 | Consolidated FCF ≥ €15 m; SaaS ARR ≥ €8 m | Wave 2 geography; optional 2nd fund or bond issue |
| 8 | Group EBITDA ≥ €50 m across 10+ platforms | Consider partial listing of holding or perpetual note to recycle capital faster |

---

## 6 Why this beats “go pure VC” or “be generic PE”

| Dimension | Eupator path | VC studio | Mid-market PE |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Deal flow** | Underserved succession owners + captive spin-outs | Over-fished SaaS seed rounds | Auctions, high multiples |
| **Edge** | Corpus structure + evergreen capital | Brand + demo days | Cheap leverage |
| **Time horizon** | ∞ (foundation) | 5–8 yrs exit | 3–7 yrs exit |
| **Execution risk** | Moderate—Core processes exist in target firms | High—0→1 every time | Low on buy-outs, high on tech add-ons |

---

## 7 Conditions for success (must-haves)

1. **German-speaking deal lead** who can win trust of family owners.  
2. **Corpus-lite integration playbook** ready before first LOI (Governance & Form checklists, not full Initiative overhaul).  
3. **SaaS seed pod** (3–5 engineers + PM) embedded in Studio by Month 6.  
4. **Underwritten credit facility** arranged early; don’t rely solely on fund equity.  
5. **Cultural positioning**: “Succession guardian, not cost-cutter.” – emphasise permanence, employee continuity, and strategic upside.

### Short version  
> **Focus**: DACH succession Mittelstand 3–10 m EBITDA.  
> **Edge**: Corpus installs structural hygiene fast; Studio mines hidden SaaS plays.  
> **Scale**: Recycle free cash + evergreen LP money; expand outwards as diagnostic capacity scales.  
> **Goal**: €50 m group EBITDA inside eight years— Europe’s first Berkshire-style, Corpus-powered compounder.

Start with the first owner-call list—10 firms where the founder is 60 +, EBIT margins > 12 %, and tech usage < 30 %. That’s Loop 0.
