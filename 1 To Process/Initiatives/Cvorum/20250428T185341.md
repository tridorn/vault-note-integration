### **Strategic North Star**

*Monopolise the evidentiary rail that German and EU lenders must use to prove the “greenness” of SME credit under the EBA’s 2025 ESG-risk file and the forthcoming SME Sustainable-Finance Standard.*  All tactical moves below serve that singular objective.

---

## 24-Month Marching Plan

#### **Phase 0 — Regulatory Beach-head (Month 0-3)**
1. **License Choice:** Operate initially under a §34c GewO *Finanzierungsvermittlung* licence (loan broker) while applying for a BaFin §32 KWG *Finanzdienstleistung* permission only if custody of funds becomes necessary.  Engage BaFin’s **FinTech Innovation Hub** to pre-clear the model and extract supervisory goodwill.  ([FinTech Innovation Hub - BaFin](https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/FinTech/fintech_node_en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
2. **Standards Embedding:** Hard-code the draft **EU SME Sustainable-Finance Standard** taxonomy fields into your data model; when it is finalised (expected H2 2025), you are already compliant while rivals scramble.  ([Platform on Sustainable Finance report: Streamlining sustainable ...](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/platform-sustainable-finance-report-streamlining-sustainable-finance-smes_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [EU: EU Proposes SME Sustainable Finance Standard to Boost ESG ...](https://www.ifcreview.com/news/2025/april/eu-eu-proposes-sme-sustainable-finance-standard-to-boost-esg-funding-access/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
3. **Sandbox Entry:** Apply to the EU Digital Finance Sandbox; leverage the “supervisory trial environment” to validate your risk-file output against the EBA’s template 4.0 taxonomy.  ([[XLS] Instructions - European Banking Authority](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-01/8ae9b8f9-f168-4b2d-bd5f-e03453a18b7a/Template%20categorisation%20for%204.0%20DPM%20%28January%202025%29.xlsx?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

#### **Phase 1 — MVP + Wedge Pilot (Month 3-6)**
1. **Scope Narrowly:** Target *heat-pump retrofits for light-industrial SMEs* in Baden-Württemberg; one technology, one geography, tight underwriting model.  
2. **Vendor Lock-in:** Sign exclusivity with three tier-1 installers; impose API data feeds as a non-negotiable.  
3. **MVP Stack:** Ship the ingestion spine, taxonomy engine, and PDF + JSON risk-file generator.  Success metric: *application-to-yes ≤ 7 days*.  

#### **Phase 2 — Guarantee Stack & Capital Scaling (Month 6-12)**
1. **KfW + Bürgschaftsbank Overlay:** Integrate the KfW-295 energy-efficiency programme plus an 80 % regional guarantee to collapse LGD.  Pitch Sparkassen and Volksbanken: *zero incremental RWA* meets *new green-asset quota*.  
2. **InvestEU Window:** Exploit the **€2.5 bn guarantee boost** now under EU consideration; position yourself as the conduit that can mobilise 10× leverage into German SMEs.  ([European Commission plans InvestEU guarantee boost, draft document shows](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/european-commission-proposes-investeu-guarantee-boost-draft-document-shows-2025-02-20/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
3. **Metric to Publish:** *50 funded projects, €15 m aggregate, realised default rate < 0.3 %*.  Make those numbers public—they become a narrative weapon.  

#### **Phase 3 — Regulatory-grade Data Moat (Month 12-18)**
1. **Continuous MRV Roll-out:** Extend IoT monitoring to insulation and PV; covenant checks shift from annual PDFs to daily variance flags.  
2. **EBA Pillar 3 API:** Map your data exhaust directly to the **EBA centralised Pillar 3 hub** spec; offer banks a one-click upload.  ([The EBA publishes its final draft technical standards to implement a ...](https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-its-final-draft-technical-standards-implement-centralised-eba-pillar-3-data-hub?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
3. **White-label OEM:** License the dashboard to Landesbanken; they keep the client, you keep the telemetry. Switching costs compound.  

#### **Phase 4 — Continental Expansion & Series A (Month 18-24)**
1. **Market Entry Playbook:** Replicate Germany template in Austria and the Netherlands—jurisdictions with aligned guarantee regimes and high SME energy spend.  
2. **Series A Narrative:** “We control the live ESG fingerprint of €250 m SME assets; replacing us means re-auditing 9,000 data feeds.”  
3. **Adjacency Option:** Offer embedded *efficiency-as-a-service* contracts (off-balance-sheet) for SMEs priced out of debt—pre-empt the ESCO substitute threat.

## Critical Decision Gates

| Gate | Evidence Required | Pivot if Failed |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| **PMF @ M6** | ≥ 30 SME leads convert, vendor NPS > 60 | Broaden tech scope to include LED package to boost TAM |
| **Risk-adjusted Yield @ M12** | Bank partner prices loans ≤ 300 bps over KfW ref-rate | Inject public guarantee layer until spread target hit |
| **Data Moat Traction @ M18** | ≥ 70 % of funded assets stream telemetry | Mandate IoT install in vendor contracts; subsidise sensors |

## Funding Blueprint

| Round | Timing | Quantum | Use-of-Proceeds | Valuation Logic |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Pre-Seed** | Now | €1.5 m | Licence process, MVP build, vendor integrations | Discounted cash flow of 100 pilot loans |
| **Seed** | M9 | €5 m | Guarantee onboarding, Sparkasse roll-out | 10× annualised net revenue from pilot region |
| **Series A** | M18 | €15-20 m | EU expansion, MRV scale, data-science hires | Network-effect multiple on €250 m AUM telemetry |

## Unvarnished Risk Ledger & Counter-moves

| Risk | Impact | Counter-measure |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Regulatory Dilution** (Omnibus package slashing CSRD scope)  ([EU slashes sustainability red tape - at what cost?](https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/sustainability/eu-slashes-sustainability-red-tape-andnbspat-what-cost?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Cuts banks’ urgency to buy ESG data | Pivot value-prop to *energy-cost arbitrage*; compliance becomes a free add-on |
| **Vendor Malfeasance** | Reputational & default blow-up | Escrow disbursement tied to sensor-verified commissioning; immediate blacklist on anomaly |
| **Bank Copycat** | Disintermediation | Hold proprietary longitudinal MRV + guarantee paperwork workflow—migration cost prohibitive |

---

### **Imperative Next Action (Week 0-1)**

1. **Secure BaFin Hub call slot**—obtain a written “no-objection” memo to de-risk investor concerns.  
2. **Freeze MVP spec** with SME Standard fields; lock dev sprints.  
3. **Issue term sheets** to three anchor installers—exclusivity in exchange for *48-hour payment on commissioning*.

*Execute these within seven calendar days; everything else is noise.*
