# Sync with ProCredit on Pilot

## Objectives

- Clearly communicate **my core idea** and how it can potentially help ProCredit specifically.
- Gain a deeper understanding of **ProCredit’s strategic pain points** and needs around green finance (beyond general assumptions).
- Obtain specific **next steps** (e.g., a deeper exploratory call, an internal introduction, or a small pilot commitment).

## Agenda

1. Introduction
- Briefly introduce yourself and the initiative (student incubator, your motivation, strong interest in green finance).
- Set a collaborative tone explicitly:  
  *“I’ve prepared something concrete to show you—but equally important for me today is understanding your perspective on how this aligns with your strategic priorities.”*
2. Questions (pain points)
- Ask specific, direct questions to reveal their actual needs, e.g.:
  - *“What’s currently your biggest challenge when it comes to financing SME green projects?”*  
  - *“Do SMEs frequently abandon loan applications due to complexity or documentation issues?”*  
  - *“What prevents you today from rapidly growing your green lending portfolio?”*  
- Let them articulate the **real pain points** clearly. Listen actively, take notes.
3. Our Approach
- Briefly, clearly articulate your core idea:  
  *“What we’re developing is a digital platform—Veridian—that simplifies and accelerates green project financing, making it easy for SMEs to scope projects, get vendor quotes, and submit clean, standardized applications directly to banks like yours.”*
- Connect explicitly to pain points mentioned earlier:  
  - *“Based on what you shared, our solution could directly reduce your underwriting time/costs...”*
- Showcase briefly your prepared prototype or demo, succinctly and calmly. Don’t rush—clarity over speed.
4. Validation
- Check relevance explicitly:  
  - *“Does this approach match your actual experience with SME lending?”*  
  - *“What parts of this solution do you feel resonate most closely with your current goals?”*
- Identify potential friction points explicitly:  
  - *“Do you foresee internal obstacles in adopting a solution like this—such as compliance, integration, or data challenges?”*
5. Q&A
- Encourage them to openly ask questions, express doubts, or challenge assumptions.
- Answer concisely and directly. If unsure, acknowledge clearly:  
  - *“That’s an excellent point—I don’t have a perfect answer today, but it's precisely the kind of feedback we're looking to incorporate.”*
6. Next Steps
- Clearly recap why you think there is mutual value.
- Propose concrete next steps explicitly:  
  - *“Would you be open to a follow-up call where we explore a small pilot project, maybe a specific SME segment or product type, like rooftop solar?”*
  - *“Who else internally would you recommend I speak to, to further validate this?”*
- End calmly and positively, leaving a clear action plan.

## Understanding the Broader Context (Strategically for ProCredit)

**Key context elements you must uncover and align with during discussion:**

1. **Growth Mandate**  
   - Do they have explicit targets around green lending volume growth or SME market penetration?
   - Your solution must demonstrably support these internal KPIs.

2. **Pain of Operational Complexity**  
   - Are their internal processes too costly or slow, causing inefficiency or preventing them from handling small loans profitably?
   - Clearly position your tool as significantly reducing their internal overhead.

3. **Risk & Compliance**  
   - Do they face regulatory pressures or ESG reporting challenges?
   - Frame Veridian as directly helping them meet new EU/EBA green-lending recommendations or labels effortlessly.

4. **Competitive Advantage**  
   - Are they facing competitive threats from other banks or fintech lenders in Eastern Europe?
   - Position Veridian as an immediate strategic differentiator—"You’ll lead your competitors by months or years."


## Tactical Selling Points

**Three strongest selling points to articulate clearly:**

1. **Rapid SME Onboarding & Increased Loan Volume**  
   - *"Veridian simplifies and standardizes SME green loan applications, directly boosting your pipeline and profitability, turning unprofitable small deals into profitable ones."*

2. **Compliance & ESG Reporting Simplified**  
   - *"By standardizing compliance data and eligibility checks, Veridian ensures loans effortlessly meet upcoming EU/EBA green loan labels and ESG reporting requirements."*

3. **Low Integration Risk & Cost**  
   - *"We’ve deliberately designed the platform to be quick to pilot and require minimal integration—so you can validate impact quickly with limited upfront risk or commitment."*
