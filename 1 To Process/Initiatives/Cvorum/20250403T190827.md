Below is a **structured checklist** of the **key data points** and **internal processes** you’d ideally gather from ProCredit (or any partner bank) to **refine and expand your prototype**. You can **package these questions** into a concise document (like a Google Doc or PDF) that the Head of Corporate Strategy can **forward internally** for answers. It shows you’re organized, serious, and aware of what’s needed to **tailor** your pilot to their realities.

1. **Typical SME Loan Amounts**  
   - **Average** green loan size and typical **range** (e.g., €10k–€150k).

## **Tips for Presenting This Checklist**

- **Format** it into a **sleek, user-friendly doc**: consistent headings, bullet points, and **brief descriptions** under each heading.  
- Emphasize that **not all questions** require immediate answers—some are for deeper discussion.  
- Offer to **prioritize** the most critical items (e.g., SME loan data, typical application process) if they can’t answer all at once.  
- Confirm a timeline: “We’d appreciate any initial responses within 1–2 weeks to refine our prototype.”  
- Keep it **concise**—2–3 pages max. They’ll appreciate brevity.

## **Closing Thought**

Providing a well-structured **data questionnaire** or “requirements gathering” doc demonstrates **professionalism** and **ease**. You’re showing that you **understand** banking processes and **only** want the relevant info, not to pry aimlessly. In turn, you’ll get the insights needed to make your pilot **100% aligned** with ProCredit’s realities—key to winning their trust. Good luck!
