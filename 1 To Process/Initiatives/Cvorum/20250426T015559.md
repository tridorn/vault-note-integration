You should have said:  
**“I need exact clarity: what is EBITDA? Is it cash? Is it profit? If not, what? And given that, what type of companies should Eupator acquire? Should we optimize for EBITDA, free cash flow, gross margins—or something else entirely? Give me a rational target profile.”**

Here’s the precise answer:

---

# **What is EBITDA?**

**EBITDA = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.**

- It measures **operating profitability**—how much a company earns from its core operations before financing and accounting "adjustments."
- **It is not cash flow**.
- **It is not real profit** either.
- **It is an approximation** of operating cash generation *before* big non-cash charges (like depreciation) and before debt/tax burdens.

| Think of EBITDA as: | Not: |
|---------------------|------|
| *“How much profit the business engine makes before external factors cut into it.”* | True cash in bank |
| *“If I bought this machine, how much raw output does it have?”* | Net income or net cash flow |

---

# **Why use EBITDA at all?**

Because **for buyouts**, especially in Mittelstand or SME deals:
- Owners often have messy finances (family salaries, perks, non-business expenses) — EBITDA "cleans" the view.
- Debt providers (banks) lend against EBITDA multiples because it proxies operating strength.
- Valuation multiples (4–6× EBITDA) standardize across industries.

BUT:
> *You must always adjust EBITDA into "Adjusted EBITDA"—removing distortions (non-recurring revenue, family expenses, etc.).*

# **Is EBITDA the same as cash flow?**  
**No.**

| Dimension | EBITDA | Cash Flow |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Working capital changes (inventory, accounts receivable) | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Included |
| Capital expenditures (machines, servers) | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Subtracted |
| Debt service (interest, principal repayment) | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Subtracted |
| Real tax payments | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Subtracted |

**Real cash flow** =  
EBITDA  
− CapEx  
− Changes in Working Capital  
− Interest  
− Taxes  
+ Other adjustments (grants, subsidies, etc.)

**→ Always run a cash conversion test after seeing EBITDA.**

# **Which companies should Eupator target?**

Given all this, you must optimize for:

| Criterion | Target value | Why |
|-----------|--------------|----|
| **EBITDA margin** | >15 % of revenue | Indicates real pricing power or operating efficiency |
| **Cash conversion ratio** (Free Cash Flow / EBITDA) | >65 % | High conversion = low hidden CapEx or working capital traps |
| **CapEx intensity** (CapEx / EBITDA) | <20 % | If CapEx is too high, you buy an endless money pit |
| **Working capital efficiency** (DSO/Inventory/DPO) | Tight cycles (AR < 45 days) | Slow receivables destroy your cash base |
| **Revenue resilience** | Non-cyclical, repeatable | To survive downturns without massive cash burn |

---

# **Concrete target company profile for Eupator acquisitions**

| Dimension | Ideal profile |
|-----------|---------------|
| Size | €2–10 m EBITDA (before adjustments) |
| Industry | B2B service, light manufacturing, specialty SaaS (horizontal software for SMEs) |
| Revenue model | Recurring or highly sticky repeat customer base |
| CapEx | Light (office equipment, light vehicles, software licenses) — NOT heavy plants or machinery |
| Customer concentration | No client >20 % of revenue |
| Growth | Steady (5–10 % organic) is fine; no need for hypergrowth |
| Geography | DACH / Nordics first (legal clarity, cultural proximity) |
| Succession pain | Owner aged >55, no heir visible, cares about legacy continuity |
| Financial structure | Low existing debt (<2× EBITDA leverage) |

---

# **Warning signs (companies you should avoid)**

| Red flag | Why it kills you |
|----------|------------------|
| EBITDA margin < 10 % | No operating buffer; small shocks = cash crisis |
| High CapEx needs | EBITDA will overstate real free cash; cash bleed hidden |
| Customer concentration >30 % | One lost customer collapses the firm |
| Heavy working capital | Ties up cash in inventory or late receivables |
| No financial reporting discipline | Means bigger forensic accounting costs in DD |

---

# **Summary: Understand EBITDA this way**

- **EBITDA is a starting point, not an end point**.  
- It tells you if the *engine runs*.  
- Cash flow tells you if the *car moves after gas and repairs*.  
- Always model adjusted EBITDA → Free Cash Flow bridge before buying.

Would you like me to also draft a **one-page acquisition filter checklist** you can use for every deal screening call?  
It would help automate fast "no" decisions before wasting time on bad targets. (Highly recommended.)
