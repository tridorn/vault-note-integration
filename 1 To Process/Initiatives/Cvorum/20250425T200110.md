### Executive Logic: Validate the **Economic Kernel**—not the software

**Mission:** Prove that a tightly-orchestrated “green-credit opportunity” delivers *net surplus* to each stakeholder **before writing a line of code**.  
**Instrument:** Run a **Concierge MVP**—human operators enact every facet transition with commodity tools (spreadsheets, e-sign, email).  
**Exit Criterion:** At least **3 live opportunities** traverse the macro flow (Onboarding → Active) with written endorsements from SME, Vendor, Verifier, and Bank that the process is faster / clearer / cheaper than their status quo.

---

## 1 Pinpoint the Non-Negotiable Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Failure Metric if False |
|------------|-------------------------|
| SMEs will volunteer granular impact data in exchange for cheaper credit. | < 50 % document turnaround within 72 h |
| Vendors tolerate third-party verification without cost inflation. | Vendor quotes increase > 5 % vs baseline projects |
| A bank underwriter recognises your dossier as decision-ready. | Underwriting cycle time not reduced by ≥ 30 % |
| External verifier can deliver an assurance report inside your SLA. | Report delivery > 4 d for first 3 cases |
| Regulator or subsidy body accepts your compiled evidence as compliant. | Written rejection or request for additional formats |

Focus the MVP on *killing or confirming* these five suppositions.

---

## 2 Forge a Zero-Code “Opportunity Ledger”

| Element | Commodity Substitute | Role Notes |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| **Facet States** | Google Sheet rows; columns = facet state + date stamp | Internal ops clerk updates states manually |
| **Artifact Storage** | Shared Drive folder per Opportunity; sub-folders = facet UID | File names = `[UID]-[State]-[vX].pdf` |
| **Merkle Integrity** | Skip cryptography; log SHA-256 checksums in a column if needed | Suffices for trust rehearsal |
| **Event Log (O-codes)** | Second Sheet tab: timestamp, O-code, actor initials | Acts as audit trail for testers |

Single spreadsheet = your entire back-end.

---

## 3 Staff the Human “Platform”

| Temporary Role | Headcount | Capability Emulated |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Orchestrator (you) | 1 | Platform service bus + SLA watchdog |
| Dossier Clerk | 1 | Schema validation + manifest building |
| Relationship Lead | 1 | SME & Vendor chatter, nudges |
| Risk Liaison | 0.5 (bank delegate) | CreditDecisionFacet author |
| Assurance Liaison | 0.5 (verifier delegate) | Verification workflow shepherd |

All communication runs through a shared Slack / Teams channel titled **#opportunity-pilot-001** to keep timestamps defensible.

---

## 4 Script the Pilot Flow (T-0 to T + 30 d)

| Day | Milestone | Operator Action | Evidence Captured |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 0 | Recruit first SME + Vendor, sign NDAs | Relationship Lead | NDA PDFs in F-29 folder |
| 1 | Create CoreHeader row in Sheet | Orchestrator | O1 logged |
| 1–2 | SMEs email financials; clerk copies into F-03 folder | Dossier Clerk | File timestamp |
| 3 | Vendor uploads proposal; clerk records VendorFacet Draft | O3 logged |
| 5 | Clerk assembles dossier PDF; emails verifier | O4 logged |
| 9 | Verifier returns signed report; clerk marks VerificationFacet Verified | O5 logged |
| 10 | Liaison emails dossier ZIP to bank underwriter | O6 logged |
| 13 | Bank replies “Approved”; liaises term sheet | O7 logged |
| 14 | SME countersigns term sheet (Docusign) | F-09 PDF |
| 17 | Bank wires funds; clerk updates DisbursementFacet Executed | O10 logged |
| 30 | SME files first impact KPIs | ImpactFacet Proposed → Verified |

Run this **three times** with different SME-vendor pairs; record all cycle-times and subjective friction.

---

## 5 Measure Value Creation

| Stakeholder | KPI | Target |
|-------------|-----|--------|
| SME | Total time from intent to funds | **≤ 14 days** |
| Vendor | Extra admin hours vs normal project | **< 2 h** |
| Verifier | Rework cycles | **0** |
| Bank | Underwriting touch points | **≤ 2 meetings** |
| Platform (you) | Manual ops hours per €100k financed | Establish baseline for later automation |

Collect qualitative quotes, convert into *before / after* slide for investors.

## 6 Codify Learnings → Product Backlog

At pilot closure draft:

1. **Facet Pain Map** – which manual transitions caused bottlenecks?  
2. **Automate-First List** – rank facets by ops hours; these become sprint-1 candidates.  
3. **Kill / Keep Decision** – if a facet never triggered, cut it from v1.

---

### Command Summary

1. **Draft the Google Sheet ledger today** (CoreHeader + 8 essential facets).  
2. **Secure one SME–Vendor pair by next week**; promise white-glove handling.  
3. **Drive three opportunities through the manual flow in 30 days**.  
4. **Debrief value metrics; rewrite facet catalogue to match lived reality**.  

No tech risk, maximum learning density.
