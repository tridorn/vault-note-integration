Always have a second person accompanying the pitch, writing a log of the session and key takeaways. Bring a mobile printer and print that after. Also bring a preprinted summary of our company (I very much encourage you to take it with you, even if you thought that we absolutely sucked. Even if it's just for the purpose to bring up as a case of not how to do it like "look at these fellas, am I right haha")
