Understood. I’ll research ProCredit Bank’s operations in Eastern Europe and the Balkans to identify strategic pain points or innovation gaps you could solve for them. The goal will be to craft a tailored offer that addresses a problem they likely face but cannot solve efficiently themselves.

I’ll look at:
- Their regional focus, business model, and digital infrastructure.
- Their positioning in SME finance, sustainability, or digital banking.
- Public statements, reports, or weaknesses that point to areas where a fast-moving initiative like yours could help.

Expect a strategic problem-solution proposal shortly.

## 1. ProCredit’s Regional Operational Profile in Eastern Europe and the Balkans  
ProCredit Bank is part of a German-led development-oriented banking group operating across Southeastern and Eastern Europe. The group has fully owned subsidiary banks in countries including **Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, Georgia,** as well as others like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Moldova, etc ([ProCredit Holding - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProCredit_Holding#:~:text=Name%20%20Ownership%20%20Reference,11)) ([ProCredit Holding - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProCredit_Holding#:~:text=ProCredit%20Bank%20Romania%20%20100%C2%A0,15)).  Its core mission is to serve as a **“Hausbank” for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)** in these markets, providing loans, deposits, payment services and trade finance to support local business growth ([Q2 2024 Interim report](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Q2-2024-Interim-report.pdf#:~:text=We%20aim%20to%20be%20the,also%20support%20our%20clients%20in)). ProCredit emphasizes **socially responsible banking** – it was founded as a development-focused institution – and has a strong focus on financing productive investment (e.g. agriculture, local production) and **green projects** in its regions of operation ([ProCredit Holding - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProCredit_Holding#:~:text=The%20ProCredit%20Holding%20is%20the,socially%20responsible%20banking)). In addition to its SME focus, ProCredit also pursues **direct digital banking for private clients**, targeting the growing middle class with online accounts and services instead of a large branch network ([ProCredit Holding - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProCredit_Holding#:~:text=The%20group%E2%80%99s%20core%20business%20consists,1)) ([Q2 2024 Interim report](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Q2-2024-Interim-report.pdf#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20serving%20SMEs%2C,part%20of%20the%20business%20strategy)). This profile – a niche SME lender with a digital retail strategy – defines their operations in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

## 2. Key Focus Areas and Strategic Objectives  
**Leading SME Bank and “Hausbank” Relationships:** ProCredit’s primary strategic objective is to solidify its position as the leading bank for SMEs in its region while maintaining close, long-term relationships. It aims to be the first point of contact for SME clients’ financial needs, offering not just credit but also advice, international payments, and support for long-term investments ([Q2 2024 Interim report](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Q2-2024-Interim-report.pdf#:~:text=We%20aim%20to%20be%20the,term%20investment)). The group’s 2024 strategy update explicitly states the goal to **“firmly position ourselves as the leading bank for MSMEs in our region”** ([ProCredit Management Board presents updated business strategy for a broadened ProCredit footprint on its second Capital Markets Day - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2024/03/25/procredit-management-board-presents-updated-business-strategy-for-a-broadened-procredit-footprint-on-its-second-capital-markets-day/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20want%20to%20firmly%20position,which%20we%20are%20present%2C%E2%80%9D%20elaborated)). This involves expanding its footprint in existing countries and reaching more small businesses (including smaller SMEs and start-ups) in order to **drive loan portfolio growth beyond €10 billion and achieve scale** ([ProCredit Management Board presents updated business strategy for a broadened ProCredit footprint on its second Capital Markets Day - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2024/03/25/procredit-management-board-presents-updated-business-strategy-for-a-broadened-procredit-footprint-on-its-second-capital-markets-day/#:~:text=,zero%20commitment%20through)) ([ProCredit Management Board presents updated business strategy for a broadened ProCredit footprint on its second Capital Markets Day - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2024/03/25/procredit-management-board-presents-updated-business-strategy-for-a-broadened-procredit-footprint-on-its-second-capital-markets-day/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20want%20to%20firmly%20position,which%20we%20are%20present%2C%E2%80%9D%20elaborated)). ProCredit plans to open new regional offices in some countries to better serve SMEs outside major cities, and to tailor more services for smaller enterprises – recognizing growth potential among businesses needing loans under ~€0.75 million ([ProCredit Management Board presents updated business strategy for a broadened ProCredit footprint on its second Capital Markets Day - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2024/03/25/procredit-management-board-presents-updated-business-strategy-for-a-broadened-procredit-footprint-on-its-second-capital-markets-day/#:~:text=To%20accelerate%20growth%20in%20the,stronger%20customer%20retention%20thanks%20to)).  

**Digital Direct Banking and Transformation:** In parallel, ProCredit is heavily focused on **digitalization** to serve private individuals and smaller businesses efficiently. The bank has eliminated almost all over-the-counter transactions, moving to 100% e-banking and card/ATM services in branches ([ProCredit Holding — New strategy targets ROE of 13–14% - Edison Group](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/new-strategy-targets-roe-of-13-14/33527/#:~:text=functionalities%20are%20developed%20in,cash%20transactions%20in%20its%20branches)). It launched **ProCredit Direct**, a digital banking platform for retail clients, to complement its SME business and offer convenient online accounts, payments, and lending – an effort fully rolled out by 2018 ([ProCredit Holding — New strategy targets ROE of 13–14% - Edison Group](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/new-strategy-targets-roe-of-13-14/33527/#:~:text=functionalities%20are%20developed%20in,and%20cash%20transactions%20in%20its)). The group prides itself on a **“state-of-the-art, secure customer experience”** through digital channels ([[PDF] Why responsible banking matters to us - ProCredit Holding](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ProCredit_Impact_Report_2020_L.pdf?t=1738084604#:~:text=Holding%20www.procredit,and%20maximise%20efficiency%20in)) and has continued to invest in IT. In fact, ProCredit historically developed its core banking software in-house (via its IT arm Quipu), but the updated strategy calls for **opening up to third-party tech solutions** so that new digital features can be adopted more quickly while Quipu focuses on core systems ([ProCredit Holding — New strategy targets ROE of 13–14% - Edison Group](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/new-strategy-targets-roe-of-13-14/33527/#:~:text=Despite%20its%20traditional%20approach%20to,of%20Hausbank%20for%20SMEs%20and)). This indicates a strategic push for faster digital innovation. By treating retail banking as primarily an online service, ProCredit seeks to grow its individual customer base without an extensive branch network, differentiating on convenience and transparency ([Q2 2024 Interim report](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Q2-2024-Interim-report.pdf#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20serving%20SMEs%2C,part%20of%20the%20business%20strategy)).  

**Green Finance and ESG Leadership:**  A cornerstone of ProCredit’s strategy is its **environmental and social mission.** The group has committed to sustainable banking practices, reflected in an aggressive expansion of its “green” loan portfolio. As of 2023, over **20% of its total loans are green loans**, financing things like energy efficiency upgrades and renewable energy projects – a target the bank had set and successfully reached ([Results Presentation for Analysts ProCredit Holding](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2022-Q4-Results-presentation_.pdf?t=1741941476#:~:text=Steady%20loan%20growth%2C%20deposit%20growth,term%20target%20achieved)). In fact, more than 50% of ProCredit’s loan growth in recent years has come from green financing ([Results Presentation for Analysts ProCredit Holding](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2022-Q4-Results-presentation_.pdf?t=1741941476#:~:text=Steady%20loan%20growth%2C%20deposit%20growth,term%20target%20achieved)). The bank’s sustainability orientation is reinforced by its shareholders (which include development banks like KfW and EBRD) and its joining of initiatives such as the **Net-Zero Banking Alliance**, committing to science-based targets for reducing carbon emissions ([Results Presentation for Analysts ProCredit Holding](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2022-Q4-Results-presentation_.pdf?t=1741941476#:~:text=risk%20due%20to%20ongoing%20war,Zero%20Standard)). Key strategic goals include continuing to grow green lending (management sees significant scope in Eastern Europe, where CO₂ per GDP is high) and helping clients transition to low-carbon operations ([ProCredit Holding — New strategy targets ROE of 13–14% - Edison Group](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/new-strategy-targets-roe-of-13-14/33527/#:~:text=focus%20on%20five%20SDGs%20as,reduce%20energy%20consumption%20by%20at)) ([ProCredit Holding — New strategy targets ROE of 13–14% - Edison Group](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/new-strategy-targets-roe-of-13-14/33527/#:~:text=to%20the%20prevention%20of%20air%2C,in%20its%20green%20loan%20book)). ProCredit also tracks social impact metrics (like job creation, gender equality) as part of its **impact-oriented approach**, aligning with several UN Sustainable Development Goals ([ProCredit Holding — New strategy targets ROE of 13–14% - Edison Group](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/new-strategy-targets-roe-of-13-14/33527/#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20its%20recently,which%20management)). In short, **ESG is not a side activity but central to ProCredit’s value proposition**, and the bank intends to remain a market leader in green finance in its countries.  

**Post-War Resilience and Reconstruction (Ukraine Focus):** The outbreak of war in Ukraine (one of ProCredit’s key markets) in 2022 posed a major challenge, and supporting Ukraine through and after the conflict has become a strategic priority. During the war, ProCredit Bank Ukraine has kept essential operations running despite the difficulties ([ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA: Agreement with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) expanded to further support the business activities of ProCredit Bank Ukraine - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2023/06/21/procredit-holding-ag-co-kgaa-agreement-with-the-multilateral-investment-guarantee-agency-miga-expanded-to-further-support-the-business-activities-of-procredit-bank-ukraine/#:~:text=Since%20the%20beginning%20of%20the,in%20a%20very%20challenging%20environment)). The group adopted a very cautious risk posture – essentially **halting new lending in conflict areas and focusing on existing clients** – to preserve asset quality during the fighting ([Q2 2024 Interim report](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Q2-2024-Interim-report.pdf#:~:text=end%20of%20our%20expectations%20for,2023%20Change)) ([Q2 2024 Interim report](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Q2-2024-Interim-report.pdf#:~:text=loan%20portfolio%20and%20deposit%20growth,8)). At the same time, ProCredit began laying groundwork for Ukraine’s eventual recovery. For example, it partnered with international institutions: the EBRD and EU provided risk-sharing guarantees to back new SME loans, and the World Bank’s MIGA expanded political risk insurance on ProCredit’s Ukraine exposures ([ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA: Agreement with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) expanded to further support the business activities of ProCredit Bank Ukraine - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2023/06/21/procredit-holding-ag-co-kgaa-agreement-with-the-multilateral-investment-guarantee-agency-miga-expanded-to-further-support-the-business-activities-of-procredit-bank-ukraine/#:~:text=The%20guarantee%20increase%20for%20ProCredit,support%20reconstruction%20after%20the%20war)) ([ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA: Agreement with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) expanded to further support the business activities of ProCredit Bank Ukraine - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2023/06/21/procredit-holding-ag-co-kgaa-agreement-with-the-multilateral-investment-guarantee-agency-miga-expanded-to-further-support-the-business-activities-of-procredit-bank-ukraine/#:~:text=The%20guarantee%20covers%20ProCredit%20Holding%E2%80%99s,to%20apply%20until%20December%202025)). Strategically, management is preparing to finance **post-war reconstruction and growth** in Ukraine. Viktor Ponomarenko, GM of ProCredit Ukraine, noted that the bank spent 2023 in “consolidation” but is now **“boosting lending and preparing for future growth”**, anticipating a surge of investment once conditions stabilize ([ProCredit Bank prepares for future growth in Ukraine - businessukraine.ua](https://businessukraine.ua/procredit-bank-prepares-for-future-growth-in-ukraine/#:~:text=conditions%2C%20providing%20crucial%20stability%20amid,%E2%80%9D)) ([ProCredit Bank prepares for future growth in Ukraine - businessukraine.ua](https://businessukraine.ua/procredit-bank-prepares-for-future-growth-in-ukraine/#:~:text=acknowledges%20this%20lack%20of%20predictability,%E2%80%9D)). ProCredit has even established a “**Ukraine Desk**” in Germany and a reciprocal “**German Desk**” in Ukraine to facilitate bilateral investment and help channel German capital into Ukrainian projects when the time comes ([ProCredit Bank prepares for future growth in Ukraine - businessukraine.ua](https://businessukraine.ua/procredit-bank-prepares-for-future-growth-in-ukraine/#:~:text=reconstruction%20initiatives%20in%20modern%20European,history)). This demonstrates a strategic initiative to leverage ProCredit’s presence in both Western Europe (Germany) and Ukraine to support what is expected to be one of the largest reconstruction efforts in modern Europe ([ProCredit Bank prepares for future growth in Ukraine - businessukraine.ua](https://businessukraine.ua/procredit-bank-prepares-for-future-growth-in-ukraine/#:~:text=the%20huge%20scope%20for%20postwar,initiatives%20in%20modern%20European%20history)) ([ProCredit Bank prepares for future growth in Ukraine - businessukraine.ua](https://businessukraine.ua/procredit-bank-prepares-for-future-growth-in-ukraine/#:~:text=reconstruction%20initiatives%20in%20modern%20European,history)). In summary, **navigating the Ukraine crisis and positioning for post-war reconstruction financing is a key strategic theme** for ProCredit in Eastern Europe.  

**Growth and Innovation Objectives:** Bolstered by a resilient 2023 (ROE ~12% despite war impacts ([ProCredit Holding — New strategy targets ROE of 13–14% - Edison Group](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/new-strategy-targets-roe-of-13-14/33527/#:~:text=ProCredit%20Holding%20,CIR%29%20of%20around%2057))), ProCredit’s updated strategy sets ambitious growth targets. The group intends to **double its client base** in the coming years and expand its loan portfolio to over €10 billion by broadening its footprint in current markets ([ProCredit Management Board presents updated business strategy for a broadened ProCredit footprint on its second Capital Markets Day - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2024/03/25/procredit-management-board-presents-updated-business-strategy-for-a-broadened-procredit-footprint-on-its-second-capital-markets-day/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20want%20to%20firmly%20position,which%20we%20are%20present%2C%E2%80%9D%20elaborated)) ([ProCredit Management Board presents updated business strategy for a broadened ProCredit footprint on its second Capital Markets Day - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2024/03/25/procredit-management-board-presents-updated-business-strategy-for-a-broadened-procredit-footprint-on-its-second-capital-markets-day/#:~:text=,zero%20commitment%20through)). Achieving this will require stepping up marketing and brand presence, and indeed ProCredit plans increased investments in **staff, IT and marketing to accelerate client acquisition** and deposit growth ([ProCredit Management Board presents updated business strategy for a broadened ProCredit footprint on its second Capital Markets Day - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2024/03/25/procredit-management-board-presents-updated-business-strategy-for-a-broadened-procredit-footprint-on-its-second-capital-markets-day/#:~:text=,commitment%20through%20targeted%20client%20engagement)). The bank explicitly wants to build a “strong reputation as an attractive bank for private individuals” alongside its MSME leadership ([ProCredit Management Board presents updated business strategy for a broadened ProCredit footprint on its second Capital Markets Day - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2024/03/25/procredit-management-board-presents-updated-business-strategy-for-a-broadened-procredit-footprint-on-its-second-capital-markets-day/#:~:text=,zero%20commitment%20through)), indicating more focus on retail product innovation and customer experience. It also underscores maintaining high portfolio quality and capital ratios, meaning growth must be sustainable. In essence, ProCredit’s strategic goals revolve around **scaling up (organically) without losing its niche strengths**: continuing digital transformation and ESG leadership, supporting post-conflict recovery, and extending its reach to more clients (especially smaller businesses and tech-savvy retail customers) in a flexible, low-cost way. 

## 3. Pain Points and Growth Bottlenecks  
Despite its successes, ProCredit faces several **operational pain points and innovation gaps** in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. These challenge the bank’s ability to grow and serve customers effectively, and they highlight areas where an outside incubator project could add value. Key identified issues include:

- **Limited Scale and Market Visibility:** In many of its countries, ProCredit remains a relatively small player, which constrains customer acquisition and scaling. For example, ProCredit Bank Romania holds **under 0.5% of banking sector assets**, reflecting a niche franchise in a highly competitive market ([Fitch Affirms Romanian ProCredit at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/fitch-affirms-romanian-procredit-at-bbb-outlook-stable-23-12-2024#:~:text=Stable%20www,share%20of%20sector%20assets%2C)). Similar patterns appear elsewhere (e.g. ~3% market share in Bosnia ([GEFF III REPower - ProCredit Bank](https://www.ebrd.com/work-with-us/projects/psd/55436.html#:~:text=GEFF%20III%20REPower%20,in%20terms%20of%20assets%2C))). This small scale can be a strategic disadvantage: with modest branch networks and limited mass-market advertising, ProCredit may struggle to attract new clients against larger, better-known banks. Fitch Ratings notes **“scale limitation challenges”** for ProCredit’s subsidiaries, citing their **small size and modest profitability** as weaknesses in markets like Romania ([ProCredit Bank S.A. - Fitch Ratings](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/procredit-bank-sa-13-02-2025#:~:text=The%20bank%27s%20small%20size%2C%20modest,Romanian%20ProCredit%20Bank%20at)). The bank often relies on funding from international financial institutions and its parent to fuel lending (loans-to-deposits was ~100% in some units) ([ProCredit Bank S.A. - Fitch Ratings](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/procredit-bank-sa-13-02-2025#:~:text=The%20bank%27s%20small%20size%2C%20modest,Romanian%20ProCredit%20Bank%20at)), indicating that growing a local deposit base is an ongoing challenge. In short, **customer acquisition and brand awareness** are pain points – ProCredit needs to reach more SMEs and individuals, but its niche positioning and conservative marketing historically limited its penetration.  

- **Digital User Experience Gaps:**  While ProCredit champions digital banking, it has faced **user experience shortcomings** that impede customer satisfaction and growth. A striking example came from ProCredit Bank Georgia’s online banking a few years ago: the mobile app was so unwieldy that fully **50% of all calls to the bank’s contact center were from clients struggling with the app’s interface**, consuming support resources that could have gone to advisory or sales ([How We Improved Internet Banking for ProCredit | Artkai ](https://artkai.io/blog/how-artkai-created-a-new-internet-banking-experience-for-procredit-bank-georgia#:~:text=,application%20that%20would%20cover%20all)). Customer feedback was blunt – users compared the old mobile banking experience to “Windows 98” in reviews, complaining that it was outdated and barely worth the phone storage space ([How We Improved Internet Banking for ProCredit | Artkai ](https://artkai.io/blog/how-artkai-created-a-new-internet-banking-experience-for-procredit-bank-georgia#:~:text=through%20the%20interface.%20,hours%20on%20the%20maintenance)). Moreover, the bank was maintaining three separate semi-functional apps instead of one, causing confusion and wasted IT effort ([How We Improved Internet Banking for ProCredit | Artkai ](https://artkai.io/blog/how-artkai-created-a-new-internet-banking-experience-for-procredit-bank-georgia#:~:text=their%20phone%20space.%20,the%20bank%20to%20lose%20money)). This **fragmented, clunky digital UX** was clearly a pain point, prompting ProCredit to overhaul its platforms. Although the group has since modernized many digital services (e.g. introducing a unified app, instant payments and online onboarding as noted in Bulgaria in 2024 ([Beyond Sensationalism: In 2024, ProCredit Bank transformed the way we do business – BG Advise](https://www.bgadvise.eu/blog/beyond-sensationalism-in-2024-procredit-bank-transformed-the-way-we-do-business#:~:text=ProCredit%20Bank%20has%20taken%20a,offered%20without%20any%20hidden%20conditions)) ([Beyond Sensationalism: In 2024, ProCredit Bank transformed the way we do business – BG Advise](https://www.bgadvise.eu/blog/beyond-sensationalism-in-2024-procredit-bank-transformed-the-way-we-do-business#:~:text=Innovation%20for%20businesses))), **UX and digital feature gaps remain an area of concern**. ProCredit’s value proposition for private clients hinges on convenient online banking; any shortcomings here directly hurt its ability to retain and attract customers. Ensuring a smooth, modern digital experience is an ongoing challenge, especially as customer expectations (set by fintechs and larger banks) keep rising.  

- **Challenges Serving Displaced Populations and Remittance Flows:** Given its regional footprint, ProCredit operates in several countries with significant **diaspora and migrant movements**, and this has introduced both operational strain and unmet client needs. The war in Ukraine dramatically highlighted this: **millions of Ukrainians fled abroad or became internally displaced**, including many skilled workers and bank clients ([ProCredit Bank joins the Charter on Financial Inclusion and Reintegration of Veterans | ProCredit Bank](https://procreditbank.com.ua/en/news/hartiya#:~:text=The%20war%20has%20led%20to,Ukraine%20and%20find%20gainful%20employment)). This sudden population shift meant **loss of local customers and staff** for banks, and a pressing need to support customers now living outside their home country. ProCredit has acknowledged that future economic resilience for Ukraine hinges on encouraging citizens (and veterans) to return and rebuild ([ProCredit Bank joins the Charter on Financial Inclusion and Reintegration of Veterans | ProCredit Bank](https://procreditbank.com.ua/en/news/hartiya#:~:text=The%20war%20has%20led%20to,Ukraine%20and%20find%20gainful%20employment)). In Southeastern Europe too, migration is common – countries like Kosovo, Albania, and Moldova rely heavily on remittances from citizens working abroad ([ProCredit Holding — New strategy targets ROE of 13–14% - Edison Group](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/new-strategy-targets-roe-of-13-14/33527/#:~:text=stage%20of%20economic%20development%20and,eg%20Kosovo%2C%20Albania%2C%20Moldova)). For ProCredit, this presents a service gap: traditional international transfers can be costly and slow, and many diaspora clients resort to money transfer operators instead of banks. The bank has tried to cater to diaspora (for instance, ProCredit Kosovo offers “special services” for Kosovars abroad, including free in-country transfers and online account access ([ProCredit special services for the Kosovo diaspora - ProCredit Bank](https://procreditbank-kos.com/eng/news/procredit-special-services-for-the-kosovo-dia-1237/#:~:text=Kosovo%20nationals%20living%20abroad%2C%20ProCredit,with%20you%20wherever%20you%20live)) ([ProCredit special services for the Kosovo diaspora - ProCredit Bank](https://procreditbank-kos.com/eng/news/procredit-special-services-for-the-kosovo-dia-1237/#:~:text=If%20you%20still%20do%20not,time%20you%20are%20in%20Kosovo))). It also developed an internal system (ProPay) to enable faster, cheaper cross-border payments between ProCredit banks ([International payments | ProCredit Bank](https://www.procreditbank.rs/en/business/payments/international-payments#:~:text=ProPay)) ([International payments | ProCredit Bank](https://www.procreditbank.rs/en/business/payments/international-payments#:~:text=A%20unique%20international%20payments%20system,payments%20between%20ProCredit%20Bank%20clients)). **Despite these efforts, fully capturing regional remittance flows remains a limitation.** Many expatriate or displaced individuals are not integrated into ProCredit’s ecosystem, meaning the bank misses out on deposits and lending opportunities from this segment. In summary, **serving customers across borders – whether war refugees, labor migrants, or diaspora investors – is a pain point**, as it requires more flexible onboarding, cross-country interoperability, and tailored products that traditional banks (including ProCredit) have been slow to provide.

- **War-Related Risk and Portfolio Constraints:** The conflict in Ukraine has also exposed a strategic limitation in ProCredit’s otherwise balanced growth. Due to the war’s uncertainty, ProCredit had to severely **curtail lending in Ukraine**, effectively stalling portfolio growth there and focusing only on supporting existing clients in safer areas ([Q2 2024 Interim report](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Q2-2024-Interim-report.pdf#:~:text=end%20of%20our%20expectations%20for,2023%20Change)) ([Q2 2024 Interim report](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Q2-2024-Interim-report.pdf#:~:text=loan%20portfolio%20and%20deposit%20growth,8)). This cautious approach, while prudent, means ProCredit cannot capitalize on demand in Ukraine until stability returns. The war’s impact dragged down the group’s overall performance – in 2022 ProCredit’s profit was almost wiped out by heavy provisioning (≈€87m in war-related credit loss reserves), yielding a very low ROE of 1.9% ([Results Presentation for Analysts ProCredit Holding](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2022-Q4-Results-presentation_.pdf?t=1741941476#:~:text=Resilient%202022%20result%20driven%20by,off%20effects)). Thus, **geopolitical disruptions are a significant bottleneck**, and the bank is somewhat constrained in how quickly it can respond with new products or lending in crisis situations. It has to rely on external support (guarantees, IFI loans) to operate in such environments, which can take time to arrange ([ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA: Agreement with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) expanded to further support the business activities of ProCredit Bank Ukraine - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2023/06/21/procredit-holding-ag-co-kgaa-agreement-with-the-multilateral-investment-guarantee-agency-miga-expanded-to-further-support-the-business-activities-of-procredit-bank-ukraine/#:~:text=The%20guarantee%20increase%20for%20ProCredit,support%20reconstruction%20after%20the%20war)). In the interim, customer needs (e.g. financing for relocating businesses, credit for returning veterans, etc.) might evolve faster than the bank’s standard processes. This illustrates a broader pain point: **organizational agility**. Being relatively conservative and regulated (as a bank) can limit how quickly ProCredit innovates in response to shocks or new market demands. The bank’s own leadership has identified the need to **“significantly strengthen internal capacities [and] optimize processes”** to better serve smaller clients and respond to regional challenges ([ProCredit Management Board presents updated business strategy for a broadened ProCredit footprint on its second Capital Markets Day - PCH (EN)](https://www.procredit-holding.com/2024/03/25/procredit-management-board-presents-updated-business-strategy-for-a-broadened-procredit-footprint-on-its-second-capital-markets-day/#:~:text=To%20accelerate%20growth%20in%20the,stronger%20customer%20retention%20thanks%20to)). The question is whether those changes can happen fast enough.

In summary, ProCredit’s growth is hampered by **bottlenecks in customer acquisition (small market share), digital UX shortcomings, limited reach in serving diaspora/displaced clients, and the drag of conflict-related risks**. These pain points represent opportunities where a more flexible, tech-driven initiative could contribute solutions that the bank, due to its scale or structure, **finds difficult to tackle with speed**.

## 4. Problems an Incubator Initiative Could Tackle (and Why)  
Given the above context, a student-led incubator project could credibly focus on solving one of ProCredit’s pressing challenges in a nimble, innovative way. Such an initiative could operate outside the bank’s day-to-day constraints and deliver a prototype or pilot that addresses a known gap. Based on the identified pain points, **several promising problem-statements emerge:**

- **Enhancing Digital Banking UX and Customer Engagement:** One opportunity is to tackle ProCredit’s **digital user experience limitations** head-on. The problem to solve: *“How might we provide ProCredit’s private and SME clients with a more intuitive, seamless digital banking experience that reduces support frictions and attracts new users?”*  An incubator team could, for example, redesign and streamline the mobile banking interface or develop a new personal finance management feature. The rationale is clear: ProCredit’s own data showed poor UX leading to excessive support calls and negative reviews ([How We Improved Internet Banking for ProCredit | Artkai ](https://artkai.io/blog/how-artkai-created-a-new-internet-banking-experience-for-procredit-bank-georgia#:~:text=,application%20that%20would%20cover%20all)) ([How We Improved Internet Banking for ProCredit | Artkai ](https://artkai.io/blog/how-artkai-created-a-new-internet-banking-experience-for-procredit-bank-georgia#:~:text=through%20the%20interface.%20,hours%20on%20the%20maintenance)), which likely hinders customer acquisition. As ProCredit doubles down on direct banking, it **needs modern UX/UI** but may be burdened by legacy systems and in-house IT capacity. A fresh external perspective (e.g. UX research and rapid prototyping by students) could deliver a solution faster. Indeed, ProCredit’s strategy now explicitly welcomes third-party tech collaboration to complement its IT core ([ProCredit Holding — New strategy targets ROE of 13–14% - Edison Group](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/new-strategy-targets-roe-of-13-14/33527/#:~:text=Despite%20its%20traditional%20approach%20to,of%20Hausbank%20for%20SMEs%20and)). By demonstrating a revamped app or an innovative customer engagement tool, the incubator can solve a pain point the bank **knows it has but might not fix quickly internally**. Better digital UX would improve client satisfaction and help ProCredit compete with fintech-savvy rivals in the region.

- **Capturing Diaspora and Remittance Flows:** Another high-impact area is improving services for the **diaspora and cross-border customers**. The problem statement: *“How can ProCredit better connect and serve the millions of East European expatriates sending money home, turning remittance outflows into retained savings and investments?”* An incubator project could develop a **fintech solution for low-cost remittances** or a multi-country banking app tailored to migrant users. For instance, a platform that links a ProCredit account in Germany with one in Ukraine or Serbia, enabling instant transfers (leveraging ProCredit’s ProPay network ([International payments | ProCredit Bank](https://www.procreditbank.rs/en/business/payments/international-payments#:~:text=ProPay))) and easy bill payments for families back home. While ProCredit has some diaspora offerings (e.g. special accounts for Kosovars abroad ([ProCredit special services for the Kosovo diaspora - ProCredit Bank](https://procreditbank-kos.com/eng/news/procredit-special-services-for-the-kosovo-dia-1237/#:~:text=Kosovo%20nationals%20living%20abroad%2C%20ProCredit,with%20you%20wherever%20you%20live))), a student team could bring fresh ideas like integrating mobile wallets or partnerships with diaspora organizations to onboard users abroad. The need is evident: economies like Kosovo, Albania, and Moldova are **“highly reliant on remittances”**, yet many migrants use non-bank channels ([ProCredit Holding — New strategy targets ROE of 13–14% - Edison Group](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/new-strategy-targets-roe-of-13-14/33527/#:~:text=stage%20of%20economic%20development%20and,eg%20Kosovo%2C%20Albania%2C%20Moldova)). By solving this, ProCredit could gain loyal customers on both sides of the remittance stream (sender and receiver), boosting its deposit base and fee income. This is a capability the bank currently lacks at scale – and it’s *hard for a traditional bank to innovate quickly on* (due to compliance, legacy tech, etc.). A focused incubator solution could prototype a compliant but user-friendly remittance service (perhaps using digital IDs, or leveraging its EU presence for passporting services) much faster. This addresses both a **social need (cheaper, easier money transfers for migrants)** and a strategic need for ProCredit (capturing a share of an untapped market).

- **Financial Inclusion for Displaced Persons and War Veterans:** In light of the Ukraine war and regional conflicts, ProCredit has committed to supporting **displaced populations and veteran reintegration**, but concrete solutions are needed. The incubator could frame the problem as: *“What tools or programs could help reintegrate war veterans and displaced people into the financial system, easing their access to banking and employment?”* A possible project might be developing a **“veteran-friendly” digital onboarding and credit scoring system** that recognizes non-traditional proof of identity or employment (since many veterans or refugees lack recent credit history or documentation). It could also involve a financial literacy and job networking portal targeted at those returning from military service. ProCredit Ukraine has signed onto a national Charter to improve financial inclusion for veterans, pledging to make services more accessible and HR policies more inclusive ([ProCredit Bank joins the Charter on Financial Inclusion and Reintegration of Veterans | ProCredit Bank](https://procreditbank.com.ua/en/news/hartiya#:~:text=By%20joining%20the%20Charter%2C%20ProCredit,services%20for%20all%20clients%20equally)) ([ProCredit Bank joins the Charter on Financial Inclusion and Reintegration of Veterans | ProCredit Bank](https://procreditbank.com.ua/en/news/hartiya#:~:text=In%20particular%2C%20in%20order%20to,will%20introduce%20initiatives%20designed%20to)). However, implementing these ideals may be non-trivial – e.g., creating PTSD-sensitive workplaces or equal-opportunity lending frameworks. An external student-led initiative could pilot, say, a mentorship app that connects veteran entrepreneurs with business loans and guidance (with ProCredit as a partner), or develop an AI chatbot that helps displaced customers navigate banking services in their new country/language. The rationale is that **ProCredit “needs but cannot easily build” tailored solutions for this emerging customer segment**. The war caused an exodus of millions and the bank itself notes that encouraging their return is key for economic resilience ([ProCredit Bank joins the Charter on Financial Inclusion and Reintegration of Veterans | ProCredit Bank](https://procreditbank.com.ua/en/news/hartiya#:~:text=The%20war%20has%20led%20to,Ukraine%20and%20find%20gainful%20employment)). By devising a flexible fintech approach (perhaps in collaboration with NGOs or government programs), the incubator can help ProCredit address a socially critical issue while expanding its future customer base among returnees. This problem area sits at the intersection of **ESG and market development**, which aligns perfectly with ProCredit’s mission-driven ethos.

- **SME Green Finance Innovation:** A further potential focus is innovating around **green finance for SMEs**, bridging a gap between ProCredit’s sustainability goals and on-the-ground SME capabilities. The problem could be framed as: *“How can we enable more local businesses to undertake green investments, and streamline the process of qualifying for green loans?”* ProCredit’s strategic focus on green lending is strong – 20% of its portfolio is already green ([Results Presentation for Analysts ProCredit Holding](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2022-Q4-Results-presentation_.pdf?t=1741941476#:~:text=Steady%20loan%20growth%2C%20deposit%20growth,term%20target%20achieved)) – but one bottleneck is the **capacity of SMEs to identify and implement eligible green projects**. A student incubator could develop a solution like a **“Green Advisory” digital tool** that audits a business’s energy usage (via an app or IoT data) and then recommends upgrades (solar panels, efficient machinery, etc.) along with a pre-approved financing offer from ProCredit. This would tackle the pain point of SMEs often lacking know-how to propose green projects. It also helps ProCredit deploy its green funds more effectively, supporting its net-zero commitment. The bank itself has been **“developing tools to facilitate ESG impact and reporting”** ([Results Presentation for Analysts ProCredit Holding](https://www.procredit-holding.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2022-Q4-Results-presentation_.pdf?t=1741941476#:~:text=risk%20due%20to%20ongoing%20war,Zero%20Standard)); a nimble external project could complement this by focusing on client-side engagement (making it easier for clients to go green). Since ProCredit’s internal IT is focused on core banking, an incubator team could quickly prototype a user-friendly app or web platform that the bank alone might take much longer to roll out. Solving this problem benefits ProCredit through **higher green loan uptake** and positive impact metrics, and it addresses a broader innovation gap in the market (connecting SMEs with sustainable tech solutions).

Each of these suggested problems comes with a clear **rationale tied to ProCredit’s needs**: they target areas where ProCredit has a strategic interest but limited in-house agility or bandwidth to innovate rapidly. By focusing on one of these pain points, a student-led incubator can deliver a credible solution that ProCredit could pilot. For example, improving the digital UX directly addresses customer complaints and would strengthen ProCredit’s hand in attracting the very retail clients it seeks to grow. Tackling remittances or displaced-person banking leverages the bank’s unique regional footprint to solve a problem no single local bank can easily solve alone – something a cross-border initiative is well suited for. And creating tools for veterans or green finance would burnish ProCredit’s social responsibility credentials while opening new client segments, which the bank **“is guided not only by moral principles, but also by…high international standards of inclusion”** ([ProCredit Bank joins the Charter on Financial Inclusion and Reintegration of Veterans | ProCredit Bank](https://procreditbank.com.ua/en/news/hartiya#:~:text=employment)). In essence, the incubator could function as an **“innovation fast-track”** for ProCredit: addressing a real pain point (validated by reports and feedback) with a fresh solution that the bank can’t develop as quickly by itself, thus delivering both business value and positive social impact. Each problem outlined above is squarely in the zone of “important, yet not quickly solvable internally” for ProCredit – making it an ideal target for a creative, agile student project to take on.

These examples illustrate the current challenges and opportunities that a targeted incubator project could effectively address for ProCredit in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.
