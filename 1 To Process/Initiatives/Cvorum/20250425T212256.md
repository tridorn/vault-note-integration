### The Eight “North-Star” Metrics  
*If these eight numbers move in the right direction, every stakeholder’s P&L or mandate improves—and your platform’s value proposition becomes self-evident.*

| # | Metric (symbol) | Precise Definition & Formula | Baseline Source | Why It Matters |
|---|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **1** | **Intent-to-Cash Cycle Time** (⟨ **T<sub>ITC</sub>** ⟩) | Calendar days from SME’s first loan intent to funds settled in its account.<br>Formula: *date_disbursed − date_intent_signed* | SME & bank document timestamps | Time compression is the headline benefit; every actor feels it. |
| **2** | **Document Touch Count** (⟨ **D<sub>touch</sub>** ⟩) | Total unique “send/receive/edit” actions executed across all parties for one deal. | Email logs, folder audit | Proxy for administrative friction you aim to crush. |
| **3** | **Verification Turn-Around** (⟨ **T<sub>verif</sub>** ⟩) | Hours between dossier-ready event and signed assurance report.<br>*date_report_signed − date_O4* | Verifier SLA logs | Tests the feasibility of your 3rd-party audit loop. |
| **4** | **Underwriting Re-work Rate** (⟨ **R<sub>uw</sub>** ⟩) | % of submitted dossiers that require ≥1 additional info request from bank.<br>*rework_cases / total_cases* | Bank workflow export | Directly reflects dossier completeness and credibility. |
| **5** | **All-in Loan Acquisition Cost** (⟨ **C<sub>acq</sub>** ⟩) | Sum of explicit fees **+** internal labour cost (hours × € rate) per €100 k financed. | SME invoices + your ops time sheet | Turns “friction” into euros—easy ROI narrative. |
| **6** | **Risk Delta** (⟨ **Δ PD** ⟩) | Change in bank’s modelled Probability-of-Default after factoring verified impact and vendor data. | Bank risk model output | Shows whether richer data actually lowers credit capital cost. |
| **7** | **Verified CO₂-e Reduction** (⟨ **CO₂<sub>ver</sub>** ⟩) | Tonnes of CO₂-equivalent savings validated by third-party per €100 k loan. | ImpactFacet + Verification report | Links green thesis to hard climate benefit—compelling for regulators. |
| **8** | **Ops Hours per Opportunity** (⟨ **H<sub>ops</sub>** ⟩) | Aggregate human hours your team spends shepherding one deal. | Time-tracking | Guides automation roadmap and margin calculus. |

### How to Use Them in the MVP

1. **Pre-Pilot Baseline**  
   * Ask each actor for one recent deal’s numbers for T<sub>ITC</sub>, D<sub>touch</sub>, T<sub>verif</sub>, and C<sub>acq</sub>.  
   * Pull bank’s historical PD and CO₂ assumptions for similar assets.

2. **During Concierge Run**  
   * Log every timestamp and touch in the Google Sheet.  
   * Track your own hours with a timer.

3. **Post-Pilot Delta Calculation**  
   ```
   Improvement_% =  (Baseline − Pilot) / Baseline × 100
   ```
   for metrics where “lower is better”, and vice versa for CO₂<sub>ver</sub>.

4. **Narrative Anchor**  
   * Lead the deck with **T<sub>ITC</sub> reduction** (speed), underline with **C<sub>acq</sub> saved €**, and close with **CO₂<sub>ver</sub> per €** (impact).  
   * Use R<sub>uw</sub> and Δ PD to persuade risk officers; H<sub>ops</sub> to reassure investors about scalability.

Focus ruthlessly on these eight; they form the quantifiable spine of your value story and are feasible to measure with nothing more sophisticated than timestamps, invoices, and a stopwatch.
