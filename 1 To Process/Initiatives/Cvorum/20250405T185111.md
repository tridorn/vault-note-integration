*“Web pitch” means translating your slide-based story into an immersive single-page or multi-section web experience. Instead of flipping slides in a meeting, you let viewers scroll and discover the pitch at their own pace—often enhanced by animations, interactive elements, and compelling visuals.*

Here’s how it typically works:

1. **Hero Section (Emotional Hook)**  
   - A bold, full-screen headline like *“Green Doesn’t Have to Be Hard—Or Slow.”*  
   - Subtext or tagline: *“Veridian: A simpler path to financing sustainable SME upgrades.”*  
   - A prominent CTA button: *“Explore the Opportunity”* (which scrolls the user down).

2. **Problem Spotlight**  
   - A striking visual or animation illustrating the **€1 Trillion Untapped** potential.  
   - Short copy that nails the frustration: *“Complex processes keep SMEs from tapping green loans; banks see small deals as unprofitable.”*  
   - Possibly animated stats: *“SMEs generate 50%+ of Europe’s GDP—yet struggle to secure green funds.”*

3. **Pain Points for SMEs & Banks**  
   - Split-screen layout: *“Red tape for SMEs”* on the left; *“Lost profit for banks”* on the right.  
   - Bullet points or short paragraphs describing the friction.  
   - Include a short anecdote or quote. Example: *“Our bakery needed 9 weeks and 12 forms for a simple solar upgrade.”*

4. **Our Solution (Show the Flow)**  
   - A **scroll-based animation** or simple interactive flow diagram of how Veridian compresses everything into a few steps.  
   - Key snippet: *“SME → Vendor Matching → Standardized Packet → Fast Bank Approval.”*  
   - A minimal sentence under each step, plus micro-animations or icons.

5. **Product Demo or Screenshot**  
   - In a web pitch, a short video clip or embedded interactive mockup is golden.  
   - Show how an SME enters data or sees instant ROI. Possibly a “Play Demo” button.  
   - Keep it succinct: a 30–60 second video or a static graphic showing the UI.

6. **Market Opportunity & Data**  
   - Use animated counters or bars to highlight the **€200B** SME green market by 2025.  
   - Show the time-savings: a timeline that shrinks from 6 weeks to 2 weeks.  
   - Crisp headings: *“Lower overhead. More green deals. Bigger impact.”*

7. **Pilot Success (Real or Projected)**  
   - Carousel of big numbers: *“25 projects financed,” “40% faster underwriting,” “9/10 satisfaction.”*  
   - If no real data, label them “Targets for Q2 Pilot” but present them visually like milestones.  
   - Possibly a testimonial snippet from a pilot partner or hypothetical SME user.

8. **Business Model**  
   - Short bullet or graphic showing 1–2% transaction fee + optional SaaS.  
   - Keep text minimal—maybe hover tooltips explaining further details.

9. **Team Section**  
   - Photo grid or horizontally scrolling “team reel.”  
   - One-liner bios for each founder and advisor.  
   - Potential “Contact” or “Connect on LinkedIn” buttons.

10. **Call to Action (Join Us)**  
   - Big final banner: *“Be the Bank that Leads the Green Revolution.”*  
   - Mention pilot or seed round.  
   - Embed a form or a scheduling widget: *“Ready to talk?”* → email capture, Calendly link, or direct contact details.

### **Why a Web Pitch?**
- **24/7 Access**: Stakeholders, potential investors, or bank partners can revisit your pitch at any time—no need to schedule a meeting or flip slides themselves.  
- **Interactive & Shareable**: A link can be passed around; viewers can explore in any order.  
- **Scalable**: As you gather traction (pilot data, new stats), it’s easy to update a web pitch.  

### **Implementation Notes**
- You could build it as:
  1. **Static Single-Page Site** (e.g., Astro or Next.js) with smooth scroll anchors and animated segments.  
  2. **Interactive Scrolly-Telling** (using libraries like GSAP, Framer Motion, or Swiper for carousels).  
  3. **Landing-Page-Style** with pinned sections that transform as you scroll.

- Keep each section minimal in text—just strong headlines, bullet highlights, or short paragraphs. Let visuals and data animations do the heavy lifting.

- **Critical**: Mobile-friendly design. Many decision-makers will open it on their phone.

### **In Practice:**
1. **Hero**: Full-screen quote or data-based punch.  
2. **Scrolling**: Problem → Pain → Veridian Flow → ROI/Data → Pilot → Business Model → Team → CTA.  
3. **Transitions**: Subtle fade-ins, slides, or parallax elements.  
4. **Finalize**: A bold CTA block with your contact details.

Think of it as an evolving “live deck” that offers extra engagement. If you have the time and resources, a web pitch can be more memorable than a static PDF—especially if you’re in front of forward-thinking stakeholders who appreciate a polished, modern presentation.
