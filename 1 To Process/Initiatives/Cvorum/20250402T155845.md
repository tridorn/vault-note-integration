## **Slide 1: Emotional Hook**

### **Slide Title:**  
**“Empowering Everyday Green Heroes”**

### **Visual:**  
- A **photo** of a friendly small business owner in front of their shop/farm/bakery – something that conveys local warmth and authenticity.  
- Possibly show a subtle green element (solar panels, or fresh produce).  

### **What You **Say** (Talking Points):**  
- “Imagine Mariya, who runs a local bakery in our region. She’s determined to cut down her energy costs and carbon footprint by installing an efficient oven and better insulation, but she has **no clue where to start**.  
- She spends days reading conflicting info, applying for small grants, getting stuck in endless forms, only to have banks say, *‘We’re not sure your project meets our green criteria.’*  
- **At GreenBridge**, we believe that people like Mariya—our everyday neighbors—should be able to go green **easily** and **sustainably**.”

**Time:** ~30–45 seconds

## **Slide 2: The Problem**

### **Slide Title:**  
**“SMEs Are Locked Out of Green Financing”**

### **Visual:**  
- A **simple infographic** or bullet chart showing key frustrations for SMEs. Minimal text.  

### **Possible Bullet Points (On Screen):**  
1. Complex eligibility & application processes  
2. Fragmented funding sources (banks, grants, etc.)  
3. No easy access to vetted vendors  
4. High transaction costs for smaller loans

*(Keep it very brief – no paragraphs!)*

### **What You **Say** (Talking Points):**  
- “Millions of small businesses across Eastern Europe and beyond want to invest in clean technology—like solar panels, energy-efficient machinery—but they quickly find the **process confusing and costly**.  
- Banks often can’t justify the **due diligence** for small loans; SMEs don’t have the time or money for **expensive consultants** to prove their project is green.  
- **As a result**, billions in potential clean investments stay on the sidelines, hurting both communities and banks that want more green lending.”

**Time:** ~1 minute

## **Slide 3: Our Solution**

### **Slide Title:**  
**“GreenBridge: A One-Stop Gateway to Green Finance”**

### **Minimal Slide Text:**  
- **Project Scoping**: Automated ROI & carbon reduction calculator  
- **Funding Marketplace**: Access to bank loans, grants, vendor financing  
- **Compliance & Monitoring**: Auto-generated green compliance docs, real-time tracking  

### **What You **Say** (Talking Points):**  
- “GreenBridge is a **digital aggregator**. SMEs log in, describe their project—or simply pick from a library of typical green upgrades—and instantly see estimated **savings** and **CO₂ reductions**.  
- Next, they’re matched with **relevant financing options**—like ProCredit’s green credit lines, or local subsidies.  
- We also help with **post-loan monitoring**, so banks see real results without extensive manual checks.  
- **In essence**, we cut the cost, time, and confusion for both SMEs and lenders so **everyone** can push forward on climate action.”

- This means **less friction** for your loan officers, **lower risk** (since the projects are pre-screened), and **more deals closed**.

## **Slide 5: Pilot Proposal**

### **Slide Title:**  
**“Let’s Pilot Together”**

  2. Integrate ProCredit’s green criteria in our platform  
  3. Launch to 50–100 SMEs as a test  
  4. Measure results, refine & scale  

### **What You **Say** (Talking Points):**  
- “We propose starting **small**: pick a specific type of project—like rooftop solar or efficient bakery ovens—and target 50 SMEs in your network.  
- We integrate your **green lending criteria** so that any applicant meets your documentation needs right away.  
- We measure how many successful loans we process, how satisfied the SMEs are, and how much time your team saves.  
- If it’s successful, we **expand** the pilot and incorporate more project categories. This approach is **low-risk, high-reward** for both of us.”

## **Language & Style**

- **Use English** throughout. It shows you’re **thinking globally** and polishes your presentation for an international standard.  
- Keep your **tone** warm, confident, and **collaborative**. You want them to feel **invited** into the mission, not pitched to.  
- Even in 1-on-1, a **small deck** can help them visually follow. If they prefer a discussion, show slides as reference, but stay conversational.

## **Final Tips for the 1-on-1 Setting**

1. **Establish a Warm Rapport**: Start by asking about **ProCredit’s** current green initiatives—show genuine interest.  
2. **Pause for Input**: After each slide, invite them to **comment or question** so it feels like a dialogue.  
3. **Offer Realistic Next Steps**: Possibly hand them a **simple 1-page pilot outline** they can take back to their colleagues.  
4. **Time Management**: If they have 10–15 minutes, keep your slides very concise—**no bullet overload**—and let them talk.

**Good luck** with your pitch! Balancing **professional visuals** and **human-centered storytelling** will demonstrate both your **international ambition** and your **local, social** focus.
