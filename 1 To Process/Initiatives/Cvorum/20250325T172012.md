**Your original “green loan enablement” idea is not just valid—it’s more necessary than you realized.** The research confirms: **this is a massively underserved yet heavily mandated space**, especially in Eastern Europe. You do **not** need to abandon it. What you must do now is **refine and reposition it**, based on the real terrain.

Let’s go step-by-step:

---

## **1. Reassess Your Position After the Research**

### **What the Landscape Shows:**
- There are **almost no integrated tools** that help SMEs plan green projects, check eligibility, and prepare financing packets—**especially not in Eastern Europe**.
- Banks like ProCredit are manually handling green loan assessments or relying on donor tools like EEQuest or GTS—**great tools, but siloed and poorly surfaced to SMEs.**
- ESG compliance tools like Greenomy are **targeted at banks**, not SMEs—and **are too complex or indirect for you to build around**.
- SMEs are **desperate for help**, as proven by the overwhelming interest in public grants (e.g. 1,400+ Balkan SMEs for one €10k grant window).

---

## **2. What You Should Definitely NOT Do**
- **Don’t build another ESG scoring tool.** That market is becoming saturated and favors well-capitalized players with data monopolies (Moody’s, S&P, Greenomy).
- **Don’t try to create an energy calculator from scratch**—use what’s already out there (e.g., EEQuest, GTS APIs) and **wrap it into a better UX and workflow**.
- **Don’t build a product just for ProCredit.** Build **with them** as a validation partner, not as your only customer.  
  You’re solving a market-wide bottleneck.

---

## **3. What You Should Build Now (Refined Version)**

### **GreenSME: A Pre-Financing Launcher for Sustainable SME Projects**
> **“An SME-facing web platform that helps businesses plan small green projects, assess their loan readiness, and auto-generate a financing-ready application packet for banks.”**

#### **Core Features**
- **Green Project Wizard**: step-by-step interface where SME owners select a goal (e.g. reduce energy cost), input facility data, and get a list of viable green improvements.
- **Savings & Eligibility Estimator**: based on tools like EEQuest, GTS, or public databases—wrapped in your own UX.
- **Auto-generated Loan Application Packet**:
  - Executive summary of project
  - Estimated impact (e.g. kWh saved, CO₂ reduction)
  - Tech list + vendor quote fields
  - PDF download or online link for banks
- **Bank Matching Module (Phase 2)**: connect SMEs with green lenders who support such projects (starting with ProCredit and expanding).

---

## **4. Why This Is the Right Move**
- **You avoid the ESG arms race**—you’re not building a rating agency. You’re the *preparation layer*.
- **You control your user**: SME first. Bank second.
- You start **simple, useful, and fast to test**.
- You are solving the #1 friction in green SME lending: *“I don’t know what to propose, how to quantify it, or how to convince the bank.”*

## **5. Your 30-Day Roadmap**
| Week | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Week 1** | Define 2–3 archetypal SME green projects (e.g. rooftop solar, energy-efficient machines). Do mock-ups of what info the SME must enter, and what output the bank would want. |
| **Week 2** | Build low-fidelity prototype (e.g. Figma + Airtable logic) that produces a sample loan packet PDF. Run by 2–3 SMEs and 1–2 bank advisors (ProCredit?) for feedback. |
| **Week 3** | Incorporate a public calculator (e.g. EEQuest) and create a usable beta version for 1–2 project types. Add vendor input fields and estimate ranges. |
| **Week 4** | Conduct pilot tests: 3–5 SMEs use it to produce loan proposals. Measure time saved and clarity gained. Begin outreach to banks for feedback/interest. |

---

## **6. Medium-Term Expansion**
- **Add a grant/incentive finder**: pull from national + EU databases.
- **Create a “project pipeline dashboard”** for banks: allows banks to see semi-qualified green projects from SMEs.
- **Offer this as a white-label tool** for banks like ProCredit to run on their own website.

---

## **7. Final Verdict**
> You’re not abandoning the green enablement idea. You’re **graduating it**—from vague inspiration to a **pointed product** with a real user and urgent demand.

**Your goal isn’t to be another ESG startup.**  
**Your goal is to be the green deal’s front door for SMEs.**
