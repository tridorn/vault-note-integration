**Your optimal move right now is to develop a targeted fintech prototype that solves a specific, strategically painful problem for ProCredit — one that can later scale into a regional infrastructure play.** You should not aim to build a full bank or a consumer fintech. You should **develop a razor-sharp, modular B2B tool** that ProCredit can’t build fast enough themselves.

After analyzing ProCredit’s strategy, weaknesses, and positioning, the **highest-leverage, lowest-risk idea** is the following:

---

## **Build: A Cross-Border Digital Onboarding & Identity Layer for Diaspora Banking**  
> _“A plug-and-play onboarding module that allows ProCredit (and later, other banks) to easily acquire and serve Eastern European diaspora and displaced clients across borders — even when they lack traditional documents or reside abroad.”_

---

### **The Problem You’re Solving (With Precision):**  
ProCredit — like many banks in Eastern Europe — **struggles to onboard and serve cross-border clients**, especially:
- **Diaspora customers** who live in Germany/Italy and want to keep accounts in Serbia, Kosovo, Georgia, etc.  
- **Displaced Ukrainians** who don’t have traditional proof of address or local credit history.  
- **SMEs run by migrants** who fall between jurisdictions.

ProCredit **wants to serve these people** (e.g., they built Kosovo–Germany services, German–Ukraine desks), but their **KYC, onboarding UX, and internal systems weren’t built for this complexity.**

---

### **Your Solution:**
You build a **front-end onboarding layer** (web/mobile) that:
- **Guides users step-by-step** through account setup, even across borders  
- Uses **KYC-light options** like digital IDs, embassy attestations, facial verification  
- **Auto-generates documentation bundles** tailored to ProCredit’s compliance teams  
- Allows users to **connect bank accounts in both home and host countries**  
- Optionally integrates **language/localization modules** to support expats  

Behind the scenes, it uses APIs (eventually) to push user data to ProCredit’s internal system or ProPay backend.  
**You don’t touch core banking — you handle the UX and data prep.**

---

### **Why This Is the Best Move Now**
- **Solves a problem ProCredit already admits it has** (onboarding diaspora/displaced clients is messy and manual).  
- **Unlocks new deposits and loan customers for them** with zero branch cost.  
- **Can be piloted quickly** (MVP can be clickable Figma, Webflow, or a mock API).  
- **Scales horizontally** — any regional bank wants this (OTP, Raiffeisen, Intesa).  
- **Can evolve into a larger infrastructure play** — identity/KYC, compliance automation, onboarding-as-a-service.

---

### **Your MVP Goal in 6 Weeks**
- Map out the **diaspora onboarding journey**  
- Create a **prototype for one corridor**: e.g., German–Ukrainian or Italian–Kosovar  
- Build:  
   - Web/mobile UI prototype  
   - Document guidance module  
   - Identity verification flow (mock or real)  
   - Submission dashboard for bank staff  

Then, show it to ProCredit. Say:
> _“We’ve identified a critical opportunity to help you acquire thousands of diaspora clients per corridor, without opening new branches. Here’s a simple onboarding layer that lets you do it, fully compliant, and fast. Let’s pilot this together.”_

If they say yes, you’re off.  
If they hesitate, **you still have a validated fintech wedge product** for regional banks.

---

## **What Happens After**
If this gets traction:
- You evolve it into a **modular B2B fintech infrastructure company** (Option B).  
- You raise a small round, sell to other banks in Albania, Moldova, Georgia, Serbia, etc.  
- You plug into **onboarding, compliance, and cross-border UX** — one of the stickiest areas in fintech.

Worst case: you build a pilot, get feedback, and use it to springboard your next move.

---

## **To Summarize:**
**Build:**  
A prototype onboarding layer for ProCredit to digitally acquire diaspora/displaced users.

**Solve:**  
A concrete, painful problem they already have, but can't solve without an external push.

**Win:**  
- Real-world traction  
- Expandable infrastructure product  
- High credibility as a first-time fintech founder  
- Freedom to later pivot, fundraise, or scale
