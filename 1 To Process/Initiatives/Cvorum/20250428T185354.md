### One-Sentence Essence  
*A cloud-native orchestration platform that ingests raw SME and project data, verifies its “greenworthiness,” attaches the cheapest public guarantees, and emits a regulator-grade loan dossier that banks can approve in days rather than months—then keeps streaming performance telemetry so nobody ever re-keys a PDF again.*

## What We Are **Building**—Decomposed

| Layer | Purpose | Core Functionality | Concrete Artifact Produced |
|-------|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| **1. Data-Ingestion Spine** | Capture immutable evidence | • Open-banking API for balance-sheet + cash-flow<br>• ERP connector for invoices and CapEx<br>• Smart-meter / sensor feed for kWh + CO₂ | **“Green Passport” JSON object**—digitally signed snapshot of SME finances & energy baseline |
| **2. Project Assembly & Vendor Exchange** | Convert intent into a bankable retrofit scope | • Wizard that arranges 3 compliant quotes from vetted installers<br>• Embedded ROI + payback model<br>• Auto-populate EU Taxonomy criteria | **Standardised Statement of Work** matched to NACE/CPV codes |
| **3. Eligibility & Guarantee Engine** | Slash risk and interest cost | • Rule-based match to KfW, Bürgschaftsbank, InvestEU guarantees<br>• Instant calculation of residual LGD<br>• Generation of annex forms | **Guarantee Certificate bundle** (PDF + XML) |
| **4. Risk-File Compiler (Bank API)** | Give credit committees everything in one package | • Maps all inputs to EBA ESG-risk file template<br>• Exports human-readable PDF & machine JSON<br>• Push button: upload to bank’s LOS or via REST | **Loan Dossier**—“ready-to-approve” |
| **5. MRV Loop (Post-Funding)** | Prove impact, police covenants | • Continuous sensor vs. forecast variance checks<br>• Escrow release or vendor remediation ticket<br>• Live data feed into bank’s monitoring system | **Telemetry Dashboard** + automated covenant alerts |

> **Analogy:** *TurboTax for sustainability evidence + Stripe for guarantee stacking + Bloomberg terminal for the lender’s ESG file.*

## Stakeholder Journey — From Click to Capital

1. **SME (12 min):**  
   - OAuth into bank account → uploads last energy bill → picks “Heat-pump retrofit”.  
   - Platform returns IRR, monthly savings, and **binding APR** already net of KfW subsidy.  
2. **Vendor (T + 24 h):**  
   - Accepts digital purchase order, commits to telemetry-enabled install; escrow is pre-funded.  
3. **Lender (T + 48 h):**  
   - Receives complete dossier (taxonomy proof, guarantee certificate, cash-flow model, vendor credentials).  
   - Runs automated credit model, signs term sheet—no back-and-forth.  
4. **Post-Closing:**  
   - Sensors stream kWh; if performance drifts -10 %, ticket auto-opens with vendor, protecting all parties.

## Non-Replicable USP

1. **Regulator-Grade Evidence Rail** – first mover to hard-code forthcoming SME Sustainable-Finance Standard and EBA file template.  
2. **One-Click Guarantee Stacking** – collapses capital charges; incumbent LOS systems cannot.  
3. **Longitudinal Telemetry Moat** – continuous MRV data set regulators and reinsurers crave; switching off the platform means re-auditing every byte.

## Build Sequence (Minimum to Viable)

| Sprint | Deliverable | Kill-Metric (must hit) |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **0-1** | OAuth + bank parser, energy-bill OCR | <2 min data ingestion |
| **2-3** | Taxonomy rules engine v1, single retrofit template | ≥90 % auto-classification accuracy |
| **4-5** | Guarantee API for KfW-295 + Bürgschaft | Effective APR ≤ 3.5 % |
| **6**   | ESG Risk-file PDF/JSON exporter | Credit-committee acceptance in ≤7 days |
| **7-8** | IoT telemetry pipe + alerting | 95 % sensor uptime |

### If You Remember Only Two Things

1. **Product = Evidence Factory.**  We do not sell loans; we manufacture the proof that makes green loans irresistibly cheap to underwrite.  
2. **Moat = Continuous Data Gravity.**  Once a bank books assets through us, our live telemetry becomes embedded in its models; ripping us out is scarier than paying the fee.

Everything else is implementation detail.
