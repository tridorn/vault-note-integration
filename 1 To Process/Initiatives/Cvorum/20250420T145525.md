**Refined Expression of Your Request**  
> *“List the core documents and structured inputs I will need to define, control, and operationalise each flow.”*

---

## Core Document Set — The Non-Negotiables  
This is the **foundational paperwork of trust**. Not marketing. Not pitch decks. These are the documents, data structures, and interface contracts that enable institutional-grade coordination. Each is a **control artifact**—a proof, a trigger, or a container of obligations.

I’ve grouped them into four tiers: **Legal**, **Technical**, **Data**, and **Operational**.

---

### I. **Legal & Trust Artifacts**  
These codify rights, obligations, and data permissions.

| Doc / Input | Format | Purpose | When Used |
|-------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Consent Agreement** | Clickwrap PDF / e-sign | Grants platform access to SME data (financials, energy, bank feeds). | Flow 1 |
| **Platform Terms of Use** | Legal PDF | Defines roles, liabilities, service expectations for SMEs, vendors. | Flow 0 |
| **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** | PDF | GDPR-compliant structure for 3rd-party verifications. | Flow 2 |
| **Escrow Agreement** | Legal contract | Controls release of funds to vendors post-verification. | Flow 5 |
| **Loan Agreement Template** | Dynamic PDF | Legal document with terms, repayment structure, covenants. | Flow 4 |
| **Inspection Certificate** | Structured PDF + photos | Certifies project completion. Used to release escrow / start amortisation. | Flow 6 |

**Pro tip:** Legal docs must be modular, with clause toggles for jurisdiction, size of loan, etc.

---

### II. **Technical & Workflow Spec Artifacts**  
These define how data flows and how decisions are rendered.

| Doc / Input | Format | Purpose | When Used |
|-------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Opportunity Object Schema** | JSON schema | Defines what a loanable event is (asset, vendor, SME, price, etc). | Flow 1 |
| **Credential Token Structure** | JWT or JSON | Issued to verified parties; contains scope of actions allowed. | Flow 0 |
| **Verification Payload Structure** | JSON or XML | Standardised request sent to verifier APIs (green impact, KYC). | Flow 2 |
| **Loan Decision Payload** | JSON | Response from bank with outcome, interest rate, conditions. | Flow 4 |
| **Smart Escrow Instruction Set** | JSON / API spec | Logic tree for when funds can be released. | Flow 5 |

---

### III. **Data Models & Structured Inputs**  
You must define every field that enters your system.

| Artifact | Format | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **SME Profile Template** | JSON / Form | `Entity name, turnover, energy spend, location, sector, bank data access token` |
| **Vendor Profile** | JSON / Form | `Legal entity, certified products, delivery geography, installation capacity` |
| **Green-Asset Quote** | JSON | `SKU, category, projected CO₂e savings, price, payback est.` |
| **Impact-Credit Matrix** | Structured table | Merges financial metrics (DSCR, LTV, tenor) with impact (CO₂e/€) |
| **Loan Repayment Schedule** | Table / JSON | `Start date, monthly amount, duration, grace period, payment dates` |

**Every input must be versioned.** No overwriting—append, tag, and link.

---

### IV. **Operational Tools & Evidence Artifacts**  
Used to track process fidelity, generate reports, and manage edge cases.

| Artifact | Format | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Audit Trail Log** | Append-only DB | Captures all state changes, approvals, data updates, timestamps. |
| **Inspection Photos & GPS Proof** | ZIP or structured folder | Verifiable evidence of installation. |
| **ESG Impact Report Template** | PDF or dashboard | Contains impact KPIs, methodology, verifier assurance level. |
| **Delinquency Workflow Protocol** | Flowchart or SOP | Defines escalation rules, triggers, and contact scripts. |

---

### Bonus: **Pitch-Adjacent Documents** (for stakeholder buy-in)

| Artifact | Format | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Flow Overview Deck** | PPT / PDF | Visual map of platform logic for non-technical partners (e.g., bank execs). |
| **Sample Loan Dossier** | PDF mock | Show banks the precision and depth of what they’ll receive. |
| **Pilot Term Sheet Template** | DOCX / PDF | Pre-approved draft for 1–2 pilot lenders. Reduces negotiation cycles. |

---

## Next Step Actions (Execution-Ready)

1. **Draft These First** (minimally):
   - `GreenAssetQuote_v0.json`  
   - `ConsentAgreement_v0.pdf`  
   - `OpportunitySchema_v0.json`  
   - `SampleESGReport_v0.pdf`  

2. **Then, simulate a flow** using dummy data. Run it end-to-end.

3. **Create a single Notion or Git repo** with versioned folders:
   - `/docs/legal/`
   - `/docs/data_models/`
   - `/docs/flows/`
   - `/docs/pilots/`

This becomes your **founder operating system**.

Would you like me to generate the first version of the Green Asset Quote or Opportunity JSON schema? Or a Consent Agreement template?
