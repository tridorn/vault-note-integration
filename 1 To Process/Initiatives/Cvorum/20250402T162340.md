First version:

Below is a **short, orchestrated pitch** you can deliver in a **1-on-1** context with the ProCredit representative. It includes **5–6 slides** (maximum) so you stay concise, along with **key talking points** for each. Since you want to showcase **professionalism and international ambition**, you’ll use **English** throughout – even if your audience is bilingual. The slides will be **minimal text,** focusing on clarity and visual impact.

---

## **Overall Pitch Flow (5–6 Minutes)**

1. **Slide 1 – Emotional Hook**  
2. **Slide 2 – The Problem** (why small businesses struggle)  
3. **Slide 3 – Our Solution** (what your platform does)  
4. **Slide 4 – Mutual Benefits** (why it’s great for ProCredit)  
5. **Slide 5 – Pilot Proposal** (next steps together)  
6. **Optional Slide 6 – Q&A** or Thank You

You’ll spend **about 1 minute per slide** (some less, some more), plus time for Q&A.

---

## **Slide 1: Emotional Hook**

### **Slide Title:**  
**“Empowering Everyday Green Heroes”**

### **Visual:**  
- A **photo** of a friendly small business owner in front of their shop/farm/bakery – something that conveys local warmth and authenticity.  
- Possibly show a subtle green element (solar panels, or fresh produce).  

### **What You **Say** (Talking Points):**  
- “Imagine Mariya, who runs a local bakery in our region. She’s determined to cut down her energy costs and carbon footprint by installing an efficient oven and better insulation, but she has **no clue where to start**.  
- She spends days reading conflicting info, applying for small grants, getting stuck in endless forms, only to have banks say, *‘We’re not sure your project meets our green criteria.’*  
- **At GreenBridge**, we believe that people like Mariya—our everyday neighbors—should be able to go green **easily** and **sustainably**.”

**Time:** ~30–45 seconds

---

## **Slide 2: The Problem**

### **Slide Title:**  
**“SMEs Are Locked Out of Green Financing”**

### **Visual:**  
- A **simple infographic** or bullet chart showing key frustrations for SMEs. Minimal text.  

### **Possible Bullet Points (On Screen):**  
1. Complex eligibility & application processes  
2. Fragmented funding sources (banks, grants, etc.)  
3. No easy access to vetted vendors  
4. High transaction costs for smaller loans

*(Keep it very brief – no paragraphs!)*

### **What You **Say** (Talking Points):**  
- “Millions of small businesses across Eastern Europe and beyond want to invest in clean technology—like solar panels, energy-efficient machinery—but they quickly find the **process confusing and costly**.  
- Banks often can’t justify the **due diligence** for small loans; SMEs don’t have the time or money for **expensive consultants** to prove their project is green.  
- **As a result**, billions in potential clean investments stay on the sidelines, hurting both communities and banks that want more green lending.”

**Time:** ~1 minute

---

## **Slide 3: Our Solution**

### **Slide Title:**  
**“GreenBridge: A One-Stop Gateway to Green Finance”**

### **Visual:**  
- A **flow diagram** showing 3 main steps (Project Scoping → Funding Match → Impact Verification), each leading to a final “Loan Approved” or “Project Installed.”  

### **Minimal Slide Text:**  
- **Project Scoping**: Automated ROI & carbon reduction calculator  
- **Funding Marketplace**: Access to bank loans, grants, vendor financing  
- **Compliance & Monitoring**: Auto-generated green compliance docs, real-time tracking  

### **What You **Say** (Talking Points):**  
- “GreenBridge is a **digital aggregator**. SMEs log in, describe their project—or simply pick from a library of typical green upgrades—and instantly see estimated **savings** and **CO₂ reductions**.  
- Next, they’re matched with **relevant financing options**—like ProCredit’s green credit lines, or local subsidies.  
- We also help with **post-loan monitoring**, so banks see real results without extensive manual checks.  
- **In essence**, we cut the cost, time, and confusion for both SMEs and lenders so **everyone** can push forward on climate action.”

**Time:** ~1 minute

## **Slide 4: Why ProCredit Benefits**

### **Slide Title:**  
**“Accelerate Your Green Portfolio with Less Risk”**

### **Visual:**  
- A **simple** or stylized chart highlighting possible benefits: short underwriting times, new SME sign-ups, etc.  

### **Possible Bullet Points (On Screen):**  
- **Faster Underwriting**: Up to 70% reduction in time for smaller loans  
- **More Qualified Leads**: SMEs come pre-verified with green ROI data  
- **Meets ESG Targets**: Clear compliance with EU Taxonomy  
- **Boosts Brand & Impact**: Positions ProCredit as the #1 green lender for local SMEs

### **What You **Say** (Talking Points):**  
- “ProCredit is already known for **responsible banking** and **SME focus**. Our platform essentially **funnels** small businesses directly to you, with all the data you need to assess their green claims.  
- This means **less friction** for your loan officers, **lower risk** (since the projects are pre-screened), and **more deals closed**.  
- Beyond that, you **enhance your brand** as the leading partner for climate-smart SMEs—cementing your position in the region as a champion of sustainability.”

**Time:** ~1 minute

---

## **Slide 5: Pilot Proposal**

### **Slide Title:**  
**“Let’s Pilot Together”**

### **Visual:**  
- A **simple timeline or bullet list** showing steps in a pilot:  
  1. Define one target market (e.g., solar or HVAC upgrades, region X)  
  2. Integrate ProCredit’s green criteria in our platform  
  3. Launch to 50–100 SMEs as a test  
  4. Measure results, refine & scale  

### **What You **Say** (Talking Points):**  
- “We propose starting **small**: pick a specific type of project—like rooftop solar or efficient bakery ovens—and target 50 SMEs in your network.  
- We integrate your **green lending criteria** so that any applicant meets your documentation needs right away.  
- We measure how many successful loans we process, how satisfied the SMEs are, and how much time your team saves.  
- If it’s successful, we **expand** the pilot and incorporate more project categories. This approach is **low-risk, high-reward** for both of us.”

**Time:** ~1 minute

---

## **(Optional) Slide 6: Q&A or “Thank You”**

### **Slide Title:**  
**“Ready to Empower Local Businesses Together?”**

### **Visual:**  
- A **thank you** or Q&A invitation. Possibly show your **contact info** or a big “Thank You.”  

### **What You **Say** (Talking Points):**  
- “We’d love your **feedback** and to discuss if a pilot aligns with your strategic goals. Thank you for the chance to share this vision—let’s see how we can make green financing accessible to all.”

**Time:** ~30 seconds.  

---

## **Language & Style**

- **Use English** throughout. It shows you’re **thinking globally** and polishes your presentation for an international standard.  
- Keep your **tone** warm, confident, and **collaborative**. You want them to feel **invited** into the mission, not pitched to.  
- Even in 1-on-1, a **small deck** can help them visually follow. If they prefer a discussion, show slides as reference, but stay conversational.

---

## **Final Tips for the 1-on-1 Setting**

1. **Establish a Warm Rapport**: Start by asking about **ProCredit’s** current green initiatives—show genuine interest.  
2. **Pause for Input**: After each slide, invite them to **comment or question** so it feels like a dialogue.  
3. **Offer Realistic Next Steps**: Possibly hand them a **simple 1-page pilot outline** they can take back to their colleagues.  
4. **Time Management**: If they have 10–15 minutes, keep your slides very concise—**no bullet overload**—and let them talk.

---

**Good luck** with your pitch! Balancing **professional visuals** and **human-centered storytelling** will demonstrate both your **international ambition** and your **local, social** focus. By ending with a **clear pilot proposal**, you’ll have a strong chance of securing further discussions and buy-in.

Second version:

**Absolutely. Here’s a precise, orchestrated 5-slide pitch setup** for your practice presentation today—with **what to show on each slide**, and **what to say out loud** in each segment. This version is tailored for a **1-on-1 or small group context**, where you want to come across as **professional, international, and vision-driven**, yet emotionally resonant. You’ll speak in English, calmly, clearly, with an understated passion.

## **Slide 1 – "The Forgotten Climate Actor"**  
### **Visual:**  
- Full-screen photo of a real-looking small business (a bakery, auto repair shop, or vineyard—not a cliché solar panel)  
- A quote: _“We’d love to go green, but we don’t even know where to begin.”_ — Mariya, bakery owner, Romania

### **What to Say:**  
> “Across Eastern Europe, millions of family-run businesses want to do the right thing—switch to green technologies, reduce energy costs, and take climate action. But they’re not multinationals.  
>   
> Mariya, who runs a bakery near Cluj, wants to install a more efficient oven that cuts her gas use by 40%. She asks her bank. The response? _‘That’s too small. Too complicated.’_  
>   
> This is the reality for tens of thousands of SMEs today. They want to help. But they’re stuck in a system not designed for them.”

---

## **Slide 2 – “A System That Leaves SMEs Behind”**  
### **Visual:**  
- 3 boxes/columns:  
   - **Confusing Application Process** (icons: form, exclamation mark)  
   - **Fragmented Funding Landscape** (EU, bank, government logos floating disconnected)  
   - **No Trusted Vendor Access** (icon: question mark over solar installer)

### **What to Say:**  
> “What Mariya runs into isn’t bad intention—it’s bad infrastructure.  
> - She doesn’t know what counts as a ‘green’ project.  
> - EU programs, bank loans, and government subsidies each have different paperwork.  
> - She has no idea who to trust for installation.  
>   
> Meanwhile, banks like ProCredit want to lend green—this is your strategic mission. But smaller loans are too costly to process. Everyone loses.”

**Pause briefly. Let the reality sink in.**

---

## **Slide 3 – “GreenBridge: Building the Rails for Green Lending”**  
### **Visual:**  
A clean visual with 4 icons in a horizontal flow:  
1. **SME enters project idea**  
2. **Platform auto-estimates ROI & carbon savings**  
3. **Generates lender-ready project packet**  
4. **Connects to financing + vendor**

Below: tagline: _“From idea to impact, in one system.”_

### **What to Say:**  
> “GreenBridge is a digital platform that helps SMEs scope, qualify, and apply for green upgrades—without needing consultants, or endless forms.  
>   
> It standardizes green project data, so banks get loan requests with clean, verifiable metrics—carbon savings, ROI, repayment confidence—all in a consistent format.  
>   
> And we’re building this as infrastructure: one shared rail that connects SMEs, banks, vendors, and public programs.”

---

## **Slide 4 – “Why It Matters to ProCredit”**  
### **Visual:**  
Two columns:  
**Today** vs **With GreenBridge**  
- SME leads: scattered vs. qualified pipeline  
- Loan review: manual vs. 70% time saved  
- Compliance: complex vs. automated dossier  
- Impact: underleveraged vs. visible portfolio growth

### **What to Say:**  
> “ProCredit has led the way in green SME finance—especially in the Balkans. But the cost of acquisition and verification for smaller projects slows that growth.  
>   
> With GreenBridge, you could:  
> - Acquire more SME clients with cleaner data  
> - Increase your green loan volume without increasing your headcount  
> - Hit ESG targets faster with less friction  
> - And strengthen your position as the most accessible green bank in the region.”

---

## **Slide 5 – “Let’s Build This Together”**  
### **Visual:**  
A clean visual with 3 bullet points + your logo:  
- **Pilot idea**: Co-develop a prototype around one loan product or region  
- **Low-lift**: We handle UX, scoping, documentation logic  
- **High upside**: Build trust, impact, and pipeline—fast

### **What to Say:**  
> “We’re not here to sell a tool. We’re here to build something with you that unlocks capital, enables your mission, and empowers local businesses.  
>   
> Our ask is simple: let’s explore a pilot—maybe in one region, with one loan product. We’ll bring the prototype. You bring the insight.  
>   
> Could we schedule a short follow-up to see where this fits your roadmap?”

**Then pause and listen. Be quiet. Let them respond.**

---

## **Language Note**
Because you’re pitching in a professional, semi-international context, and because the **ProCredit representative will almost certainly be comfortable with English**, **you should absolutely pitch in English**. It sends a strong, subtle signal that:
- You’re building for **international scalability**, not provincial operations  
- You’re **serious about partnership and professionalism**  
- You see yourself as **pan-European from day one**

If anyone is confused or unsure, offer to clarify individual terms or explain in German afterward—but stay English as your **default operating language**.

---

## **Final Notes**
- Speak slowly, clearly, calmly—**don’t oversell, be confident in the quality of the idea**  
- Smile once; then focus  
- Close with a warm but professional line:  
  > _“Thanks for listening. We’d really appreciate your perspective—and we’d love to explore whether this might serve ProCredit’s mission even more directly.”_

If you want, I can format these slides into an actual deck for you—just say the word.
