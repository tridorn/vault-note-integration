**Pre-Mortem Counsel**

1. **Strategic Thesis – orchestration, not intermediation**  
   Your platform only creates durable advantage if it becomes the *system-of-record* for (a) SME sustainability data and (b) vendor performance credentials.  Merely listing loans is replicable; owning the *data exhaust* that banks must cite for EBA-mandated ESG risk files is not.  Draft governance so every document, sensor feed, and invoice is digitally signed and time-stamped; make the bank’s regulatory audit trail a one-click export.  Under the EBA’s January 2025 Guidelines, institutions must “identify, measure and monitor ESG risk” across the loan life-cycle – whoever supplies that evidence wins the choke-point.  ([The EBA publishes its final Guidelines on the management of ESG ...](https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-its-final-guidelines-management-esg-risks?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

2. **Regulatory Flux – weaponise uncertainty**  
   Brussels is simultaneously tightening green-finance definitions (EU Taxonomy, SME Sustainable-Finance Standard) while *loosening* CSRD reporting for smaller firms to cut red tape.  This volatility is a gift: SMEs cannot track shifting rules; banks dread mis-labelled assets.  Offer “compliance as a continuously updated service” and price it as insurance against reputational fines.  ([[PDF] Streamlining sustainable finance for SMEs](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/document/download/0d8e5199-44c2-4a17-affc-0f398443e603_en?filename=250321-sustainable-finance-platform-report-smes_en.pdf&utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Corporate sustainability reporting - Finance - European Commission](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

3. **Wedge Strategy – start where risk premia are absurdly high**  
   Target energy-intensive micro-manufacturers and multi-tenant logistics facilities: they face punitive utility costs and must decarbonise quickly, so payback on heat-pumps, rooftop PV, and insulation is obvious.  Vendors love the volume concentration, banks enjoy tangible collateral, and your underwriting algorithms learn on homogenous asset classes before generalising.  Land three anchor projects, publish “cycle-time crushed from 90→14 days”, and weaponise that metric in every pitch deck.  

4. **Data & Verification Stack**  
   * Source-of-truth: Open-banking feeds for financials, smart-meter telemetry for kilowatt-hours saved, geotagged photos for asset-in-place proof.  
   * Taxonomy mapping: auto-classify CapEx under EU NACE/CPV codes; flag ambiguous spends for manual override.  
   * MRV loop: continuous ingestion → variance detection → vendor remediation ticket.  
   Automate 80 % of human underwriting; leave only covenant negotiation to people.  Each percentage point of default avoided compounds into expanding risk limits with partner banks.  

5. **Monetisation Architecture**  
   | Revenue Line | Rationale | Counter-party | Strategic Risk | Mitigation |  
   |--------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
   | 1–2 % origination fee | Already budgeted in bank CAC | Lender | Disintermediation once KYC/ESG rails copied | Embed proprietary MRV data; banks can’t replicate cheaply |  
   | 0.5–1 % vendor rebate | Lead-gen cost below their salesforce | Vendor | Platform viewed as “tax” | Offer instant pay-out on milestone proof to flip into net working-capital benefit |  
   | Subscription (tiered) | “Ever-green compliance updates” | SME | Price elasticity | Tie fee to EU regulatory update cadence; escalate when new guidelines hit |  

6. **Liability Shield**  
   When a loan later fails ESG scrutiny, regulators claw back bank capital relief.  Draft T&Cs that platform *certifies data provenance* but not borrower intent; banks buy a *right to rely* backed by audited process, not an indemnity on outcomes.  Consider a captive insurer once deal flow ≥ €500 m to monetise residual risk.  

7. **Capital Leverage**  
   Bolt on guarantee schemes (EIB InnovFin, KfW Umwelt, upcoming €100 bn EU Industrial Decarbonisation Bank) to slice LGD; your API should auto-check eligibility and pre-populate forms.  This alone can drop pricing by 150–250 bps – a narrative that sells itself to CFOs.  ([EU struggles to balance its green and growth goals](https://www.ft.com/content/6f74926a-6ab3-46ee-a434-573c588b7ff4?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

8. **Execution Next-Steps (90-day clock)**  
   * Week 0–4 Sign one Tier-2 German Landesbank willing to sandbox ESG-lite loans under €1 m.  
   * Week 5–8 Onboard five vetted retrofit vendors; enforce API/SDK data push as a condition of listing.  
   * Week 9–12 Close ten pilot loans, publish actuarial dossier; use empirical loss-given-default simulations to negotiate a first-loss guarantee tranche with EIF.  

**Bottom line:** You are constructing an information cartel.  Dominate ESG data integrity, let capital chase you, and the network externalities will calcify around your rails before incumbents finish their budget cycle.
