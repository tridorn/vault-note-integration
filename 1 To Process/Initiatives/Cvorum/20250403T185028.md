A **visual demonstration** is incredibly powerful, especially for non-technical or cautious stakeholders. The easier you make it for ProCredit to see and **feel** the user experience, the more they’ll grasp the value proposition. A **clickable prototype** is the perfect solution—**lightweight** to build yet **compelling** to present.

Below is a recommended approach:

---

## **1. Choose a Rapid Prototyping Tool**
- **Figma**: Quick to learn, easy to share via a browser link, and supports clickable flows.  
- **InVision**: Also popular, especially for rapid interactive mockups.  
- **Marvel** or **Proto.io**: Similar solutions with built-in user-flow linking.  

### **My Suggestion**  
- If you have **any** design familiarity, **Figma** is a top pick: it’s free (for small teams), easy to collaborate on, and widely used.

---

## **2. Sketch the Core Screens You Need**

You don’t need to mock the entire platform. Focus on a short user journey that **demonstrates how it solves ProCredit’s immediate pain**. For the rooftop solar pilot, you might show:

1. **SME Onboarding Screen**  
   - Simple form with business name, location, monthly energy spend.  
   - Possibly a quick “ROI Calculator” input.

2. **Project Overview & Calculation**  
   - A “results” page showing **estimated solar panel size**, approximate cost, payback period, CO₂ saved.  
   - Include a “Request Vendor Quote” button.

3. **Vendor Quote Screen**  
   - List or card layout with 2–3 fictional solar installers.  
   - Each card has cost, estimated wattage, and “select” button.

4. **Loan Application Packet Preview**  
   - A simplified PDF preview or embedded summary that compiles all project data (SME details, cost, ROI, vendor info).  
   - A button: “**Submit to ProCredit**.”

5. **ProCredit Dashboard** (Optional)  
   - A minimal bank staff view: new application, standardized data, a quick click to “approve/decline/ask questions.”  

---

## **3. Keep the Flow Simple (4–5 Clicks Maximum)**

**One** short journey from:
- “I want a solar solution”  
- → “Here’s my data & quote”  
- → “Submit to ProCredit”  
- → “Bank sees it”

This ensures **any viewer** can follow the end-to-end story in under 2 minutes, and it highlights your platform’s **differentiator**: generating a complete, consistent green loan application from minimal user input.

---

## **4. Add Realistic Visual Cues**

- **Use a ProCredit logo** or color scheme on the bank-facing screens—makes it look tailored.  
- For the SME screens, incorporate a fictional SME’s data (e.g., “Bosko’s Bakery”) with **sample monthly energy usage**.  
- For the vendor quotes, show a **fake brand name** (“SolarInstall24”) plus quick, realistic quote info (“€25k, payback in 5 years”).  
- Keep the **layout clean**, with bank-friendly design: white backgrounds, straightforward fonts, minimal color aside from brand highlights.

---

## **5. Show Key Value Statements on Each Screen**

To reinforce the **value** for ProCredit, pepper in short text blurbs:

- **SME screens**: “Get an instant ROI estimate—no complicated audits needed!”  
- **Vendor quote screen**: “All installers here are ProCredit-approved, ensuring quality.”  
- **Loan application packet preview**: “Standardized green compliance data for quick underwriting.”  
- **ProCredit dashboard**: “All essential details in one place—approve with confidence.”

This keeps your **pitch** integrated into the visual experience.

---

## **6. Polish the Presentation**

- **Narrate** while you click through: “Now the SME sees a quick ROI calculation… see how easy it is to get an installer quote… then they finalize a standard application for the bank.”  
- **Use short tooltips** or “hover states” if your prototyping tool allows it, further illustrating how each button works (e.g., “Click here to compare quotes”).  

---

## **7. Optional Enhancements**

1. **Scrolling PDF Mockup**: On the application packet screen, embed a **“scrollable PDF preview”** containing real placeholders for costs, ROI, etc. It adds realism to the final application.  
2. **Bank Staff Action**: On the bank view, show how a credit officer might “approve” or “ask question,” prompting a chat or small form.  
3. **Gamified ROI**: If you want some flair, show a small **‘Energy Savings Over Time’** chart with hypothetical cost curves.  

---

## **Final Tips**

1. **Minimal Setup**: Don’t overthink. A clickable prototype is **not** an enterprise system. It’s a **visual story**.  
2. **Use Realistic Language**: “Applicant Name,” “Monthly Electricity Bill,” “Estimated Wattage.” Avoid developer jargon.  
3. **Timebox the Effort**: You can build a neat 4–5 screen Figma prototype in **1–2 days** if you keep it simple.  
4. **“We Built This for You”**: Brand it with ProCredit’s name/logo so they feel it’s **their** pilot environment.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
Yes, a **clickable prototype** is the best way to help ProCredit **visualize** the workflow and get excited about your solution. Keep it short, realistic, and focus on **demonstrating how you reduce friction** for both the SME and ProCredit’s underwriting process. This is the simplest route to **“aha!”**.

Below is a **step-by-step UI blueprint** you can copy into a new chat or reference as you build a **clickable prototype** (e.g., in Figma). It walks you through exactly **which screens to create, how they look, and how they connect**. You don’t need advanced design skills—just a clear structure and a few intuitive layouts. 

Feel free to use this as a **script** when you start a new chat or as a roadmap if building on your own in Figma.

## **1. Create 5 Main Screens (Frames) in Figma**

We’ll keep the flow short and sweet: 
1. **Welcome/Landing**  
2. **SME Data Collection**  
3. **ROI Calculation / Summary**  
4. **Vendor Quote Selection**  
5. **Bank Application Packet**

Each screen demonstrates **one main step** in the user journey.

---

### **SCREEN 1: Welcome / Landing**

**Purpose:** Immediately convey that this is the place for SMEs to finance solar projects, with a clear call-to-action.

1. **Header Area**  
   - **Logo** (e.g., “GreenBridge” on the top-left, or use “Your Fintech” if you haven’t finalized a name).  
   - Possibly **ProCredit’s logo** on the top-right if you want to co-brand.

2. **Hero Text**  
   - **Headline**: “Easily Finance Your Solar Upgrade with ProCredit”

4. **Visual**  
   - A hero image or illustration of **rooftop solar panels** on an SME or a simple stylized city.

**Layout Tips:**  
- Keep it **centered**: large text in the middle, a single big CTA button. White background or subtle gradient.  
- Minimal clutter; you want them to click “Get Started.”

---

### **SCREEN 2: SME Data Collection**

**Purpose:** Capture basic data about the user’s business and energy usage.

1. **Header**  
   - Small top bar: “GreenBridge” and a **progress indicator** (“Step 1 of 4: Your Details”).

2. **Section A: Business Basics**  
   - **Fields**: “Business Name,” “Contact Person,” “Location / Address.”  
   - Possibly a dropdown or text field for “Business Type” (Restaurant, Retail, Office, etc.).

3. **Section B: Energy Info**  
   - **Monthly Electricity Bill** (e.g., “€500 / month”),  
   - “Approximate Roof Size” (Square meters) or “Do you own your rooftop?”  
   - Any other key data (like “Number of employees,” if relevant).

4. **Continue Button**  
   - “Next: See My ROI” → Goes to **Screen 3**.

**Layout Tips:**  
- Put fields in a **vertical form** with clear labels.  
- Use **one** column to keep it simple.  
- Show a **little help text** if needed (e.g., “Enter your average monthly electricity cost.”).

---

### **SCREEN 3: ROI Calculation & Summary**

**Purpose:** Show the user an **instant estimate** of how going solar affects their costs and carbon footprint.

1. **Header**  
   - “Step 2 of 4: Solar Savings Estimate”

2. **“Calculated Results” Box**  
   - Large text for **“Estimated System Size”** (e.g., “5 kW”).  
   - **Monthly Savings**: “You could save about €150/month.”  
   - **Payback Period**: “~ 4.5 years.”  
   - **CO₂ Reduction**: “2.3 metric tons / year.”  

   (You can fake the logic for the prototype—just show realistic placeholders.)

3. **Data Visualization (Optional)**  
   - A **small bar chart** or gauge to represent monthly savings.  
   - Or a simple text statement is enough if you’re not comfortable designing charts.

4. **Clarification Text**  
   - “These are estimates. We’ll confirm details with an official vendor quote.”  

5. **Button**: “Continue to Vendors” → goes to **Screen 4**.

**Layout Tips:**  
- Big, friendly numbers.  
- A short bullet list: *“Here’s your payback period, your monthly savings, your carbon reduction.”*

---

### **SCREEN 4: Vendor Quote Selection**

**Purpose:** Let the SME pick from curated solar installers or request a quote.

1. **Header**  
   - “Step 3 of 4: Choose Your Installer”

2. **Vendor Cards** (2–3 examples)  
   - Each card has:  
     - **Vendor Name** (e.g., “EcoSun Solutions”)  
     - A short “4.8 stars” rating or “Certified by ProCredit”  
     - A **Quote Price** (e.g., “€8,000 total cost”)  
     - Rough system size / expected output (“4.5 kW system, covers ~70% of your needs”).  

3. **Action**  
   - Each card has a “Select This Vendor” button, or “Request Quote” button.  
   - Possibly a “Compare Vendors” link if you want to be fancy.

4. **Continue Button**  
   - “Finalize My Application” → goes to **Screen 5**.

**Layout Tips:**  
- Use a **grid** or horizontal “cards,” each with consistent info.  
- Keep it minimal—**no** giant paragraphs, just key data.

---

### **SCREEN 5: Bank Application Packet**

**Purpose:** Summarize the entire project. Provide a “Submit to ProCredit” action.

1. **Header**  
   - “Step 4 of 4: Finalize Application”

2. **Application Summary**  
   - “Business Name: X”  
   - “Estimated Savings: Y”  
   - “Vendor Selected: EcoSun Solutions”  
   - “Project Cost: €8,000”  
   - “Loan Amount: €8,000 (assuming no down payment, or specify partial).”  

3. **Preview or PDF**  
   - You can visually show a small **PDF icon** or a “Preview Packet” link.  
   - Indicate this includes the ROI data, vendor info, and the SME’s details—**all in one standard format** for ProCredit.

4. **Submit Button**  
   - Big CTA: “Submit to ProCredit Bank.”  
   - On click, show a **Success Screen** or overlay: “Thank you! Your application has been sent. ProCredit will contact you soon.”

**Layout Tips:**  
- A **panel** with bold headings for each data section.  
- Possibly a **visual step** that says “Funding Request: €8,000” with a confirm checkmark.

---

## **Extra (Optional) Screen: ProCredit Dashboard**

If you want to illustrate how ProCredit sees these applications, add a **simplified bank staff view**:

- A **table** of incoming applications:  
  - “Applicant: Bosko’s Bakery”  
  - “Loan Request: €8,000”  
  - “Status: Under Review / Approved / Declined”  
- On click, they see a summary page with the same ROI data.  

This helps ProCredit visualize **how** your platform cuts their workload. If you’re short on time, you can skip this or show just a single “mock admin screen.”

---

## **2. How to Connect the Screens (Clickable Prototype)**

In Figma (or InVision/Marvel):
1. **Create 5 Frames** (one for each screen).  
2. **Draw Buttons** on each frame (“Get Started,” “Next,” etc.).  
3. **Use Prototype Mode** to link each button to the **next frame**.  
4. For the final submission, you can link a “Submit” button to a **Thank You** overlay or a final success message.

**Result:** A reviewer can click “Get Started” on Screen 1, fill in data on Screen 2, see an ROI on Screen 3, pick a vendor on Screen 4, and finalize on Screen 5. That’s enough to convey the core flow.

---

## **3. Design/Styling Tips**

- **Color Palette**: Keep it minimal—**white background**, a highlight color (maybe green for “eco-friendly”), black/grey text.  
- **Font**: Use a clean, modern font (e.g., **Montserrat, Lato**, or Figma’s default “Inter”).  
- **Buttons**: Make them big, with consistent styling (rounded corners, a bright color fill).  
- **Consistency**: Each screen should have the same **header style** and spacing, so it feels like one product.

---

## **4. Explanation & Storytelling**

As you walk ProCredit through your clickable prototype:
1. Start at **Screen 1**: “Here’s the main landing area where SMEs learn about the offer.”  
2. Move to **Screen 2**: “They input basic data—this is simpler than any standard bank form.”  
3. Go to **Screen 3**: “We instantly show an estimated payback—no waiting for an energy audit.”  
4. On to **Screen 4**: “They see real vendor quotes, so they pick a solution quickly.”  
5. Finally **Screen 5**: “All data merges into a standard package, which they can send to ProCredit with one click.”  

**In under 2 minutes**, you’ve illustrated the entire experience, from “I’m interested in solar” → “I submitted a robust application to ProCredit.”

---

## **5. How to Share With ProCredit**

- If using **Figma**, go to **Share** → “Anyone with the link can view Prototype.”  
- Send them the link, or better yet, **walk them through** in a Zoom/Teams call while you screen-share.  
- Let them click around themselves if time allows—**interactivity** really sells it.

---

### **Conclusion**

A clickable prototype is the fastest way to **visually communicate** your concept. By focusing on **5 short screens** that mirror the user flow, you’ll demonstrate exactly **how** you reduce friction and save time for both SMEs and ProCredit staff. Once they see it in action, they’ll **instantly** grasp your value proposition. 

**Now you can just go into a new conversation** (or your Figma file) and follow these instructions. Good luck with the design!

Below is a **concise, standalone overview** that **sets the stage** for your GreenBridge project—perfect for starting a brand-new conversation or onboarding new collaborators. It outlines the **problem** you’re addressing, **what your product does**, and **why** it matters.

---

# **GreenBridge: An Overview**

### **Context & Problem**
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across Eastern Europe (and beyond) are **eager to make green investments**—like installing rooftop solar, upgrading HVAC systems, or boosting energy efficiency. However, they face **serious hurdles**:

1. **Complexity**: Traditional banks require extensive audits and compliance checks; SMEs rarely have the in-house expertise or data to prove “greenness.”  
2. **Fragmented Funding**: There’s a confusing mix of banks, government grants, EU programs, and local incentives—all with different rules.  
3. **High Costs**: For smaller projects (under €100k), banks can find it **unprofitable** to underwrite detailed energy audits, leaving many SMEs **unserved**.  
4. **No Unified Platform**: Tools do exist (like EBRD’s Green Technology Selector or basic ESG scoring services), but **none** provide a **one-stop** solution for scoping, vendor matching, financing, and real-time impact reporting.

As a result, **billions of euros** in potential climate-friendly investments go unrealized, undermining both **SME competitiveness** and broader **carbon reduction goals**.

---

### **Our Solution: GreenBridge Infrastructure**
We’re building **GreenBridge**, a **fintech platform** that acts as **the “rails” or “infrastructure”** for green SME financing. In practical terms:

- **Project Wizard**: SMEs enter basic business data and get **instant ROI + carbon savings estimates** for common green upgrades.  
- **Vendor Directory**: Curated, trusted installers and suppliers. SMEs get **tailored quotes** in one place.  
- **Financing Marketplace**: Links to banks (like ProCredit), EU grants, and private investors—**pre-packaged** with standardized compliance data.  
- **Compliance & Reporting**: Automated “green compliance dossier” ensuring banks can **quickly** vet projects.  
- **Post-Finance Monitoring**: Gather real performance data (e.g., from utility bills or IoT) to **verify actual impact** and reduce risk.

**Goal**: Dramatically **speed up and scale** green lending for smaller projects, removing friction for both the **SME** (who wants to install solar or upgrade equipment) and the **bank** (which needs robust data to underwrite confidently).

---

### **Why This Matters**
1. **Green Loan Expansion**: Banks fulfill ESG mandates and grow a **profitable** new portfolio.  
2. **SME Empowerment**: Business owners save on energy costs and reduce carbon footprints.  
3. **Climate Impact**: Aggregating thousands of small projects yields a **significant decarbonization effect**.  
4. **Infrastructure Vision**: We become the standard pipeline for **all** green financing in emerging Europe—and eventually, worldwide.

---

### **Current Focus: A Pilot with ProCredit**
Our pilot will revolve around **rooftop solar** financing for SMEs in one region. We’ll use a **clickable prototype** to demonstrate the end-to-end user flow:

1. **SME enters data →** sees instant ROI calculation  
2. **Selects vendor →** application packet auto-generated  
3. **Submits to ProCredit →** faster approval, less manual overhead

With a successful pilot, we’ll **iterate** and expand to other green project types, additional banks, and more countries. Over time, we aim to become **the universal infrastructure** uniting SMEs, banks, donors, and vendors under **one streamlined green finance ecosystem**.

---

### **Next Steps**
- **Validate** the clickable prototype internally.  
- **Present** it to ProCredit to secure buy-in.  
- **Launch** a 3–4 month pilot focusing on rooftop solar.  
- **Track success metrics** (loan volume, time saved, CO₂ offsets).  
- **Refine** for broader rollout and potential multi-bank adoption.

If you’re jumping into a new chat with no prior context, this overview should serve as a **quick primer** on **what** we’re building and **why** it’s essential.
