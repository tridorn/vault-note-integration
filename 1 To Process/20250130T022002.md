# References in Note-Taking System

## Exposition

Whenever you mention data, facts, or ideas that aren't yours, they should be cited.

- **Inline Citations**: After the information or quote, place a superscript number or a bracketed number corresponding to a reference at the bottom of the note or the "References" section.
	 - AI is transforming industries.[^1]
	 - AI is transforming industries[1].

- **Reference Section**: At the end of the note, list out your references. This can be done in various citation styles (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.), but choose one and be consistent.

	 ```
    #### References
    [^1]: Smith, J. (2022). AI and the Future. Tech Publishers.
    ```

## General Workflow

1. **Always Cite**: Whenever you take information from somewhere, always make it a habit to jot down the source. This saves time when revisiting and ensures your content is trustworthy.

2. **Consistency**: Choose a referencing style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) and stick to it.

3. **Separate Original from Borrowed**: Ensure that quotes and references are clearly demarcated from your original thoughts.

4. **Use Templates**: To ensure consistency and save time, create templates in Obsidian for different types of notes that already have sections for quotes, references, and your personal notes.
