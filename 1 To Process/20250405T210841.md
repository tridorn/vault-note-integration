Below is a **concise overview** of the **most relevant insights** from the EBA’s “Report in Response to the Call for Advice from the European Commission on Green Loans and Mortgages” (December 2023) that could inform or support your own green-finance solution (Veridian). These points come directly from the document’s findings and recommendations, as shown in the attached file:

---

## 1. Green Lending Definitions & Market Overview
- The EBA highlights that there is **no uniform definition** of “green loans” in use. Most banks rely on **internal definitions** or partial references to industry frameworks (Loan Market Association’s Green Loan Principles, EU Taxonomy technical screening criteria, etc.).  
- According to the EBA’s industry survey, **green loans account for ~4.5%** of total loans on average (weighted by total assets). For **households**, this figure is higher (about 11%)—driven largely by “green mortgages.” For **SME** and corporate loans, the share is just ~2%.  
- The report notes that these percentages are based on banks’ self-identified “green loans,” so the actual share is approximate. Many banks do not systematically label green loans or are still refining their internal definitions.

**Why It’s Useful for You**:  
You can cite the **low current market share** to demonstrate **untapped potential**—especially among SMEs. Highlight that the market’s fragmentation (lack of uniform definitions) underscores the **need for a streamlined aggregator** like Veridian.

---

## 2. Voluntary EU Definition for Green Loans
- A key EBA recommendation is to create a **voluntary, EU-wide definition** for green loans, consistent with the EU sustainable finance framework (including the Taxonomy) but flexible enough to accommodate bank or national nuances.  
- The EBA envisions a **“green loan label”**: if a loan meets certain requirements (use of proceeds aligned with EU environmental objectives, robust eligibility checks, etc.), it could carry this label for clarity and credibility.

**Why It’s Useful for You**:  
Your platform could **integrate** these recommended criteria from the start, offering banks a **ready-made compliance path** for labeling green loans. This can streamline new product launches (e.g., “Veridian-labeled” or “EU-labeled” green loans).

---

## 3. Household & SME Focus
- The Commission specifically asked the EBA about **retail (household) and SME** green loans, reflecting the recognized gap in inclusive sustainable finance for smaller borrowers.  
- EBA analysis shows that **banks rarely** track or label green loans for SMEs—despite SMEs being critical to the decarbonization effort (and making up over half of Europe’s GDP).  
- For **households**, green mortgages (for energy-efficient homes or renovations) are the largest chunk of green lending; the EBA stresses the need for consistent energy performance data (e.g., EPCs) to confirm “green” status.

**Why It’s Useful for You**:  
It confirms that **SMEs and households** are a top policy priority, an essential demographic for meeting EU climate goals. Your aggregator solution can fill the exact gap identified—particularly by simplifying the data-collection and compliance for smaller-scale green loans.

---

## 4. Identified Barriers & Pain Points
- **Data & Documentation Gaps**: Banks struggle to verify energy performance or technical compliance (e.g., do-no-significant-harm (DNSH) checks).  
- **Complex Criteria**: The EU Taxonomy’s technical screening can be too detailed for typical retail/SME loan officers.  
- **Low Profit Margin for Small Loans**: Thorough green-lending assessments cost time and money; for small deals, banks see it as unprofitable.  
- **Consumer Awareness**: Many households/SMEs do not realize they could finance energy upgrades or retooling as “green.”

**Why It’s Useful for You**:  
Your platform can position itself to **solve** these exact hurdles by offering:
1. **Automated ROI/EPC verification** for retail mortgages,  
2. **Standard checklists** for SME project eligibility,  
3. A **one-stop** aggregator that drastically **lowers bank overhead** for small green loans.

---

## 5. Potential Incentives & Growth Levers
- EBA notes that **public support**—like interest rate subsidies, tax incentives, or partial guarantees—could accelerate green loans for households/SMEs.  
- Many banks said that a **common EU label** or “certification” would help standardize offerings.  
- The EBA sees significant future growth in green real estate loans, especially if the EU’s “Renovation Wave” and building-performance directives push owners to upgrade.

**Why It’s Useful for You**:  
Consider integrating or listing **public subsidies** in your aggregator, pairing your platform’s financing deals with local or EU-level incentives. This approach can **boost adoption** and demonstrate the “unlocking” of grants for end users.

---

## 6. Origination & Monitoring Best Practices
- The report encourages robust **due diligence**: verifying that the financed project meets “green” criteria (like energy performance thresholds).  
- It also highlights the importance of **monitoring** actual outcomes (e.g., energy savings).  
- Some banks do “use-of-proceeds” checks at origination but rarely follow up. The EBA sees follow-up or data-driven monitoring (like actual kWh savings) as crucial for genuine green integrity.

**Why It’s Useful for You**:  
Your aggregator can **embed** these best practices—like requiring actual EPC certificates or simplified periodic checks post-loan. That’s a major “value-add” to banks who want credible “green” metrics but lack the infrastructure.

---

## 7. Convergence with Other EU Initiatives
- The EBA references **EU Taxonomy** alignment, the **European Green Bond Standard**, the upcoming **Mortgage Credit Directive** review, and the **Consumer Credit Directive** recast, all of which relate to defining or incentivizing green finance.  
- This underscores that the policy environment is **evolving rapidly**, with potential new directives or guidelines that will likely demand more structured green-lending solutions.

**Why It’s Useful for You**:  
Your platform’s design can remain **modular** and updatable, ensuring readiness for future expansions (e.g., new building requirements or car electrification targets). Emphasizing compliance with “the direction of EU policy” bolsters your pitch to banks and regulators.

## How You Might Use These Findings
1. **Market Stats & Growth Potential**  
   - Reference the **4.5%** figure (green loans as a share of total) to illustrate the **nascent** but rapidly growing market.  
   - Show how an aggregator solution that simplifies data handling and compliance could unlock much more than 4.5%.

2. **Standardization**  
   - Cite the EBA’s call for a **voluntary green loan label** and highlight how Veridian’s platform effectively **pre-bakes** consistent definitions/eligibility checks, bridging that gap.

3. **SME & Household Emphasis**  
   - Stress the EBA’s finding that **small businesses and homeowners** face bigger hurdles. This is exactly where your aggregator can step in.

4. **Pain Points → Veridian Solutions**  
   - Provide explicit ways your tool addresses the EBA’s listed pain points: from automating energy performance checks to combining bank financing with local subsidies.

5. **Ongoing Regulatory Alignment**  
   - Mention the various directives (Green Bond Standard, Taxonomy disclosures, MCD, CCD) and how your system can keep banks **future-proof** as legislation evolves.

### In Short
From the attached EBA report, you can leverage:
- **Data**: Low current share of green loans, heavy reliance on internal definitions, limited uptake by SMEs, and the huge growth opportunity.  
- **Recommendations**: The EBA’s push for a common “green loan label” and more robust monitoring aligns with your aggregator’s “compliance + simplicity” angle.  
- **Pain Points**: Highlight the complexity and overhead banks face in verifying green eligibility. This precisely justifies Veridian’s streamlined approach.

Using these insights in your pitch or solution roadmap helps underscore that **Veridian** isn’t just another fintech idea—it directly tackles the real, documented challenges identified by EU regulators and the banking industry itself.
