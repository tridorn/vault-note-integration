### 0 | How to read this map  
1. **Horizontal Track** = _lifelong career “rail”_ (what kind of professional you are).  
2. **Vertical Grade** = _current mastery tier_ (how far you have progressed, irrespective of track).  
3. **Assignment Class** = _ephemeral tether_ (where your labour is currently applied).

Every person **must** hold **exactly one Horizontal** **and** **exactly one Vertical grade** at any moment;  
they may hold **zero or one Assignment** at a time.  
Horizontal × Vertical defines meritocracy; Assignment supplies transient utilisation.

## 1 | Horizontals — the four permanent career rails  

| Code | Horizontal Track | Core Value Proposition | Example Archetypes |
|------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **O** | **Officer Corps** | Leadership craft, doctrine carriage, venture origination | LFO, Task-Force Commander, AGS Cell-Chief |
| **S** | **Specialist Guild** | Deep functional excellence, technical authority | Senior Engineer, Growth Scientist, UX Lead |
| **I** | **Innovation Fellows** | Breakthrough R&D, disruptive concept incubation | Researcher, Prototype Hacker, Venture Architect |
| **B** | **Backbone Stewards** | Continuous enterprise services (OCD) & governance | Controller, HRBP, CISO, Legal Counsel |

*Track-switch is permitted, but only at grade-transition reviews (never mid-tour).*

---

## 2 | Verticals — unified mastery ladder (shared by all tracks)

| Grade | Tag | Merit Focus | Typical Span of Control | Promotion Gate |
|-------|-----|-------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **V-0** | Novitiate | Foundational craft & culture absorption | Self | Complete onboarding academy |
| **V-1** | Practitioner | Independent delivery of discrete work-packages | Own tasks / 1 sprint | 2 × positive tour evals |
| **V-2** | Lead | End-to-end ownership of a deliverable or mini-team | ≤ 8 people / 1 AMU | Mission KPI ≥ 100 % + peer 360 |
| **V-3** | Senior Lead | Multi-AMU or domain squad orchestration | 2–3 AMUs or function pod | Pass “Doctrine Board” |
| **V-4** | Principal | Task-Force / Cell command, policy influence | 20–50 staff, budget | P&L or strategic OKR hit |
| **V-5** | Executive | Strategic-Command or AGS chief, corporate officer | 50 + staff & cross-domain | Council vote + Board ratify |
| **V-6** | Councillor | Leadership-Council seat / corporate fiduciary | Enterprise-wide | Shareholder or Board election |

**Mapping examples**

* An **O-V2** = Field-Officer (classical LFO).  
* An **S-V4** = Principal Engineer.  
* An **I-V3** = Senior Innovation Fellow overseeing three experiment AMUs.  
* A **B-V5** = Chief Financial Officer.

## 3 | Assignments — singular, non-overlapping utilisation classes  

| Code | Assignment Class | Duration Band | Authority Inside Node | Primary Use-case |
|------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **A1** | **Core Seat** | Equals node life-span | Full vote & delivery duty | AMU member, Task-Force staff, AGS officer |
| **A2** | **Rotator** | 1–3 sprints | Temporary vote | Skill-building tour, fresh eyes |
| **A3** | **Flash-Embed** | ≤ 72 h | Tactical obedience | Crisis repair, hot-fix |
| **A4** | **Adviser** | Episodic (hours) | Consultative, non-binding | Specialist review, board mentor |
| **A5** | **Liaison** | Mission-linked | Procedural, no vote | Partner sync, security hand-shake |
| **A6** | **Embedded Contractor** | ≤ Mission | Operational, bounded by SOW | Freelance designer, contract dev |
| **A7** | **Fractional Exec** | Retainer (months) | Advisory + domain veto | Part-time CFO, DPO |
| **A8** | **Partner-Pod** | SOW window | Autonomy on tactics; KR bound | Agency delivering ad-campaign |
| **A9** | **Audit / Compliance** | Scheduled or trigger | Investigative | Internal audit, privacy review |
| **A10** | **Secretariat** | Indefinite | Admin only | EA, Chief-of-Staff |
| **Ø** | **None** | — | — | Staff not actively assigned (talent pool) |

*Each active node (AMU, TF, etc.) lists all A1–A8 attachments in its header block.*

## 4 | Promotion & Up-or-Out rhythm (meritocratic flywheel)

1. **Tour Length Standard** = _2 × sprints_ for V-0/1; _1 × mission_ for V-2 +  
2. **After-Action Review** scores Outcome, Doctrine, Leadership (weight 40/30/30).  
3. **Score < 70 %** triggers **Probation Tour**; two consecutive < 70 % ⇒ *exit or demote*.  
4. **Score 90 % + & tenure met** ⇒ eligible for **Promotion Board**.  
5. **Promotion Board** includes cross-track peer & one grade-senior officers → maintain objectivity.  

Up-or-out thus remains humane yet uncompromising: only **demonstrated excellence** advances.

## 5 | Role–Assignment Interaction Matrix (simplified)

| Vertical Grade | Officer (O) | Specialist (S) | Innovator (I) | Backbone (B) |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| V-0 | A1 (AMU member) | A1 | A1 | A1 |
| V-1 | A1 / A2 | A1 / A2 | A1 / A2 | A1 |
| V-2 | **A1 (LFO)**, A3 | Lead Dev (A1) | Exp. Lead (A1) | Ops Lead (A1) |
| V-3 | Task-Force XO (A1) | Principal SME (A1/A4) | Lab Lead (A1) | Function Manager (A1) |
| V-4 | Command CO (A1) | Distinguished Fellow (A4) | Venture Director (A1) | Dept. Head (A1) |
| V-5 | AGS Chief (A1) | Chief Architect (A4) | Incubator GM (A1) | Corporate Officer (A1) |

Assignments A6–A8 appear cross-track as supply, not hierarchy.

---

## 6 | Cultural Guard-rails  

* **Doctrine Academy** mandatory at entry & every grade jump.  
* **Cross-Track Sabbaticals** encouraged but capped (≤ 1 per four years).  
* **Rank Indicators** affixed in Notion People DB & Slack name (e.g. `O-V3 ▸ Alice Rossi`).  
* **“No-Title Inflation”** — internal rank ≠ external job title; outward HR titles mapped prudently.

---

### 7 | Outcome  
You now have a **logically separated, mutually exclusive** lattice:

* **Horizontals** ensure talent specialisation & identity.  
* **Verticals** ensure merit-based progression.  
* **Assignments** ensure fluid deployment without muddling career rails.

Result: a *company of commanders*—every participant can see **exactly** where they stand, how to rise, and where their transient labour is being spent.
