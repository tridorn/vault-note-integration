Better: "Define an operational reading protocol for extracting maximum leverage from a book, integrating the workbook, index cards, and markdown vault. Specify stages, artefacts, constraints, and review loops."

  

Here is the end-to-end sequence for working with a book in your rebuilt system. This is tuned for your two-books-per-week cadence and your control-plane workbook.

* * *

## 1. Pre-read setup

  

Purpose: eliminate drift, set extraction targets.

- Source dossier stub: in /sources/ create a src-book-... file with bibliographic data, blank High-signal pages section, and a Notes section ready for links.
- Define intent: in workbook, open a [REF] thread: short ID, book title, why you are reading it, what decisions or projects it could influence.
- Constraints: decide your per-chapter capture cap (max 10 kept notes), and one "primary hunt" (e.g. pricing tactics, discovery scripts).
* * *

## 2. First pass reading (analogue capture)

  

Purpose: capture signals without over-processing.

- Read with index cards beside you.
- One idea per card. Use short IDs on the spot: YYDOY-SS.
- On each card front: title (3--6 words), statement, evidence. Leave implication blank unless it's obvious immediately.
- In margins or card corners, mark type with shape code (dot = principle, slash = pattern, square = metric, triangle = question).
- Workbook role here: only meta-threads, e.g. [LOG] 25227-01 Lean Analytics focus on OMTM, chapters 3--4 most relevant to Q3 tracking. No full notes.
* * *

## 3. Immediate post-chapter distillation

  

Purpose: keep only high-signal ideas, add implications.

- At the end of each chapter or reading session, sort cards into keep/cull piles. Target ≤ 10 kept per chapter.
- On kept cards, complete "Implication" and "Next" on back.
- For any decision-level idea, open a [DEC] or [Q] thread in the workbook with short ID, context, and implication.
- Photograph all kept cards into /_inbox immediately.
* * *

## 4. Daily sweep and encoding

  

Purpose: integrate into canonical vault before ideas go stale.

- For each kept card:

    - Create an atomic note in /notes/ using full timestamp ID.

    - Add statement, evidence, implication, action.

    - Tag with closed vocabulary and link to any relevant maps or projects.
- Update the source dossier in /sources/ with high-signal pages and links to new notes.
- For workbook DEC or EXP threads related to the book, create decision records or experiment specs as appropriate. Add full IDs in workbook margins.
* * *

## 5. Application within 72h

  

Purpose: avoid "concept museum" syndrome.

- Choose at least one Play or Principle from the book to test in a live project that same week.
- Document this as an experiment in /experiments/ or as a step in a project file.
- Link outcomes back to the note(s) in the vault.
* * *

## 6. Review loop

  

Purpose: reinforce retention and track utility.

- Put the 3--5 most critical cards into your Leitner box for spaced review (Slots 1--5).
- In the monthly audit, check the book's source dossier:

    - Which notes were linked into active projects?

    - Which remained unused? Archive unused after 60 days unless they are durable principles.
* * *

## 7. Time allocation for your 3.5-day window

- Day 1: first pass reading + card capture for first half of book. End with chapter-level distillation.
- Day 2: finish reading + distillation for second half. Daily sweep → encode first half's cards.
- Day 3: encode second half's cards. Identify and launch one application test.
- Half-day: write a 200-word synthesis in the source dossier, link into at least one map, and close all workbook threads opened for this book.
* * *

## Key constraints to enforce

- Max 10 kept notes per chapter.
- Encode latency under 48h from capture.
- One tested Play per book within the same week.
- Archive notes unused after 60 days unless foundational.
* * *

If you want, I can give you a side-by-side visual flow showing workbook, cards, and vault interactions for this reading protocol so you can see the capture--distil--encode--apply loop at a glance. That would make operationalising this trivial.
