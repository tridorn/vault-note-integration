love this kind of rethink. here's a clean, job‑oriented foundation you can build everything else on. it's intentionally minimal and composable--just the primitives a note needs to do its work.

  

# The core jobs of a note (primitives)

1. Identify

What is this thing--unambiguously?

Minimal keys: id, title, type, aliases

2. Intend

Why does this note exist? What outcome or question drives it?

Minimal keys: purpose, question, desired_outcome

3. Contain

What's the substance you'd keep even if everything else vanished?

Minimal keys: summary, canonical_content_ref (pointer to body)

4. Connect

How does this note relate to other things (graph + structure)?

Minimal keys: parents, children, related, tags

5. Track (State)

Where is it in its lifecycle, and who's on the hook?

Minimal keys: stage, status, owner, due (optional)

6. Prove (Provenance)

Where did this come from and who touched it?

Minimal keys: sources, author, created, modified

7. Govern (Policy)

What are the rules/constraints for handling it?

Minimal keys: sensitivity, license, sharing_scope, retention

8. Observe (Signals)

What signals tell us if it's useful or active?

Minimal keys: last_opened, open_count, quality_score (optional)

9. Act (Operations)

What actions can/should be run against it?

Minimal keys: actions (named ops like export/sync), automation_triggers

# Suggested H2 blocks to mirror the YAML (one per primitive)

- ## Identify
- ## Intend
- ## Contain
- ## Connect
- ## Track
- ## Prove
- ## Govern
- ## Observe
- ## Act

  

That's it--nine primitives, no overlap, each answering a different question: what, why, what's inside, how it relates, where it is, where it came from, how to handle it, how it's behaving, and what to do next. If you want, I can sketch a tiny YAML template that maps cleanly to these without over‑specifying.
