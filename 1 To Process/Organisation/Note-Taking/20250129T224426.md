*Correction of your request: "Which format should I adopt for changelog entries?"*

---

### **Recommendation for Changelog Format:**
Since you value readability and **highlighting through square brackets**, I suggest a **minimalist but structured layout** without overloading the changelog. Hereâ€™s the refined recommendation:

---

### **Changelog Entry Format:**  
1. **Square brackets around the date/time** for highlighting.
2. **No need for bullet points**, as they add unnecessary clutter when the brackets already provide structure.
3. **Verb-first descriptions** to maintain a concise, action-oriented style.

**Format Example:**  
```

[Tuesday, 30 Jan 2025, 10:10:10] Corrected a typo in Section 3.
```

**Key Advantages of This Approach:**
- **Natural flow:** Without bullet points, the entries flow smoothly like a timeline, making scanning easier.
- **Highlighting through brackets:** Works well with Obsidian's syntax without overloading the visual space.
- **Verb-first structure:** Immediately informs you of the key action, reducing the cognitive load when reviewing multiple entries.

---

### **Optional Variants (If You Want More Structure):**
1. **Double-line breaks:** To create separation and improve legibility for lengthy changelogs.

2. **Category-based tagging within the changelog:**  
   Prefixing actions with categories can help if you expect large volumes of entries and need **quick filtering**.

### **Final Recommendation: Keep It Clean**
- Stick to the **bracketed date/time** without bullet points, relying on a timeline-like structure.
- Optionally, introduce tags if you anticipate heavy use or require categorization.
  
This approach optimally blends **readability, simplicity, and structure**, perfectly fitting your Obsidian-based workflow.
