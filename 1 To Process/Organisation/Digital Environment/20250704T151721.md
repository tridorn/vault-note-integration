_Correction:_  
A sharper prompt would read: _"Design from first principles an integrated device architecture that replaces my ad-hoc hardware sprawl, delivers sovereign control, creative capability, and friction-free mobility, while minimising account chaos."_

* * *

## 1 Principled Constraints

1. **Mission Segmentation** Dev / Ops, Creative, Mobility, Personal.

2. **Sovereignty** Full local control for strategic data; no silent vendor drift.

3. **Inter-operability** Must open Adobe files, Office decks, and run Linux-native tool-chains.

4. **Operational Tempo** Fast context-switching; zero-day rebuilds; polyphasic schedule.

5. **Asset Longevity** Five-year hardware horizon; upgradeable where possible.

## 2 Device Roles ("Rings")

| Ring | Purpose | Form-Factor | OS | Why | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **R-0 "Sovereign Node"** | Source-of-truth workstation, automation, infra | Desktop tower | **NixOS (primary) + Windows 11 (secondary disk)** | Deterministic builds, rollback, heavy compute, GPU passthrough for design tasks | 
| **R-1 "Field Node"** | Mobile coding / writing / ops | 16″ modular laptop (Framework 16 or ThinkPad P/T) | **NixOS** | Upgradeable, Linux-certified, full keyboard, 10 h battery ([blog.jonsdocs.org.uk](https://blog.jonsdocs.org.uk/2024/07/06/framework-16-laptop-after-four-weeks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | 
| **R-2 "Creative Terminal"** | Design, video, keynote delivery | 16″ MacBook Pro M4 Max | **macOS** | Runs full Adobe / Final Cut stack at desktop-class speed; best screen & battery ([apple.com](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | 
| **R-3 "Quick-strike Pad"** | Drafting, markup, meetings | 13″ iPad Pro + Magic Keyboard | **iPadOS** | Instant on, pencil input, LTE fallback | 
| **R-4 "Comm Beacon"** | Messaging, 2FA, capture | iPhone (-latest) | iOS | Ubiquitous apps, eSIM roaming, secure enclave | 

Retire Chromebook and Surface; they duplicate Rings 1-3 without advantage.

## 3 Identity & Account Topology

| Layer | Accounts | Storage | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Org** | Company SSO (Entra ID / Google Work) | Nextcloud + MinIO (self-hosted) | 
| **Ops** | GitHub Enterprise, Terraform Cloud | Private repos, encrypted secrets | 
| **Creative** | Adobe ID, Apple ID-Work | iCloud-Work (design files only) | 
| **Personal** | Personal Apple ID, ProtonMail | Syncthing mesh, Photos | 

**Credential spine:** 1Password Business; enforce passkeys + hardware U2F (YubiKey 5C).
* * *

## 4 Data Flow & Sync Discipline

- **Sovereign Data (Obsidian vault, strategy docs)**

    - Lives on R-0 (LUKS disk)

    - Syncthing selective-sync to R-1, R-3 (read-only)

    - Cold Borg backup to offline USB monthly.
- **Creative Assets**

    - Produced on R-2, mirrored to Nextcloud.

    - Mounted read-only in NixOS via WebDAV for website builds.
- **Operational Repos**

    - Git (self-hosted) mirrors on R-0 and R-1; Flake-based system configs.

## 5 Minimal Hardware Bill-of-Materials

| Ring | Suggested Model | Key Spec | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| R-0 | AMD Ryzen 9 9750X / 64 GB ECC / 2× NVMe (NixOS, Win) / RTX 5090 | PCIe bifurcation for VFIO | 
| R-1 | Framework 16 (Ryzen 9 7840HS, 64 GB, 2 TB) | Repairable, Linux-endorsed ([blog.jonsdocs.org.uk](https://blog.jonsdocs.org.uk/2024/07/06/framework-16-laptop-after-four-weeks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | 
| R-2 | MacBook Pro 16, M4 Max 16-core CPU / 40-core GPU / 64 GB RAM | Up to 18 h battery, color-accurate Mini-LED ([apple.com](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | 
| R-3 | iPad Pro 13 (M4) + Magic Keyboard + Apple Pencil 3 | 120 Hz OLED | 
| R-4 | iPhone 17 Pro Max | Dual-eSIM, USB-C | 

* * *

## 6 Execution Roadmap

1. **Phase-in R-0**: build desktop, deploy dual-disk NixOS/Win, house GitOps repo.

2. **Clone Flake to R-1**: test full mobility week; refine modules.

3. **Acquire R-2**: migrate Adobe + Keynote work; lock to Apple ID-Work.

4. **Decommission legacy hardware** once workflows stabilise.

5. **Quarterly audit** of device firmware, Flake versions, credential roster.

## 7 Why This Stack Works

- **Sovereign Core** -- deterministic Nix nodes anchor infra.
- **Creative Edge** -- macOS node handles proprietary media.
- **Mobility** -- iPad Pro covers 80 % daily light work at <1 kg.
- **Identity Hygiene** -- single password vault, hardware tokens, clear domain separation.
- **Upgrade Path** -- modular laptop and desktop components extend lifecycle; only Apple devices on fixed two-year refresh.

Adopt this architecture and the account/device sprawl collapses into **one deterministic core, one creative satellite, and two mobility appendages**--each justified by first-principles function rather than legacy happenstance.
