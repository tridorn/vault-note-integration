# Projects

---

## Overview

Projects in this context loosely follow the definition of GTD. Stuff that needs more than one action to complete is considered a project.

Projects are the main active component of the system, whenever something needs to be worked on, a project is created with everything relevant.

---

## What Constitutes a Project

The active component of the project, the tasks (actions) to be completed in order to advance its states are handled in the task management system, currently Apple Reminders.

Reference for the project is held in folders in every system that adopts PARA, currently Obsidian and OneDrive, and beyond, currently Drafts.  
The main reference folders are:

1. **Documentation**: Notes on the project
2. **Assets**: Every asset needed to support the project
3. **Source**: The core working space and reference area for items that are being worked on
4. **Output**: The output is what the work in source has yielded
5. **Archive**: An archive area specifically project, as not every item might be of value for work, yet might be kept around for historic purpose

## Metadata of a Project

Every project has a few key information to help analyse them better:

A **project number**. The number is composed of the last two letters of the year (so 24 for 2024) and the approximate day number for (so 015 for 15th January), for when it had been started. Approximate only, as project numbers have to be *unique*. For every project a number as close to the starting day should be picked.

An **overview**. The overview wraps the purpose of the project in a short description.

A **starting date**. The actual date the project has been started in the format of YYYY-MM-dd.

An **end date**. The actual date the project has been completed in the format of YYYY-MM-dd
