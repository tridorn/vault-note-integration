# Directive of [[year]]

## Pre-Execution (Year Planning)

### Core Strategic Objectives (3-5)
<!-- Define **3-5 high-impact objectives** for the year. These should focus on **capability development, major resource shifts, and long-term positioning**, rather than daily execution. -->
- [ ] 

### Macro-Trajectory Alignment
<!-- How does this year's focus align with **long-term positioning (5-year, 10-year objectives)?** Identify **structural shifts** required. -->
- 

### Key Capability & Knowledge Development
<!-- What **new skills, expertise, or intellectual capital** need to be built this year? (e.g., technical skills, leadership, finance, market specialisation). -->
- 

### Major Resource Allocation (Time, Money, Network)

- **Time Allocation Strategy:**  
  <!-- Where should **time investments** be reallocated? What should be cut? -->
  - 
- **Financial Investment Strategy:**  
  <!-- What **major financial bets** should be made this year? (e.g., business investment, market entry, personal asset building). -->
  - 
- **Network & Relationship Focus:**  
  <!-- Which **high-value relationships** should be built or strengthened? -->
  -

## Execution (Mid-Year Strategic Checkpoint)

### Emerging Patterns & Macro-Course Correction
<!-- What trajectory patterns are emerging? Are strategic objectives still valid, or should **mid-year adjustments** be made? -->
- 

### Structural Adjustments for Next 6 Months
<!-- What **major operational or strategic corrections** should be made? Consider shifting focus, resource redistribution, or dropping ineffective initiatives. -->

### Strategic Effectiveness Assessment
<!-- Did the **expected strategic outcomes** materialize? -->

- Objective 1: 
- Objective 2:  
- Objective 3:  
- Objective 4:  
- Objective 5:  

### Long-Term Structural Refinements
<!-- What **macro-level structural optimizations** should be made before moving into the next year? -->
- 

### High-Impact Experimentation for Next Year
<!-- What **one major strategic experiment** will be tested next year? This should be a **structural or systemic bet**, such as entering a new field, launching a venture, or rearchitecting a personal/professional framework. -->
