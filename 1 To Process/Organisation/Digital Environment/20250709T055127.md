Ah, now I get it -- you're asking:

> "What else in _my entire digital life_ could I manage the way I manage NixOS--declaratively, reproducibly, and versioned?"

That's a powerful question. Let's zoom out. You're not just managing a Linux system anymore -- you're thinking like someone managing **a personal digital stack**. That includes _devices, data, workflows, services, and environments._

Here's a curated list of **things you might want to "infrastructurize"** (make declarative, version-controlled, and/or reproducible) -- even beyond NixOS.
* * *

## 🧠 1. **Knowledge & Creativity Infrastructure**

| Category | Description | Tools to use | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| ✅ Obsidian Vault | Already versioned notes, great! | Git, Syncthing, Dropbox | 
| 📚 Bookmarks & Reading Lists | Versioned knowledge sources | Linkding (self-hosted), Raindrop.io API + JSON backup | 
| 📝 Writing/Blog | Static site for notes/blog | Hugo, Zola, Eleventy + Git | 
| 🎞️ Video/Audio Notes | Declarative media tagging & storage | Exiftool, beets (for music), Syncthing, Jellyfin | 
| 📦 Zettelkasten or PKM structure | Track structure/changes in your knowledge system | Git, YAML frontmatter, custom scripts | 

* * *

## 💻 2. **Development Environment**

| Category | Description | Tools | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 🧪 Dev Envs per Project | Version each env for projects | `nix-shell`, Flakes | 
| 🐳 Containers | Reproducible services or apps | Docker + Compose files, Nix with `buildDockerImage` | 
| 🧪 Testing Infra | Local automated tests | Nix + `nixos-test` or `pytest`, CI | 
| 🛠️ Git Hooks | Automate checks | Husky, `.git/hooks`, Nix wrapper | 
| 📜 Scripts & CLI Tools | Version your CLI helpers | Git repo + symlinks + Home Manager | 
* * *

## 🌐 3. **Self-Hosted or Cloud Services**

| Category | Description | Tools | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| ☁️ Self-Hosted Tools | Host your own tools like Nextcloud, Gitea, Linkding, etc. | Docker Compose, NixOps, Ansible | 
| 📤 Deployments | Deploy infra declaratively | Terraform, NixOps, deploy-rs | 
| 🛡️ DNS & SSL | Track domain config | `terraform`, `lego`, Cloudflare API | 
| 💬 Messaging | Host Matrix, Rocket.chat, or Mastodon | Ansible, Docker | 
| 📬 Email Infra | Run your own mail | Mail-in-a-box, Mailcow (infrastructure heavy!) | 

* * *

## 🧳 4. **Personal Workflows**

| Category | Description | Tools | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| ✅ Task Management | Track to-dos versionably | Taskwarrior, Org-mode, Obsidian Tasks | 
| 📅 Calendar | Self-hosted & backup-friendly | Radicale (CalDAV), ICS sync to Git | 
| 📈 Habits / Journals | Reproducible personal trackers | Markdown + Git, Dataview in Obsidian | 
| 🧘‍♂️ Mindfulness / Time Tracking | Track logs or time | Wakatime, Toggl API + exporter, Custom logs in Obsidian | 
* * *

## 🔐 5. **Security & Secrets Management**

| Category | Description | Tools | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 🔑 Passwords | Versioned, encrypted | `pass` + Git | 
| 🔐 API Keys | Declarative secret management | `sops` (with Nix), `age`, `gopass` | 
| 🔍 Auditing Auth | Keep track of where you use which secrets | Markdown doc or Git-tracked vault | 
| 🔍 Login Infrastructure | Declarative SSH, 2FA keys, and dotfiles | Nix + `ssh-agent`, YubiKey rules in NixOS | 
* * *

## 💽 6. **Data, Media & Backup Infrastructure**

| Category | Description | Tools | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 📁 Syncing & Backup | Declarative backup jobs | Restic, Borg, Syncthing, Rclone | 
| 🖼️ Photo/Video Archives | Structured media + tags | Digikam, Exiftool, beets | 
| 📦 Dotfile backups | Already versioned | Git | 
| ⏳ Snapshots | OS-level rollback | Btrfs/ZFS, systemd timers | 
| 🌍 Multi-device sync | Share across laptop, phone, tablet | Syncthing, Git remotes, WebDAV | 

* * *

## 🧪 7. **Automation & Monitoring**

| Category | Description | Tools | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 🤖 Task automation | Run tasks on schedule | systemd timers, cron, `task`, `justfile` | 
| 📊 Monitoring | Track system usage or health | Prometheus + Grafana (heavy), simple scripts with logs | 
| 💌 Notifications | Alert on changes or failures | ntfy.sh, Apprise, custom webhooks | 
| 🧪 CI/CD Pipelines | Run tests/builds automatically | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, `nix build` in CI | 

* * *

## 🧰 Bonus: Meta-Infrastructure

| What | Idea | 
| ---- | ----  |
| 🔄 Infrastructure for your infrastructure | A Git repo that ties together all the above (meta-repo) | 
| 🗃️ Docs for yourself | Maintain markdown documentation for how your stack works | 
| 📚 Reproducible bootstrap | Scripts or guides to rebuild your entire environment from scratch (on new laptop, for instance) | 

* * *

## 🛣️ Want a Starter Plan?

Here's what **you could implement next**, roughly in order:

1. ✅ **Dotfiles repo** → version with Git, symlink or manage via Home Manager.

2. 🏠 **Home Manager** → move user config to Nix.

3. 🛠️ **Per-project `nix-shell`/flakes** → isolate dev environments.

4. 📦 **Encrypted secrets in Git** → using `sops` or `pass`.

5. 📤 **Backups (Restic/Borg)** → schedule automatic runs to local or cloud.

6. 📚 **Versioned knowledge assets** → bookmarks, reading lists, journal.

7. 📟 **Optional CI/CD** → test/build personal projects or config in GitHub Actions.
