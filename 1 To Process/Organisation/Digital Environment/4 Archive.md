# Archive

---

## Overview

The archive not only holds any note that is out-of-date or has a newer version, it holds all notes that have at least a minimum of historic value.

Notes and files are archived based on their **context and creation date**. The archive follows [[0 Meta|Meta]] in structure, that is, it's structured around hierarchical timeframes. While Meta holds the notes and files of the current timeframe, archive holds notes and files of previous timeframes.
Meta follows a **conveyor belt** approach, where notes and files get moved upwards, inwards, or deleted on the reviews of their respective timeframes.
Archive on the other hands categorises based on context first and then timeframe.[^1] Context here means the timeframe that is most relevant to the file or note. What's most relevant is subject to local assessment. Generally speaking a note/file should be filed under day, things such as projects might be filed under year, a review of the year under year correspondingly

## Changelog

- **Saturday, 25 January 2025, 05:53:07 UTC+01:00**: Created note and archived old version
- **Saturday, 25 January 2025, 06:21:28 UTC+01:00**: Added short introduction
- **[Saturday, 12 Apr 2025, 15:14:28]** Added minor things to make ready for integration. Integrated note
- **[Friday, 18 Apr 2025, 18:32:44]** Changed archive from the year-month of creation filing structure to the new timeframe-based approach

[^1]: the relevant problem here is that any note/file could be filed any under timeframe it was created in, a note created on 01.01.2024 could be filed under day (01.), the first week of 2024, January of 2024, and so on. That is why context is necessary
