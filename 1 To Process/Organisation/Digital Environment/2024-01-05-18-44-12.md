## Definition

Templates are notes used as the base for the creation or supplement of other notes.

---

## Introduction

Templates are reglemented by [[Templates in Note-Taking System]].  
They have a somewhat special place and need to be handled slightly different than regular notes as they are used as schemes for the creation of new notes. They contain functions that are run on note-creation and as such special mind has to be paid to not *replace* these commands by mistake (for example by the use of a linter). The note titles are also regular ones instead of following the general naming scheme of time and date of creation as file name and title as the only header 1.
