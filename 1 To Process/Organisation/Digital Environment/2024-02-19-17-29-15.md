# Topic Tags

---

## Introduction

Topic tags are keywords assigned to content of any form to categorise it and foster searchability based on its topic.

---

## Type of Structure

Some notes have an overarching structure, beyond the classic confines of the [[Note-Taking System]] - they serve a bigger purpose.

## Directive

A [[2024-02-20-21-02-48|Directive]] is a guideline I personally have to follow. They are enacted and if I don't follow them I am in breach of the specific directive and have to endure the consequences. There currently are two types of directives, one for my personal day to day (which won't be found here in Obsidian as they are located in Drafts), and another one for the personal productivity systems I use.

- #directive/personal
- #directive/system

## Type of Medium

Not every note comes from the vast depths of my towering intellect, wildly speculating and always unsourced. Some actually have a researched base.

## Type of Topic

The base interpretation of Topic Tags are tags categorising the topic (well, all of the other tags here are also tags on the topic, but this topic tag type has extra topic). All the other types mentioned in this note come closer to [[2024-02-19-16-38-59|Administrative Tags]] in scope, as they categorise the content more on a meta layer while this type

## Creating Topic Tags

Creating descriptive keywords or tags can be challenging at first, but with practice, it becomes easier. Here are some tips for generating useful tags for your notes:

1. **Think in terms of concepts**: Consider the main ideas, themes, or concepts in your note. What are the central topics or points that the note covers? Use these as tags.
	 
2. **Use keywords from the content**: Skim through the note and identify specific terms or phrases that stand out or are frequently mentioned. These can often be good candidates for tags.
	 
3. **Consider synonyms**: Think about alternative words or phrases that describe the same concept as your original tags. This can help capture a wider range of related content when searching or filtering.
	 
4. **Use broader and narrower terms**: When appropriate, use both broader and narrower terms as tags. This can help capture notes that are related at different levels of granularity.
	 
5. **Limit the number of tags**: Try to keep the number of tags per note manageable. Aim for 3 to 7 tags, but this can vary depending on the complexity of the note. Too many tags can make it difficult to organize and search your notes effectively.
	 
6. **Keep tags consistent**: Use consistent terminology and spelling across your notes. This makes it easier to find related content when searching or filtering by tags.
