# Directive of [[week]] 

--- 

## Pre-Execution (Planning the Week)

### Core Operational Goals (3-5)
<!-- Define 3-5 key operational goals for the week. These should focus on **process improvements, efficiency gains, and workload allocation**, not just tasks. -->
- [ ] 

### Systemic Inefficiencies to Address
<!-- What recurring inefficiencies from tactical timeframes (daily reviews) must be corrected this week? Focus on patterns, not single-instance execution issues. -->
- 

### Process Adjustments & Resource Allocation
<!-- What larger workflow/process adjustments need implementation? Consider workload balancing, bottleneck mitigation, and time allocation. -->
- 

---

## Execution (Mid-Week Review)

### Emerging Patterns in Execution
<!-- What trends are emerging? Are specific execution issues recurring (slow decision-making, misalignment of priorities, bottlenecks)? -->
- 

### Mid-Week Course Correction
<!-- What process refinement or workload reallocation is necessary? Adjust execution structure if needed. -->
-

## Post-Execution Review (End-of-Week Operational Optimisation)

### Efficiency Analysis (Where Did Execution Falter?)

- Goal 1: 
- Goal 2:
- Goal 3:
- Goal 4:
- Goal 5:

### Process Optimisations for Next Week
<!-- What inefficiencies must be systematically addressed next week? Focus on structural adjustments rather than individual task failures. -->
- 

### Operational Iteration Commitment
<!-- What **one major process experiment** will be implemented next week to optimise execution? This should be a structural change, not a minor adjustment. -->
