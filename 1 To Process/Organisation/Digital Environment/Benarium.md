# Benarium

---

## Overview

This note is the first point of contact with this vault, the entry gate to all other notes. All note should link back to this one one way or the or the other.

---

## Name Rational

Why **Benarium**?
No true deeper meaning to it other than I like the sound and it think its a great name to describe my body of knowledge.

---

## Folder Structure

The folders structure is based on the **PARA system** by Tiago Forte. It is complimented by my own creation, the workbench of this vault,[[0 Meta|Meta]].

1. [[0 Meta|Meta]]: Meta is structured around timeframes. Hierarchical spans of times with folders containing everything relevant to that timeframe, planning, reviews, reflections, etc.
2. [[1 Projects|Projects]]: Endeavours of clearly defined scope, less than year
3. [[2 Areas|Areas]]: Areas that need continuous attention
4. [[3 Resources|Resources]]: Static reference
5. [[4 Archive|Archive]]: Notes no longer relevant

Folders are prefixed using a system that shows their relative place in the structure.

---

## Logical Structure

The logical structure is the structure of how notes are linked and related, topically. The logical structure is based on [[20250412T133708|Meta-Clusters]], top-level categories that don't represent to capture every topic in an objective scope, but are based on my **personal preferences** and needs.

- Thinking Tools: Operating system, how I process, not what
- Knowledge Domains: The content
- Humans: The self, the body, the inner world
- Social: How humans organise, interact, build, and collapse
- Making & Building: Applied knowledge
- Time & Change: Cycles, history, transformation
- Language: Means of expression
- Myth & Meaning: Symbolic systems, archetypes, fiction, philosophy
- Meta-Structures: Frameworks

Each of these meta-clusters has clearly delineated **sub-categories**. This two-level structure is used to **orient** myself, not to box myself in
