You're down to two _excellent_ choices--and both _Eudaimon_ and _Arete_ are deeply rooted in Stoic philosophy. Here's a quick breakdown to help you choose based on nuance:

* * *

### 🌀 **Eudaimon**

- **Meaning**: "Blessed with a good spirit"; often interpreted as _human flourishing_ or _a life well lived_.
- **Stoic relevance**: It's the **end goal** in Stoicism--living in accordance with nature and reason to achieve a flourishing life.
- **Vibe**: Holistic, serene, aspirational. Think _life compass_, _guiding spirit_, _internal clarity_.
- **Personality**: If your vault is your compass, your place for reflection, journaling, and life strategy--this _radiates purpose_.

> ✅ **Pick this if:** your vault supports your whole life system--reflection, values, growth, clarity.
* * *

### 🛡️ **Arete**

- **Meaning**: "Excellence," "virtue," or "fulfilling your highest potential."
- **Stoic relevance**: It's **how you live**--virtue is the _only_ good, according to the Stoics.
- **Vibe**: Active, sharp, noble. It's a standard to rise to--focused, disciplined, honorable.
- **Personality**: If your vault feels like a forge of self-discipline, learning, progress tracking--this _embodies striving_.

> ✅ **Pick this if:** your vault is where you _train your mind_, refine your thinking, and pursue excellence.
* * *

### 🔮 Final Thoughts

- **Eudaimon** = your _why_
- **Arete** = your _how_

If you're leaning toward emotional resonance and long-term flourishing, go with **Eudaimon**.  
If you're drawn to focus, clarity, and self-mastery, go with **Arete**.

They're both beautiful and timeless. If you can see your vault as a place you'll return to daily for _decades_--which name makes you smile _more_ when you imagine opening it?

Let me know what you pick. I'd love to hear.
