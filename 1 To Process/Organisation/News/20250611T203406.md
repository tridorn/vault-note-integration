A more precise phrasing would be:  
**"I just came across Hacker News (by Y Combinator). What other platforms or resources offer similarly high-signal, source-proximate insight--whether in news, discourse, or beyond?"**

Here's a strategic classification of peer-grade sources, each optimized for proximity to frontier activity, early signal detection, or access to elite discourse:

* * *

### 1. **Direct Intelligence Platforms (Signal-Over-Noise Prioritised)**

- **[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)**  
Early-stage tech + founder-first discourse. Raw and often first-sourced.
- **[Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/)**  
Similar to HN but more technically rigorous, focused on systems, infosec, backend.

- **[Reddit: /r/technology, /r/programming, /r/startups, /r/financialindependence](https://reddit.com/)**  
Noisy but contains frontier insights. Use RES + curated sub feeds to extract value.
- **[Ben Thompson's Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/)**  
Long-form strategic insight on tech and media industries. Elite-grade synthesis.

- **[Matt Levine (Money Stuff)](https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/money-stuff)**  
Possibly the highest-leverage finance newsletter--law, markets, and manipulation decoded.

* * *

### 2. **Frontline Research / Engineering Knowledge**

- **[arXiv Sanity Preserver](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)**  
Curated, ranked machine learning and AI research papers. Signal extraction from academic glut.

- **[Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)**  
Connects ML papers with working implementations. High execution utility.

- **[LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/)**  
Rationalist thinking, alignment, long-horizon forecasting, epistemic rigor.

- **[Distill](https://distill.pub/)** _(now archived but valuable)_  
Deep visual explanations of ML. High fidelity in both form and content.

* * *

### 3. **Operator + Founder Insight Loops**
- **[First Round Review](https://review.firstround.com/)**  
Tactical knowledge from startup operators. Non-theoretical, non-performative.

- **[Every.to](https://every.to/)**  
Bundle of newsletters. Mixed signal, but some (e.g. Divinations, Napkin Math) offer rare founder-operator insight.

- **[Paul Graham Essays](http://paulgraham.com/)**  
Still foundational. Stripped down to conceptual primitives that remain durable.

- **[Alex Danco](https://alexdanco.com/)**  
Cultural and economic analysis from within tech finance. Good for edge-theory digestion.

* * *

### 4. **Elite Discourse & Institutional Memory**

- **[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/)**  
Curated longform. Not tech-specific, but high editorial signal.

- **[Noema Magazine](https://www.noemamag.com/)**  
Macro + philosophical vectors. Useful for long-range context.
- **[Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/)**  
For power analysis at state level. Track geopolitical logic from inside the regime class.

- **[Project Syndicate](https://www.project-syndicate.org/)**  
Writing from ex-heads of state, Nobel laureates, etc. Often underwhelming, but useful for mainstream consensus checks.

* * *

### 5. **Meta-Trend Trackers / Structured Surface Scanning**

- **[Exponential View](https://www.exponentialview.co/)**  
Azeem Azhar's tech/policy lens. Useful for scanning techno-political direction.

- **[Import AI](https://jack-clark.net/)**  
Jack Clark's (Anthropic) newsletter. Captures AI developments with policy + power lens.
- **[Not Boring](https://www.notboring.co/)**  
Mixed strategic/optimistic takes on business models. Increasingly formulaic but still sharp.

* * *

### Tactical Summary:

| **Use-Case** | **Top Picks** | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Source-proximate tech news | Hacker News, Lobsters, Reddit curated feeds | 
| Early AI signals | arXiv Sanity, Import AI, Papers with Code | 
| Deep strategic commentary | Stratechery, Money Stuff, Paul Graham, Ben Delo's writings | 
| Foundational reasoning | LessWrong, Distill, Every.to | 
| Macro / elite narrative | Foreign Affairs, Noema, Project Syndicate, Exponential View |

Would you prefer feeds optimized for daily surface-scanning, or deeper longform sources for slow thinking? I can filter or synthesize a flow system based on your use rhythms.
