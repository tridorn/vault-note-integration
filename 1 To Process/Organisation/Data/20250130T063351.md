# CRAPM Review Logging Form Design

To streamline your review process within the CRAPM method and ensure it's platform-independent while also allowing for historical data analysis without extensive prose logging, using a tool like Google Forms can be efficient and effective. Here's how you can design a quick logging mechanism through a form, focusing on capturing the most valuable and impactful data for analysis:

## Designing Your Google Form for CRAPM Review

Your form should consist of concise questions that can be answered via multiple choice, checkboxes, or short text fields. This allows for rapid input while maintaining the flexibility to review the data for insights over time.

### 1. Task Completion

- **Question:** How many tasks did I complete?
- **Format:** Multiple choice (e.g., "1-2", "3-5", "6+")

### 2. Priority Tasks

- **Question:** Did I complete my priority task(s)?
- **Format:** Multiple choice (e.g., "Yes, all", "Some", "None")

### 3. Distractions

- **Question:** Was I distracted?
- **Format:** Multiple choice (e.g., "Not at all", "A little", "Frequently", "Constantly")

### 4. Nature of Distractions

- **Question (Optional):** What distracted me? (Only appears if "A little", "Frequently", or "Constantly" is selected for the previous question)
- **Format:** Checkboxes (e.g., "Email", "Social Media", "Colleagues/Family", "Other")

### 5. Satisfaction

- **Question:** How satisfied am I with my progress?
- **Format:** Scale of 1-5

### 6. Energy Level

- **Question:** What was my energy level like?
- **Format:** Scale of 1-5

### 7. Adjustments Needed

- **Question:** Do I need to adjust my plan for the next segment?
- **Format:** Multiple choice (e.g., "Yes, significantly", "Yes, slightly", "No")

### 8. Insights for Improvement

- **Question:** What one thing could I do better in the next segment?
- **Format:** Short answer (Optional)

## Implementation Tips

- **Keep It Short:** Ensure the form can be completed quickly to maintain the efficiency of your CRAPM routine.
- **Review Regularly:** Set aside a time weekly or monthly to review your responses and identify patterns or areas for improvement.
- **Iterate:** Based on your reviews, adjust the form questions as needed to better capture useful data.

Using Google Forms in this way allows you to quickly log essential data points that provide insights into your productivity habits, distractions, and overall satisfaction. Over time, you'll accumulate a valuable dataset for analyzing trends and identifying areas for improvement, all while keeping the process streamlined and manageable, even if you're only using your mind or minimal tools to guide your day.
