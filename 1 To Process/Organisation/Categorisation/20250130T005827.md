The project is to create a certain medium, the goal is for example to create a website.

But you don't develop a website, instead you focus on creating an abstracted version (in part through the master content, in other parts through for example standardised folder structures), which can be specialised (adopted into any medium), from the website to marketing materials, audios, videos.
