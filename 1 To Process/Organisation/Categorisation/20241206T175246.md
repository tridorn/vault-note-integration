The structure you've established for **Areas** under the PARA system and your email folder system are both well thought-out, but they follow slightly different organizational logics. To unify them, we should create a single structure that reflects the **Areas** framework while leveraging the elegant distinctions in your email system. Here's how I propose combining them:

---

### Unified Folder Structure for Both PARA and Email

   - **Current Role**

### Notes for Implementation

1. **Folder Mirroring Across Systems**: Use the same primary folder names across both your PARA system and email, ensuring continuity. Subfolders should map directly, such as:
   - **Work > Projects > Ongoing** in PARA matching **Work > Current Projects** in email.
   - **Finances > Taxes > Correspondence** in PARA matching **Finance > Taxes** in email.

2. **Automation in Email**: Leverage rules to auto-categorize emails into their respective PARA folders (e.g., Finance > Investments, Health > Medical).

3. **Archives**: Implement yearly subfolders (2024, 2023, etc.) under each main category for emails and PARA folders that are no longer active.

4. **Action Folders**:
   - Create universal **Action Items** folders, subdivided into **To Do**, **Follow Up**, and **Reference**, as these apply to both email and PARA usage.

This unified structure maintains logical continuity while introducing more streamlined management across PARA and email systems. Adjust specific subfolders as your workflow evolves!
