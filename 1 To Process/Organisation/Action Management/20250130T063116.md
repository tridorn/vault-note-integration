Here‚Äôs a **complete system** for structuring **smart lists** around **primary contexts** while integrating prioritization, scheduling, and flagging. This approach organizes tasks to **focus discovery** on what to do within contexts while still offering **standalone overviews** for broader planning or review. The system is grouped into **broad categories** to balance focus and flexibility.

---

## **System Overview**

### **1. Primary Context-Based Smart Lists (Discovery-Focused)**

Smart lists built around **contexts**, incorporating combinations of scheduling, prioritization, and flagging to help you decide what to work on **within each context**.

### **2. Standalone Smart Lists (Overviews)**

Smart lists that provide a bird‚Äôs-eye view of tasks across contexts, helping you review and organize your day, week, or flagged items.

### **3. Specialized Smart Lists (Hybrid and Miscellaneous)**

Hybrid lists that blend context and standalone factors for unique workflows or niche needs.

---

### **Weekly Review (Planning and Organizing)**

1. **Check Overviews**:
	- `‚è∞ Overdue`: Resolve lingering tasks.
	- `üìÜ This Week`: Plan for the week ahead.

2. **Organize Contexts**:
