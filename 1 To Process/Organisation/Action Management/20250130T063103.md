Yes, those **contextual smart lists** will serve as the **main way of discovering what to do** because they dynamically filter and organize tasks based on the most relevant factors for decision-making. Here's why they are effective and how they fit into your workflow:

---

### **Why Contextual Smart Lists Are Central**

1. **Dynamic Discovery**:
	- Instead of browsing through long, static task lists, smart lists provide **real-time, curated views** of tasks based on what’s actionable given your current context (e.g., location, energy, time).
	- This reduces the decision fatigue of figuring out “What should I do next?”

2. **Tailored to Current Situations**:
	- The lists adapt to your **current priorities, availability, and energy levels**.
	- For example:
	  - Use `@Focus + High Priority` during peak focus hours.
	  - Switch to `@Quick Wins + Today` during low-energy moments or short breaks.

3. **Flexible but Clear**:
	- Smart lists integrate **prioritization**, **scheduling**, and **flagging**, ensuring you’re always looking at the **most critical or relevant tasks** first.
	- You can quickly pivot between lists depending on what your day demands.

### **How Contextual Lists Guide Action**

#### **1. Priority-Driven Workflow**

	- **Key Lists**:
	  - `🔥 High Priority`
	  - `📅 Today - All`
	- **Usage**:
	  - Start your day here to see the most critical tasks.
	  - Focus first on tasks in `🔥 High Priority`, ensuring maximum impact.

#### **2. Context-Specific Decision-Making**

	- **Key Lists**:
	  - `🧠🔥 Focus + High Priority`: For deep work.
	  - `⚡📅 Quick Wins + Today`: For low-energy periods or short time blocks.
	  - `🤝📅 Collaborate + Today`: For tasks requiring interaction with others.
	- **Usage**:
	  - Pick the smart list that matches your current situation or location.
	  - For example, if you have a team meeting soon, work from `🤝📅 Collaborate + Today` to prepare.

#### **3. Adaptive Workflow for Interruptions**

	- **Key Lists**:
	  - `🏁 Flagged - All`: For flagged, urgent tasks.
	  - `🌍🏁 On The Go + Flagged`: For tasks while commuting or waiting.
	- **Usage**:
	  - If priorities shift mid-day, flagged lists help you quickly adapt.
	  - Use mobile-friendly contexts like `🌍🏁 On The Go` to stay productive while away from your desk.

#### **4. Weekly Planning and Overdue Tasks**

	- **Key Lists**:
	  - `📆 This Week`
	  - `⏰ Overdue`
	- **Usage**:
	  - During your weekly review, use `📆 This Week` to plan your schedule.
	  - Resolve overdue tasks from `⏰ Overdue` to stay on track.

### **Advantages Of Contextual Smart Lists for Discovery**

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
	- You don’t need to think about “what’s next.” Each list provides **pre-filtered tasks** based on your current needs.

2. **Improved Focus**:
	- Contextual filtering ensures you only see tasks relevant to your current location, tools, or mindset.

3. **Adaptability**:
	- Easily switch between lists as your priorities or circumstances change during the day.

4. **Holistic Planning**:
	- Lists like `📅 Today - All` or `📆 This Week` provide a higher-level view of all tasks, while specific contexts like `🧠🔥 Focus` guide granular action.

Your contextual lists are the **actionable interface** for your GTD system. They allow you to:

1. **Discover** what to do based on priorities, deadlines, and current context.
2. **Focus** on the most relevant tasks without distractions.
3. **Adapt** quickly to changes in circumstances.

By centralizing decision-making around these smart lists, you’ll gain clarity, productivity, and peace of mind. Let me know if you’d like help setting this up directly in Apple Reminders!
