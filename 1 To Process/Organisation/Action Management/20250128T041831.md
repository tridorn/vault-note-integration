The relationship between *designing* and the *Plan → Execute → Review* core loop depends on the project's nature and complexity. While it logically follows planning, **designing is not always embedded within the core loop** of *Plan → Execute → Review*. Instead, it can be an independent stage or integrated iteratively based on the type of project. Let’s dissect this further:

---

### **When Designing is Independent**

In some projects, the **design phase is a one-time prelude** to execution:
- **Examples**: 
  - Building construction (architectural blueprints come before laying bricks).
  - Software architecture (system design before coding).
- **Process**:
  - Designing happens after planning and before the iterative execution begins.
  - This approach is suitable when **foundational designs** must be finalised upfront for everything else to proceed smoothly.
  - **Visual Flow**:  
	 - **Planning → Designing → [Plan → Execute → Review]**

---

### **When Designing is Part of the Core Loop**

For agile, flexible, or exploratory projects, **designing is embedded within each iterative cycle**:
- **Examples**: 
  - Software sprints (UX/UI evolves with feedback).
  - Product development (prototypes are revised during execution).
- **Process**:
  - Designing occurs iteratively alongside execution and is continuously revisited during reviews.
  - **Visual Flow**:
	 - **[Design → Execute → Review → Plan (next iteration)]**

This is often the case in projects with:
1. **High uncertainty**: You’re experimenting or testing concepts as part of the design.
2. **Feedback loops**: Stakeholders or users influence the design mid-project.

---

### **Practical Criteria: Independent vs. Integrated Designing**

#### **1. Is the Design Foundational or evolving?**

	- Foundational (e.g., system architecture): Independent phase.
	- Evolving (e.g., iterative UI): Part of the core loop.

#### **2. How Rigid is the project’s structure?**

	- Rigid (e.g., engineering specs): Independent.
	- Flexible (e.g., experimental projects): Integrated.

#### **3. Are Prototypes deliverables?**

	- Deliverables (e.g., MVPs): Design is part of the loop.
	- Non-deliverables (e.g., finalizing blueprints): Design is separate.

---

### **Design In Practice for Both Scenarios**

#### **If Independent**

1. **Break It Down**:
	- Divide design work into milestones (e.g., concept → prototype → final design).
2. **Feedback Integration**:
	- Create checkpoints to verify alignment with project goals.
3. **Handover to Execution**:
	- Treat the final design as the starting point for execution.

#### **If Integrated**

1. **Small Iterations**:
	- Design small chunks (e.g., one feature or component) per sprint.
2. **Stakeholder Collaboration**:
	- Regularly review evolving designs to ensure alignment.
3. **Flexible Planning**:
	- Allow room for revising designs within each iteration.

---

### **Blended Approach**

Many projects require a combination of both:
- **Example**:
  - Foundational designs (e.g., system architecture) are completed upfront.
  - Component-level designs (e.g., feature details) evolve within the iterative loop.

**Flow**:  
**Planning → Foundational Design → [Iterative Designing → Execute → Review → Plan]**

---

### **Key Takeaway**

Designing isn’t always part of the *Plan → Execute → Review* loop. It can be:
1. **Independent**: Foundational and finalized early.
2. **Integrated**: Evolving and iterative, adjusted as the project progresses.
3. **Blended**: Initial high-level designs, followed by iterative detailing during execution.

Would you like me to provide a domain-specific example or visual representation of these scenarios?
