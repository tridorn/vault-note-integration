Handling project movement between stages‚Äîespecially when **planning, execution, and review** form an iterative loop‚Äîrequires a balance of structure and flexibility. Here‚Äôs a practical guide to managing this flow effectively, while keeping your Kanban system and GTD practices aligned:

---

### **1. Define Clear Criteria for Moving Between Stages**

To prevent uncertainty, establish clear conditions that signal when a project should move from one stage to another.

#### **a. Moving from Ideation to Planning**

- **Criteria**:
  - The project has a clear goal or desired outcome.
  - Initial research or brainstorming is sufficient to start structuring tasks.
  - Key stakeholders (if any) are aligned with the project‚Äôs purpose.
- **Actions**:
  - Create a high-level outline or roadmap.
  - Identify key milestones and dependencies.
  - Prioritize the project in your Kanban system.

---

#### **b. Moving from Planning to Execution**

- **Criteria**:
  - You‚Äôve broken the project into actionable steps (at least the first milestone is clear).
  - Dependencies for starting work have been resolved (e.g., resources are available, approval has been given).
  - The project is ready to be actively worked on without bottlenecks.
- **Actions**:
  - Log the **first actionable tasks** into your system (avoid overloading with every step).
  - Assign a context, priority, or due date to ensure the tasks fit into your workflow.
  - Update the Kanban card to "Execution."

---

#### **c. Moving from Execution to Review**

- **Criteria**:
  - A milestone, deliverable, or major phase of the project is complete.
  - Issues or blockers arise that need analysis before continuing.
  - Feedback is required (from yourself or stakeholders).
- **Actions**:
  - Conduct a review session (formal or informal).
  - Evaluate what went well, what needs improvement, and next steps.
  - Document insights and adjust the project plan accordingly.

---

#### **d. Iterating Back to Planning**

- **Criteria**:
  - The review session identifies gaps, additional steps, or unresolved dependencies.
  - A new phase or milestone needs to be planned.
- **Actions**:
  - Update the roadmap or task list with new insights.
  - Identify dependencies or blockers that need resolution before resuming execution.

---

#### **e. Moving to Delivery or Closure**

- **Criteria**:
  - The primary goal or deliverable is complete.
  - Maintenance or long-term follow-ups are not required, or they are moved to separate projects.
- **Actions**:
  - Archive the project card or move it to a "Closed" column.
  - Celebrate the win or document lessons learned for future reference.

---

### **2. Plan, Execute, Review: Iterative Loop**

Recognize that **planning, execution, and review** are iterative. Here‚Äôs how to manage this loop:

#### **a. Planning Phase**

- **Goal**: Ensure the next iteration of execution is clear and actionable.
- **Actions**:
  - Review feedback and progress from the last iteration.
  - Define the next milestone or deliverable.
  - Break down actionable steps and log them in your task system.
  - Resolve dependencies for the next phase.

#### **b. Execution Phase**

- **Goal**: Complete the planned tasks or milestones.
- **Actions**:
  - Focus on logged tasks in your contexts (e.g., `üõ°Ô∏è Focus`, `‚öîÔ∏è Quick Wins`).
  - Regularly check progress on milestones or deliverables.
  - Flag blockers for resolution during the next review.

#### **c. Review Phase**

- **Goal**: Reflect, adjust, and improve.
- **Actions**:
  - Evaluate what‚Äôs complete and what remains.
  - Identify blockers, gaps, or new insights.
  - Document lessons learned and refine the project plan.

### **3. Practical Steps for Moving Projects**

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step approach to moving projects between stages:

#### **a. Weekly Project Review**

1. **Review Kanban Board**:
	- Move projects based on progress (e.g., from `Planning` to `Execution`).
2. **Check Dependencies**:
	- Ensure all prerequisites for starting work are resolved.
3. **Assign Focus**:
	- Highlight active projects for the coming week (limit to 3‚Äì5).

#### **b. Daily Check-Ins**

1. **Focus on Active Projects**:
	- Ensure at least one actionable task is logged for each project in execution.
2. **Track Milestones**:
	- Use your Kanban system to update progress as milestones are completed.

#### **c. After Milestones or Deliverables**

1. **Conduct a Review**:
	- Reflect on what went well and what needs improvement.
2. **Refine Plans**:
	- Add or adjust tasks for the next iteration.
3. **Decide Next Steps**:
	- Move the project back to `Planning` (for new milestones) or to `Delivery/Closure` (if complete).

### **4. Examples of Movement Between Stages**

#### **Example 1: Writing a Blog Post**

1. **Ideation**:
	- Brainstorm blog topics (`Notes: "Productivity tips, Minimalism, Stoicism"`).
	- Move to `Planning` once the topic is selected.
2. **Planning**:
	- Task: "Create outline for blog post."
	- Task: "Research supporting data."
	- Move to `Execution` once the outline is done.
3. **Execution**:
	- Task: "Write draft."
	- Task: "Edit draft for readability."
	- Move to `Review` once the draft is ready.
4. **Review**:
	- Task: "Get feedback from colleague."
	- Task: "Incorporate edits."
	- Move back to `Execution` (if edits are substantial) or to `Delivery` (if ready to publish).

---

#### **Example 2: Organizing a Team Workshop**

1. **Ideation**:
	- Brainstorm potential topics and formats.
	- Move to `Planning` once the workshop concept is clear.
2. **Planning**:
	- Task: "Finalize workshop agenda."
	- Task: "Book venue and send invites."
	- Move to `Execution` once logistics are handled.
3. **Execution**:
	- Task: "Prepare materials and slides."
	- Task: "Conduct workshop."
	- Move to `Review` post-workshop.
4. **Review**:
	- Task: "Collect feedback from attendees."
	- Task: "Write report on outcomes."
	- Move to `Closure` once feedback is processed.

### **5. Tips for Managing Iterative Projects**

1. **Limit Active Projects**:
	- Focus on 3‚Äì5 projects in the `Execution` stage at any time to avoid overwhelm.

2. **Document Notes and Insights**:
	- Use project cards or notes to capture ideas, feedback, and dependencies for smoother transitions.

3. **Automate Movement Criteria (Optional)**:
	- Use triggers in tools like Notion, Trello, or ClickUp to auto-move projects when milestones are checked off.

4. **Set a Review Cadence**:
	- Regular reviews (e.g., weekly for progress, monthly for broader planning) ensure projects move smoothly through stages.

---

### **Summary**

- **Move Projects Based on Clear Criteria**:
  - Focus on actionable steps and resolved dependencies to guide transitions.
- **Use the Plan-Execute-Review Loop**:
  - Treat planning, execution, and review as iterative, refining the project at each cycle.
- **Focus Your Efforts**:
  - Keep the number of active projects manageable, and log tasks only when needed for the current stage.

This approach keeps your projects flowing effectively while minimizing complexity. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments or examples!
