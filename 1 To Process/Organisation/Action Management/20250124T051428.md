# Flow of Information between Timeframes

### **1. Information Flow Between Timeframes**

The system operates in a **top-down and bottom-up cycle**, ensuring objectives at all levels are aligned while insights and adjustments propagate effectively.

#### **Top-Down Flow**

- **Objective Alignment**: Higher timeframes (e.g., yearly, quarterly) define strategic goals, which cascade into tactical goals for medium timeframes (e.g., monthly, weekly) and actionable goals for short timeframes (e.g., daily, half-hour).
- **Guidance**: The purpose, goals, and key questions from higher timeframes provide context and focus for the lower timeframes.
- **Constraint Setting**: Longer timeframes set constraints such as deadlines, priorities, or resources that inform planning at lower levels.

#### **Bottom-Up Flow**

- **Execution Feedback**: Progress, insights, and challenges encountered in shorter timeframes (e.g., daily) feed into the refinement of medium (e.g., weekly) and long-term timeframes (e.g., quarterly).
- **Emergent Adjustments**: As priorities shift or new challenges emerge, they are escalated upwards, prompting adjustments in focus for higher timeframes.
- **Realignment**: Unmet goals or unresolved key questions at lower timeframes either roll forward to the next timeframe or trigger adjustments at a higher level.

### **2. Refinement and Continuous Improvement Across Timeframes**

To ensure continuous improvement, each timeframe must interact dynamically with the others through structured **review and reflection**, **refinement**, and **iteration cycles**.

#### **Key Components of Refinement**

1. **Review Process**

	 - At the end of each timeframe, evaluate progress against the objectives using the Review and Reflection section:
		  - Were all objectives met?
		  - What challenges or blockers were encountered?
		  - What worked well?
		  - What insights were gained?
2. **Feedback Integration**

	 - Integrate feedback from lower levels into medium and higher timeframes.
	 - Use this feedback to:
		  - Update objectives (if necessary).
		  - Reprioritize milestones or goals.
		  - Revise key questions to focus on emerging challenges.
3. **Iterative Adjustment**

	 - Adjust objectives dynamically in response to:
		  - New priorities.
		  - External changes (e.g., deadlines or stakeholder feedback).
		  - Insights from
