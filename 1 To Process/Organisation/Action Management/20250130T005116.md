# Using Data Gathered in Review for Planning

## Exposition

### Version 1

The data you gather in your review sessions can provide valuable insights into how you work best and thus help you optimize your planning. You're looking to integrate and extend the concept of context, time available, energy available, and priority, which are central tenets of the GTD methodology. Here's how you can do that:

**Context:** This is primarily dictated by your location, resources available, and any other factors that could impact what tasks you can undertake. The data from your review sessions can help you understand which contexts are most conducive to your productivity. For example, if you find that you're consistently more productive when working in a quiet environment, you might decide to schedule more tasks requiring deep focus during times when you have access to such a setting.

**Time Available:** Your review data will give you a clearer picture of how long different types of tasks actually take you, as opposed to how long you think they might take. This can help you plan more accurately. You may find patterns, such as consistently underestimating time for certain types of tasks. You can adjust your future planning based on these insights.

**Energy Available:** Your review data should provide you with a good idea of your natural energy fluctuations throughout the day. You can use this to plan tasks that require high energy during your peak times and less demanding tasks during your energy dips. It's about aligning your task schedule with your natural rhythm for maximum productivity.

**Priority:** Your review sessions should help you see which tasks you consistently prioritize and perhaps whether you tend to neglect certain types of tasks. This insight can help you readjust your task priorities if needed. 

Extending these concepts in light of your gathered data might look like this:

- For each half-hour session, consider the context you'll be in, the time you have available, and your likely energy level (based on past data). 
- Use this to choose tasks from your next actions list that best match these parameters. Remember to consider the priority of the tasks as well, ensuring that high-priority items aren't being neglected.
- As you gain more data and insights, adjust your task selection process as needed. This might mean redefining what certain contexts look like for you, getting more realistic about time estimates, learning to leverage your natural energy rhythms more effectively, and being more strategic about how you prioritize tasks.

By regularly reviewing your data and adjusting your planning process accordingly, you'll be creating a system that's truly tailored to your personal working style and needs. This should lead to improved productivity and greater satisfaction in your work.

### Version 2

When using the data you've gathered in your review session, it can help to inform the planning of your next session in a few ways. Here's how you could directly apply the data:

1. **Assessing Energy Levels**: If you're finding your energy levels consistently low after certain types of tasks, it might be worth planning a less intense task or a short break following these tasks in the future.

2. **Task Completion and Productivity**: If you consistently fail to complete certain tasks within the allotted time, it might indicate that you're underestimating the time required for these tasks, and need to adjust your future planning accordingly. Similarly, if your productivity level drops during a particular period, consider scheduling less demanding tasks during that time.

3. **Distractions**: If you notice that distractions frequently occur during certain parts of your day or while doing specific tasks, it might be worth trying to find strategies to mitigate these distractions in your next sessions.

4. **Difficulty and Task Type**: Pay attention to how the difficulty level and type of task impacts your productivity and energy. Maybe you need more challenging tasks to keep engaged or perhaps certain types of tasks drain your energy. Use this information to better balance your task types and difficulty in your next planning.

5. **Emotional State**: Your mood can influence your productivity. If you're consistently feeling negative emotions during certain tasks or times, it might be worth exploring why and seeing if there are ways to improve your emotional state during those periods.

Remember, the goal is to learn from each session and use those learnings to improve your future sessions. By taking a few moments to review and apply this data during your planning phase, you can adjust your approach to work in ways that better suit your personal rhythms and work style.
