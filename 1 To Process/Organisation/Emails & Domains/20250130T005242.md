For recurring subscriptions, such as an app subscription or iCloud, it's important to differentiate them from typical one-time shopping purchases or traditional utility bills. Since these subscriptions often involve digital services or online tools, here's how you can organize them:

### Creating a Subscriptions Folder

Given their recurring nature and differing context from physical purchases or utility services, subscriptions are best handled in a dedicated folder. This not only helps you track ongoing costs but also makes it easy to review these expenses separately from other types of transactions.

**Folder Name: "Subscriptions"**

#### Subfolder Structure Within Subscriptions

1. **Digital Services**
	- **Examples**: iCloud, Microsoft Office 365, Adobe Creative Cloud
	- **Purpose**: For any cloud-based services or software subscriptions.

2. **Apps**
	- **Examples**: App subscriptions on platforms like Google Play or Apple App Store.
	- **Purpose**: Specifically for mobile or desktop app-related subscriptions.

3. **Media**
	- **Examples**: Netflix, Spotify, online news or magazine subscriptions.
	- **Purpose**: For entertainment and media-related subscriptions.

4. **Miscellaneous**
	- **Examples**: Other recurring services that don't fit neatly into the above categories, like fitness apps or educational platforms.
	- **Purpose**: To keep track of miscellaneous digital services.

### Management Tips for Subscriptions Folder

- **Regular Review**: Periodically check this folder to see if there are subscriptions you no longer use or need, which can help manage costs and eliminate unnecessary expenses.
- **Budgeting**: Use this folder to quickly review monthly or annual expenses related to subscriptions, aiding in financial planning and budget adjustments.
- **Renewal Notices**: Keep an eye on renewal notices that often come via email. Moving them into this folder ensures you don't miss any important updates about price changes or terms.

### Example Workflow

1. **Receiving Subscription Email**: When you receive an email related to your iCloud subscription:
	- **Initial Folder**: Inbox.
	- **Action**: Move to Subscriptions > Digital Services.

2. **Subscription Update or Renewal**: If an email comes in about a change in terms or pricing:
	- **Initial Folder**: Inbox.
	- **Action**: Review the changes, then move it to the appropriate subfolder within Subscriptions.

This approach not only keeps your primary categories like "Shopping" and "Utilities" clear and focused on their specific purposes but also gives you a dedicated space to manage and review ongoing digital subscriptions. This organizational strategy is particularly useful in managing digital expenses effectively and ensures you maintain control over your recurring digital commitments.
