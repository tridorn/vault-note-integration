### Your North-Star Objective  
**Convert ProCredit’s curiosity into a signed, time-boxed pilot while simultaneously “institutionalizing” Veridian (legal entity, advisors, pre-seed capital) so you can court two-to-three additional banks in parallel.**  
That dual track (pilot + credibility build-up) gives you speed **and** leverage.

---

## 1. Keep ProCredit Hot — 48-Hour Action

| Step | What you send | Why it matters |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **1.1** | **“Thank-you & recap” email** (bullet summary of call, their pain points you heard, and your understanding of next steps). | Signals professionalism; prevents drift. |
| **1.2** | Attach a **2-page Pilot Blueprint**: scope, success metrics, timeline (≤ 12 weeks), minimal IT contact points. | Shows you’re ready to execute, not theorize. |
| **1.3** | Attach a **Data-Request Annex** (5–6 bullet questions). | Gives them homework and forces internal discussion. |
| **1.4** | Propose **three concrete time slots** for the next call with the returning colleague. | Removes scheduling friction. |

> *Tone: decisive, concise, partnership-oriented. Three paragraphs max.*

## 2. Design the Pilot so It’s Irresistible

**Pillars**

1. **Tight wedge**: one upgrade (rooftop solar), one region, 20–30 SMEs, 3 vendor partners.  
2. **Bank lift**: promise ≥ 40 % underwriting-time reduction.  
3. **Simple legal**: 6-page MoU, soft exclusivity (e.g., 90-day pilot exclusivity only for that region/product).  
4. **Shared marketing win**: draft press-release outline (“ProCredit pilots first digital green-loan fast-track for SMEs”).  
5. **Clear kill-switch**: if KPIs aren’t met, either side can stop—reduces risk for them.

Prepare a **one-slide ROI table** (hours saved, loans financed, CO₂ avoided) so internal sponsors can sell it upstairs.

## 3. Institutionalize Veridian in 30 Days

| Domain | Minimum viable move | Rationale |
|--------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Legal** | Form **Delaware C-Corp** (top) + German UG/GmbH (sub) **now**, before signing MoU. | U.S. structure keeps global VC doors open; German sub handles payroll and grants. |
| **Governance** | 2–3 seasoned **advisors** (ex-bank green-finance lead, fintech CTO, climate policy lawyer). Sign advisory equity (0.25–0.5 % each). | Signals “institution-grade” maturity to banks & VCs. |
| **Capital** | Target **€500-750 k pre-seed SAFE**: mix of Germany climate angels, Planet A / Extantia, and one small U.S. climate micro-fund. | Gives 12-month runway to fund pilot(s), first hires, and security audits. |
| **Team** | Hire **fractional CTO** (20 h/week) + **credit-risk PM** contractor. | Covers security/compliance questions in bank DD. |

## 4. Parallel Bank Pipeline (Create Competitive Heat)

1. **Short-list 3 peer banks** in adjacent markets (e.g., Raiffeisen Bulgaria, OTP Serbia, Banca Transilvania).  
2. **Intro channel**: warm intros via startup hubs, EBRD, green-tech VC partners.  
3. **Timing**: outreach **after** you email ProCredit the Pilot Blueprint (so you’re not waiting idly during their vacation gap).  
4. **Talk track**: “We’re piloting with a leading Balkan bank; capacity for one additional design partner in Q3.”  
5. **Avoid hard exclusives**: ProCredit gets right of first refusal to scale inside their own footprint, **not** a regional lock-out.

## 5. Speed Levers (0–90 Days)

| Week | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| **0–2** | Incorporate, advisory board signed, recap email + Pilot Blueprint sent, prototype polished. |
| **2–4** | Pre-seed deck finished, 10 investor targets in CRM, outreach begins. Vendor MoUs drafted. |
| **4–6** | ProCredit pilot MoU negotiated, second bank discovery calls underway. |
| **6–8** | Pilot sandbox live (dummy data), security checklist completed, investor soft-circles closed. |
| **8–12** | Pilot onboarding first SMEs, public press note drafted, tranche-1 funding wired. |

## 6. Answering “Why You” to Investors & Banks

| Pain (Stakeholder) | Your Unique Hook |
|--------------------|------------------|
| **Bank underwriting drag** | 50 % faster with Veridian’s standardized packet & Taxonomy pre-check. |
| **Vendor CAC** | Finance-ready leads; pay only on success. |
| **SME confusion** | One wizard, instant ROI, vendor + financing bundle. |
| **Regulatory fear** | Pre-built EBA green-loan label logic and audit trail. |
| **Investor upside** | Embedded-lending revenue share + future securitization/carbon layers (see long-term thesis). |

---

## 7. Communications Discipline (Avoid “yapping”)

- **Framework answers**: For every Q, respond in **three beats**:  
  1. *Reference problem* (1 sentence)  
  2. *State how Veridian solves it* (1 sentence)  
  3. *Offer evidence or next step* (1 sentence)  
- **Deflect rabbit-holes**: “Great point—let me send a one-pager on that after the call so we stay on schedule.”

---

## 8. Fundraising Message (Very Short)

> *“Veridian is Stripe × Plaid for green SME finance in Eastern Europe.  
>  First bank pilot signed, €X pipeline, clear path to €500M GMV in 24 months.  
>  Raising €600 k pre-seed SAFE to fund the pilot pipeline and security compliance.”*

### **Execute this dual-track plan and you’ll keep ProCredit warm, create optionality with other banks, and present yourself to VCs as an already-moving, institution-grade play—not a student side-project.**
