Let's think of a hypothetical nation in an isekai-like scenario. I get reincarnated as the firstborn son of the emperor of a smaller nation. I think that a smaller nation can grow outsized importance if it has some few major businesses, and get these businesses major by granting them extraordinary privileges. Given some special circumstances in the nation, power might for example not be completely centralised in the crown, landowners or others might have larger influence, as well as other considerations, make the businesses part of the personal domain, part of the state (I don't want it to be a venture of a few major aristocrats as in the example of the British East India Company which serves as the base here), etc., please sketch such a scenario
