# Directive of 2025-04-19

---

## Pre-Execution

### Intention
<!-- What broader chief aim do you want to focus on today? -->
- Do first implementation of learn & build

### Objectives
<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- Completely process The Consulting Bible by Alan Weiss
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- Do first iteration of timeframes up to year
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
- Go to sleep orderly

### Process
<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1: First skim book, then process chapter-by-chapter
- Task 2: Do first 
- Task 3: Do correct wind-down. Be home at 21:00. Do evening routine

### Friction Mitigation
<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->
- Listening to music
- Don't actually implement timeframe planning
- Don't follow build & learn

## Execution

### Friction
<!-- What slowed execution today? E.g., distractions, over-perfection, slow decision-making, unexpected blockers. -->
- 

### Adjustments
<!-- What tweaks were made mid-day to maintain efficiency? Only note direct changes to process. -->
-

## Post-Execution

### Objectives Deviation
<!-- Did execution match expectation? If not, what caused deviation? -->
- [ ] Task 1:
- [ ] Task 2:  
- [ ] Task 3:  

### Optimisation
<!-- What execution inefficiency should be addressed tomorrow? Focus on a single high-leverage improvement. -->
- 

### Process Experiment
<!-- What **one small tweak** will be tested tomorrow to refine execution? Keep it experimental and specific. -->
