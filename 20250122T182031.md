**Optimize WhatsApp for Team Collaboration**:

- **Create Dedicated Groups**: Organize separate WhatsApp groups for different projects, departments, or purposes (e.g., announcements, brainstorming, social activities). This reduces clutter and ensures important messages aren't lost.
- **Utilize WhatsApp Features**: Use features like pinned messages to highlight important information, and group descriptions to outline the group's purpose and guidelines.
- **Establish Communication Protocols**: Set simple rules, such as prefixing tasks with "Action Required" or using hashtags for easy searchability (e.g., #deadline, #meeting).
