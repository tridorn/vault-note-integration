# Reward of stoicism

Your inquiry could be better articulated as: "Given that Stoicism asks us to reject external validation, not pursue wealth, and remain subdued, it feels counterintuitive to what society values. What is the true point or reward of staying true to Stoic teachings? Is there even a reward, or is the concept of a reward itself at odds with Stoicism?"

The tension you feel is entirely understandable. Modern values, driven by consumerism and societal validation, tend to promote the idea that **happiness and success** come from **external achievements**—wealth, recognition, and the pursuit of pleasure. Stoicism, on the other hand, seems to turn this upside down, suggesting that true fulfillment is found in **self-mastery, virtue, and emotional equanimity**, which often doesn’t appear immediately rewarding in the conventional sense.

This conflict can lead to existential questioning about the purpose of following Stoic principles if the immediate, tangible "rewards" that society promises—wealth, validation, status—are seen as either indifferent or unimportant. Let’s delve deeper into this to understand whether there is a **reward** in Stoicism, and if so, what that reward really is.

---

### **1. The Reward is Inner Peace (Ataraxia)**

The primary "reward" that Stoicism offers is a state of **inner peace** or **ataraxia**, which refers to freedom from disturbance or turmoil. Unlike conventional rewards—such as wealth, recognition, or pleasure—this reward is **internal** and rooted in a sense of **self-mastery** and **emotional equilibrium**. For the Stoic, this is the highest form of contentment because it is **independent of external circumstances**.

#### **What This Means**:
- **Ataraxia** is a state where you are not constantly swayed by the **whims of fate**, external opinions, or material desires. It is a deep, enduring form of happiness that arises from being in control of your own mind and emotions. You no longer depend on external success or validation to feel at peace.
  
- This internal stability is the result of practicing virtue, which aligns your actions with reason and your deeper nature. The Stoic reward is not one that you can measure in terms of **tangible results** but in terms of your capacity to remain **unshaken** by life’s inevitable ups and downs.

#### **Practical Thought**:
While society often teaches that happiness comes from external achievements, Stoicism challenges this by suggesting that true freedom comes from **emotional resilience** and **self-governance**. If you are no longer emotionally dependent on wealth, validation, or status, you gain a profound sense of **independence and freedom**.

**Example**: Imagine facing a career setback, such as a demotion or being overlooked for a promotion. In a conventional mindset, this could cause stress or feelings of failure. A Stoic, however, would approach it with equanimity, recognizing that **external success does not define their inner state**. By practicing Stoic principles, you maintain your **calm**, even when external recognition is absent.

### **2. The Reward is Autonomy Over Your Life**

Another way to frame the reward in Stoicism is through **autonomy**—the ability to control your own reactions and decisions, rather than being controlled by external forces. The pursuit of **wealth** or **validation** often makes individuals dependent on the opinions of others or on circumstances they can’t control, leading to a life filled with anxiety, stress, and disappointment when those things aren’t achieved.

#### **What This Means**:
- **Autonomy** in Stoicism is the reward of knowing that you are no longer at the mercy of fortune or external events. When you master your desires, emotions, and attachments, you gain the ability to live according to your own **rational principles** rather than chasing societal expectations.
  
- This is not about **giving up ambition** but about ensuring that your ambition is **directed inward**, toward becoming the best version of yourself—one that is **self-sufficient** and not beholden to the shifting winds of external rewards.

#### **Practical Thought**:
Instead of seeking external validation or wealth as a source of happiness, Stoicism encourages you to shift your focus to cultivating **inner strength**. This autonomy allows you to live according to your values, free from the stress of constantly trying to meet external expectations.

**Example**: If society expects you to be constantly climbing the corporate ladder, Stoicism teaches you to step back and ask, “Is this aligned with my values? Or am I pursuing this because I feel pressured to achieve external success?” The reward is the ability to choose your path based on **virtue**, not on external expectations.

### **3. Virtue as its Own Reward**

For Stoics, **virtue itself is the highest good**, and living virtuously is its own reward. This might sound abstract, but what it means is that when you act in alignment with **wisdom**, **justice**, **courage**, and **temperance**, you are living in accordance with your **highest nature**. The reward here is not external validation but the **inner fulfillment** of knowing you are living rightly.

#### **What This Means**:
- Stoicism teaches that **living according to reason** and virtue is the most **noble goal**. The fulfillment comes not from external recognition but from knowing that you are acting in alignment with your **true self**. This alignment creates a sense of **integrity** and **self-respect** that cannot be taken away, regardless of external circumstances.
  
- Acting virtuously provides a deep sense of **purpose** and **meaning**, which is far more stable and enduring than the fleeting pleasure of wealth or status. You know that whatever happens in life, you have acted in the best way possible, which brings **peace of mind**.

#### **Practical Thought**:
This principle can be challenging to accept, especially in a society that prizes external rewards. However, by reframing your mindset, you begin to see that **acting with integrity**, making ethical decisions, and practicing virtue give a profound and **enduring satisfaction** that external success cannot provide.

**Example**: If you choose to stand up for justice in a situation where it might be easier to stay silent, the reward is not in being praised for your courage but in the deep satisfaction of knowing that you acted with integrity, regardless of the outcome.

### **4. Freedom from Emotional Turmoil (Freedom from the Passions)**

Another Stoic reward is **freedom from the passions**—that is, freedom from being overwhelmed by intense emotions like **anger**, **fear**, **greed**, or **envy**. Stoicism teaches that when you live according to reason, you gain mastery over your emotions, allowing you to approach life’s challenges with **calm and clarity**.

#### **What This Means**:
- Many of the stresses and anxieties of life stem from being overly attached to outcomes, whether it's gaining wealth, achieving status, or receiving validation. The Stoic reward is the ability to remain emotionally balanced and free from the **suffering** that comes from chasing these external goals.
  
- This emotional freedom allows you to remain **unshaken** in the face of adversity, loss, or disappointment. Instead of being consumed by negative emotions, you cultivate a **steady tranquility** that provides an unshakable sense of well-being.

#### **Practical Thought**:
By practicing Stoic principles, you cultivate **emotional resilience**—the ability to respond to life’s difficulties with **reason** rather than being overwhelmed by emotional reactions. This emotional freedom brings a sense of peace that transcends the pursuit of external rewards.

**Example**: Imagine facing a financial loss. Rather than spiraling into anxiety or regret, a Stoic would recognize that wealth is an **indifferent** and focus on what is within their control—how to respond wisely and recover with integrity. This freedom from emotional turmoil is a key Stoic reward.

### **5. The Point of Stoicism is to Cultivate an Unshakable Inner Self**

The ultimate reward in Stoicism is not something that can be quantified in terms of material success or emotional highs. The true reward is the development of an **unshakable inner self**—a character that remains **strong, resilient**, and **virtuous** regardless of external circumstances. This unshakable self provides a deep sense of **purpose**, **clarity**, and **peace**, which is more valuable than any external reward.

#### **What This Means**:
- Stoicism offers a path to becoming a person who is **internally secure**—someone who is not thrown off balance by loss, failure, or even success. This strength of character is the ultimate reward because it allows you to navigate life with **dignity** and **grace**, no matter what happens.
  
- The **point of Stoicism** is to cultivate this inner strength and **self-mastery**, which leads to a profound sense of fulfillment. This is a form of happiness that is not dependent on wealth, status, or external validation, but on the ability to live in accordance with your highest self.

#### **Practical Thought**:
Focus on cultivating an inner self that is **resilient**, **virtuous**, and grounded in reason. The reward lies in knowing that you can handle life’s challenges with grace and that your well-being is not dependent on external circumstances.

**Example**: When faced with criticism, a Stoic would not crumble under the weight of others' opinions. Instead, they would remain steadfast, reflecting on whether the criticism is valid, and if not, dismiss it. The ability to **remain unshaken** by external judgments is one of the most powerful Stoic rewards.

---

### **Conclusion**:

The **reward** of following Stoic teachings is not one of **material gain** or **emotional highs**. Instead, it is a reward of **inner mastery**, **autonomy**, and **freedom** from emotional turmoil. Stoicism provides a path to achieving **inner peace**, **resilience**, and **virtue**, which are far more stable and enduring than the fleeting rewards society often prizes.

While these rewards may seem intangible or less immediately gratifying compared to the pursuit of wealth or validation, they offer a **deeper sense of fulfillment**—one that is rooted in **self-mastery** and **moral integrity**. The point of Stoicism is to cultivate an **unshakable inner self**, one that remains **virtuous** and **at peace** regardless of external circumstances.

In short, the reward in Stoicism is **freedom**—freedom from being controlled by external forces, freedom from emotional turmoil, and the freedom to live in accordance with your highest nature. This form of happiness may not be immediately obvious, but it is the most enduring and profound reward of all.
