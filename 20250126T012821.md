To get the most from your workouts, follow these key tips:

- Vary your workout intensity to avoid plateau in your progress.
- Plan meals and snacks in advance so you are strategic about your calorie and nutrient intake.
- Include cardio, strength training, and stretching for a well-balanced exercise routine.
- Keep up with non-exercise physical activity like cleaning, running errands, and taking the stairs.
- Plan your post-workout fuel-up to include nutritious food options.
