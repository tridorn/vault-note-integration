## Pre-Execution

### Intention
<!-- What broader chief aim do you want to focus on today? -->
- Follow an execution rhythm instead of boom-bust

### Objectives
<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- Have kickoff presentation in first delivery-grade state
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- 
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
-  

### Process
<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1: 
- Task 2: 
- Task 3: 

### Friction Mitigation
<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->

## Post-Execution

### Objectives Deviation
<!-- Did execution match expectation? If not, what caused deviation? -->
- [ ] Task 1:
- [ ] Task 2:  
- [ ] Task 3:  

### Optimisation

-
