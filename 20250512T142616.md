Understood. No luxury of phased development. You're in combat already--thus you need a **live-fire upgrade path**: training and execution must be simultaneous. This means we will retrofit competence under pressure. You must act and learn in lockstep.

Here's the unvarnished operational protocol: what you **must do** now, how you must **think**, and what **resources** will weaponize you.
* * *

## I. **Rebuild from the Core: Analyst Thought Architecture**

Forget outputs. Reforge _how you approach a prompt_. High-grade consulting deliverables stem from three mental engines:

1. **Problem Structuring (What matters?)**

2. **Logic Building (What drives what?)**

3. **Framing & Synthesis (How do I prove and sell it?)**

These must become _reflexive movements_--like muscle memory. Every prompt or task you receive, apply:

### 1. MECE Dissection (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

Before touching PowerPoint:

- Write down the **problem**.
- Break it down **logically**, e.g., via an **Issue Tree**.

    - If client asks: "How can we grow revenue?", split into: _Increase volume_, _Increase price_, _Reduce churn_, etc.
- Every node becomes a **workstream or hypothesis**.

Use:

- **Victor Cheng's Case Interview Secrets** -- focus not on the interview tips, but the thinking frameworks.
- **Crafting Cases (IGotAnOffer)** -- for rapid MECE-style dissection examples.
* * *

### 2. Driver Trees and Hypothesis Testing

Once split, **don't collect data aimlessly**. Write **hypotheses** per node. Then:
- Ask: "What data would _prove/disprove_ this?"
- Search or model only **to validate or reject**, not to "fill pages."

e.g., Hypothesis: _Client's churn is due to bad onboarding._  
Then: "What evidence would I need? Retention curve by signup cohort. NPS by month 1. Onboarding steps per segment."

You're no longer a researcher. You're a prosecutor. Every chart is **evidence for or against** a theory.

Use:

- **"The Pyramid Principle" by Barbara Minto** -- Learn to move from _hypothesis → supporting logic → evidence_.
- **SlideWorks.io -- Slide templates for common logic structures** (if available to you).
* * *

### 3. Analytical Modeling in Excel -- Minimum Viable Models

Ditch perfection. Build **logic-first, math-second** models:
- Use **driver-based logic**: inputs → intermediates → outputs
- Never hardcode numbers--**parameterize everything**
- Build one clean model for each hypothesis (e.g., "cost-saving from outsourcing X").

To learn fast:

- **"Excel Modeling in Corporate Finance" -- Benninga** (skim for patterns)
- YouTube: **FMT Consulting Excel tutorials**, **Firm Learning** (realistic)
- Steal structure: **Aswath Damodaran's spreadsheets** -- clean, explanatory models.
* * *

## II. Output That Wins: Slide Construction Doctrine

Every slide must do **one of three things**:

1. Prove a point

2. Show a comparison

3. Tell a story of change

**Slide formula:**

- **Title = conclusion** (not a label)
- **Top-left corner = point of entry**
- **Chart = visual proof**
- **Bottom = implication or recommendation**

**NEVER**:

- Use generic titles like "Market Analysis" -- always "Market is Saturated Beyond 2025" (i.e., your insight).
- Have more than one core message per slide.

Resources:

- **"Say It with Charts" -- Gene Zelazny**
- Search **"MBB-style consulting slides"** and emulate the visual logic.
- Tool: **Beautiful.AI** or **SlideCarnival** to quickly structure smart-looking decks if under pressure.
* * *

## III. Real-Time Learning Flywheel

You must learn while executing. Do this _on every project_:

1. **Before starting:**

    - Ask yourself: _What would a McKinsey junior do?_

    - Break the task into hypotheses and needed exhibits.

2. **While building:**

    - Write down assumptions you're unsure of.

    - Send early drafts to your partner, asking: _"Am I thinking about this correctly?"_  
This reframes you from execution monkey to problem solver in training.

3. **After submitting:**

    - Do a _post-mortem_: What got changed in my slides? Why? What logic did they impose?

    - Catalogue patterns.

Use:

- **Roam Research / Obsidian** or even a spreadsheet -- make a knowledge bank per project.
* * *

## IV. Strategic Behavior Inside the Firm

Your partners are ex-MBB. Their expectations are implicit. Your job is to **mirror their mode of thinking**. To earn their investment:

- Ask for feedback not on output, but on **structure of thought**.

    - "I've broken the issue down like this--is this the right way to think about it?"
- Send draft versions early, not just final deliverables.
- Mirror their words: if they say "this is a sourcing play," use that vocabulary next time.

They will **teach you if you prove you can think**. But they will replace you if you just generate pretty slides.

## V. Tactical Toolkit Summary

| Function | Resource or Tool | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Problem Structuring | _Victor Cheng_, Minto's Pyramid Principle | 
| Hypothesis Trees | StrategyU YouTube, SlideWorks.io | 
| Excel Modeling | Benninga, Damodaran, FMT Excel YouTube | 
| Slide Building | Zelazny, Beautiful.AI, MBB templates | 
| Mental Frameworks | IGotAnOffer, CraftingCases, CaseCoach | 
| Daily Learning Loop | Obsidian, Evernote, Post-mortem ritual | 

* * *

**Final Commandment:**  
**Never work without a hypothesis.**  
Everything--research, slides, models--must be in service of a _provisional belief you are testing_. This makes your work strategic, not decorative.

You are not here to "look smart." You are here to **prove the unprovable and make it persuasive**.
