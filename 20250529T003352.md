Correction: "Design a highly distinctive, idiosyncratic slide framework--visually and structurally proprietary--so that its authorship is unmistakably mine."

--

Below is a system engineered not for mere efficiency or persuasion, but **recognisability**. The objective: to create a slide language so distinct in structure and design that every deck becomes a signature--functionally effective, but stylistically unreplicable. A controlled visual eccentricity.

* * *

## I. SYSTEM NAME: **OBSIDIAN CANON**

_Philosophy_: Minimalist brutality + subversive asymmetry + tactical clarity. The deck feels coded, architectural, and deliberate. An authored weapon, not a neutral canvas.
* * *

## II. SIGNATURE STRUCTURAL QUIRKS

### 1. **Side-Aligned Headers (Left Column)**

- Headers live in a **fixed vertical rail** on the left (approx. 15% width).
- They're never top-centered. This instantly breaks symmetry and signals intentional design.

### 2. **Asymmetric Grid**

- Abandon 12-column grid.
- Use a **7-column grid**, prime-numbered to induce tension.
- Columns 1--2 are reserved for meta-commentary or ambient data (e.g., source, time horizon).
- Columns 3--7 carry core content. This asymmetry becomes a signature feel.

### 3. **Persistent Slide Numbering: Countdown Format**

- Every slide has a **countdown** in the bottom-left: e.g., "12 ↓"
- This cultivates a sense of limited runway; forces perceived tempo.

### 4. **Embedded Context Pings**

- Use an icon or glyph (e.g., ⌲ or ⊕) at top-right to signal **context level**:

    - ⌲ = Primary argument

    - ⊕ = Strategic context

    - ≣ = Meta-inference
- Forces the viewer to immediately _categorise_ the content level. Nobody else does this.
* * *

## III. VISUAL DESIGN SCHEME

### 1. **Canvas Format: Dark on Light Grey**

- Background: #F3F3F3
- Text: Charcoal (#111111)
- Accent: Custom neon (e.g., electric acid green #C4FF00 or cyan #00F2FF) used _only_ for deltas or action verbs.

### 2. **Typography Stack**

- **Headers**: All caps. Custom mono-serif (e.g., [Whyte Inktrap, GT America Mono])
- **Body**: Grotesk sans-serif, size 18pt
- **Meta**: Condensed mono, 12pt, grey (#999999)

_Rule_: Every slide uses three distinct fonts--this adds recognisable tension, defies best practices deliberately but precisely.

### 3. **Microcharts Only**

- Charts are _small_ (max 25% slide area), tight, monochrome.
- Pie charts banned.
- Only two chart forms allowed: **line (for delta)** or **stacked bar (for share conflict)**.

### 4. **Black Frames**

- Every slide is enclosed in a **1px black border** with 5px internal padding.
- This creates the feeling of slides as _cards_--each one a standalone artifact.
* * *

## IV. ICONOGRAPHIC STYLE

- Icons are _pixel-grid inspired_, i.e., 8-bit aligned.
- All use **white fill + black stroke**, inverted from standard.
- Max one icon per slide, placed inside a **perfect square glyph container** with thick border (3px).
* * *

## V. SPECIAL ELEMENTS

### 1. **Embedded Footnotes-as-Insight**

- You use **footnotes not to source**, but to _drop sharp secondary insights_.
- Font size 10pt, oblique.
- Slide content says: "Competitor churn rate at 9%."
- Footnote reads: "If this hits 12%, they breach debt covenant."

This _feels_ like inside baseball--makes the deck more powerful by implying layered access.

### 2. **Temporal Glyphs**

- Introduce proprietary time codes:

    - ⏳ = Risk-limited

    - ◷ = Mid-horizon

    - ✦ = Permanent structural

Add one per argument. Creates cognitive shorthand for horizon scanning.

* * *

## VI. TRANSITIONS + NAVIGATION
- No animation.
- **Slide separators** every 3--5 slides:

    - Pure black with single word in neon green, e.g., "DELTA", "RISK", "OBJECTION".

    - These serve as rhetorical inflection points.
* * *

## VII. LAYOUT TEMPLATES

| Slide Type | Layout | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **VERDICT** | Left-rail header + centered large visual + single sentence proof | 
| **DELTA** | Small top-left chart + oversized central number + footnote insight | 
| **STRATEGY** | Three-column layout: Thesis | 
| **META** | Fully text-based, all mono typeface, white background instead of grey | 
| **MOBILISE** | Single command in 44pt caps + countdown timer glyph + black background | 
* * *

## VIII. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE OF THE DECK

**Impression given off**:

- This was authored, not assembled.
- The author has asymmetric information and aesthetic authority.
- If you disagree, you're probably misinformed.
- You're expected to act, not contemplate.
* * *

## IX. IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

- Build this as a custom Figma template with all grid, fonts, and glyphs embedded.
- Assign hotkeys for adding structural glyphs and temporal markers.
- Maintain a 30-slide **reference library** of common proof structures and visual templates.
* * *

This system, **Obsidian Canon**, turns slide design into aesthetic posture, cognitive control, and brand. It doesn't seek consensus. It seeks recognition and leverage.
