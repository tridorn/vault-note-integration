# Review Questions

## Introduction

The review questions are part of the [[Data System]] and are applied for every half an hour time frame. They try to generate as much useful information for later analysis and force the user to reall think of the time frame instead of simply brushing over it.

## List

1. **Primary Activity: Think about the overarching theme of your session. Was it relaxation, unplanned activities, focused work, or perhaps learning? Describe the essence of what you did, regardless of how structured it was.**
	- **Cognitive:** Choose this for sessions involving problem-solving, decision-making, or other intellectual efforts.
	- **Creative:** Select this for sessions where you engaged in artistic or innovative activities requiring imagination.
	- **Learning:** Applicable to sessions primarily focused on acquiring new knowledge or skills.
	- **Administrative:** For sessions that involved organizational or managerial tasks.
	- **Physical:** Choose this for sessions that required significant physical effort or activity.
	- **Social:** Appropriate for sessions mainly involving interaction with others.
	- **Personal:** Use this for sessions focused on personal care, hobbies, or leisure activities.
	- **Unplanned:** If the session evolved spontaneously without a predefined plan.
	- **Pause:** For breaks or rest periods aimed at rejuvenation.
	- **Unstructured:** For sessions characterized by spontaneous or varied activities without a predefined plan or specific focus.
	
2. **Overall Engagement: Consider how mentally and emotionally present you were. Were you deeply engaged, or did your mind wander? Did you feel actively involved in whatever you were doing?**
	- **1-2: Very low engagement** – You were largely distracted or disinterested.
	- **3-4: Somewhat engaged** – Your focus was intermittent.

	- **Aligned:** The session’s activities were in strong alignment with your broader goals or principles.
	- **Partially Aligned:** There was some alignment, but not entirely.
	- **Not Aligned:** The session did not align with your broader goals or principles.
	
5. **Energy Level: Think about your overall vitality and alertness. Were you feeling energetic and lively, or more on the low-energy side?**
	- **1-2: Very low energy** – Felt sluggish or fatigued throughout the session.
	- **3-4: Low energy** – Less energetic than usual.
	- **5-6: Moderate energy** – Felt normal and adequately energized.
	- **7-8: High energy** – Felt active and vigorous.
	- **9-10: Very high energy** – Felt exceptionally lively and alert.
	
6. **Emotional State: Reflect on your emotions during the session. Were you generally happy, stressed, calm, anxious, or something else?**
	- **1-2: Very negative** – Felt stressed, anxious, or unhappy.

	- **9-10: Very positive** – Felt great, very happy, or excited.
	
7. **Session Fulfilment: Reflect on your sense of satisfaction or accomplishment. Did this time feel well-spent in the context of your personal goals or well-being, whether it was productive in a traditional sense or not?**
	- **Fully Fulfilled:** The session was deeply rewarding and brought a high level of satisfaction. It was rich in meaning, enjoyment, or accomplishment, resonating well with your personal values or needs.  
	- **Partially Fulfilled:** The session had its satisfying moments and certain benefits, but it also left something to be desired. Parts of the session were fulfilling, while others were not as much as you would have hoped.  
	- **Not Fulfilled*:** The session fell short in providing personal satisfaction, enjoyment, or a sense of achievement. It felt like the time could have been utilized in a more fulfilling way.

## Primary Activity

1. **Cognitive**: These tasks typically require focused mental effort, such as problem-solving, planning, or decision-making. Examples might include writing a report, researching a complex topic, or learning a new skill.
2. **Creative**: These tasks involve creating something new or thinking in non-traditional ways. Examples might include designing a graphic, brainstorming ideas, or writing creatively.
3. **Administrative**: These tasks often involve organizing, scheduling, or managing resources. Examples include responding to emails, scheduling meetings, or managing budgets.
4. **Physical**: These tasks require physical effort. Examples could include tasks related to physical exercise, household chores, or any manual work if it's part of your routine.
5. **Social**: These tasks involve interacting with other people. Examples could include networking, meetings, phone calls, or collaborative work with colleagues.
6. **Relaxation/Rest**: These periods may not involve a "task" per se, but it's important to account for times when you're taking a break, meditating, or engaging in a relaxing activity like reading or listening to music.
7. **Learning**: These tasks involve acquiring new knowledge or skills. This can be through reading, online courses, attending seminars or workshops, etc.
8. **Personal**: This can be a catch-all for tasks that are primarily related to your personal life, such as errands, family responsibilities, or personal hobbies.
9. **Unplanned:** Life is unpredictable and sometimes unplanned tasks or events occur. This category allows you to take account of these instances without breaking the structure of your system. In the data review, you can analyze how often these instances occur, their impact on your productivity, and perhaps find ways to minimize or better manage them.
10. **Pause:** This category is essential for rest, breaks, and rejuvenation periods. It acknowledges that these are not only necessary but also a planned and integrated part of your day.

## Overall Engagement

**Definition:** Engagement refers to how mentally and emotionally involved you were in the session's activities. High engagement typically means you were deeply focused or absorbed in what you were doing.

**Relevance:** Engagement is a key indicator of the quality of your attention and focus. Understanding your engagement levels can help identify which types of activities are most mentally stimulating for you, and at what times of day you are most capable of deep work. It can also signal when a task or activity might not be aligning well with your interests or skills, prompting you to make adjustments.

**Engagement** provides insights into your work patterns and helps optimize your focus and productivity.

## Alignment with Goals/Principles

**Definition:** This assesses how well the activities in a session align with your broader life goals or guiding principles. It's a measure of congruence between your daily actions and your long-term aspirations or values.

**Relevance:** This aspect is vital for ensuring that your day-to-day activities are not just random or solely driven by immediate demands, but are instead coherently structured towards long-term meaningful achievements and personal growth. Regularly assessing alignment helps keep you on track toward your larger objectives and ensures that your actions are consistently meaningful and purpose-driven.

**Alignment** keeps you connected to your broader goals and principles, ensuring that your daily activities are contributing to your long-term success and fulfillment.

## Energy Levels

Feeling for your energy levels may seem abstract at first, but with some practice, it can become a fairly intuitive process. Here are some guidelines to help you better gauge your energy levels:

1. **Physical cues:** Pay attention to physical signs like the heaviness of your eyelids, yawns, a decrease in movement speed, or an increase in restlessness or fidgeting. 

2. **Mental alertness:** Take note of your mental clarity. Are you easily focused, or are you finding it hard to concentrate? If tasks that are normally easy seem difficult, your energy might be low.

3. **Mood:** Your emotional state can also reflect your energy level. Irritability, frustration, or a lack of patience can sometimes signal a drop in energy.

4. **Performance:** Pay attention to how well you're doing tasks. If your performance is dropping or tasks are taking longer than usual, it might indicate lower energy levels.

To translate these feelings into a numeric scale, consider the following:

- **1:** You're feeling very tired, unfocused, and need rest urgently. Tasks are extremely difficult to complete.
- **2:** You're low on energy and having trouble focusing. You're making more mistakes than usual.
- **3:** You're neither fully energized nor really tired. You're able to perform tasks but not at your peak.
- **4:** You're feeling good, focused, and can handle most tasks well.
- **5** You're feeling extremely energetic and focused. You're able to perform even challenging tasks effectively and efficiently.

Remember that these numbers are subjective and personal to you. What feels like a 5 for you might be different for someone else. Try to be consistent with your ratings, and over time you'll develop a better understanding of your own energy scale.

## Session Fulfillment

**Definition:** This measures the subjective sense of satisfaction or achievement you experience after a session. It's about how content you feel with how the time was spent, regardless of the specific activities involved.

**Relevance:** Fulfillment is crucial for long-term motivation and mental well-being. A session that is fulfilling, even if it's not traditionally productive (like rest or leisure), can contribute to overall life satisfaction and prevent burnout. This metric helps ensure that your time management approach supports not just productivity but also personal happiness and well-being.

**Fulfillment** ensures that your approach to time management is sustainable and supports your mental and emotional health.

## Delineation of Productivity and Session Fulfilment

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the concepts of session fulfillment and productivity, particularly how they differ and complement each other in the context of your session management system:

1. **Session Fulfillment:**
	- **Definition:** Session fulfillment is a measure of personal satisfaction or contentment with how you spent the time in a session. It's about the subjective sense of accomplishment, enjoyment, or value gained from the session.
	- **Characteristics:**
	  - **Subjective Nature:** Fulfillment is highly personal and subjective. What feels fulfilling to one person might not feel the same to another.
	  - **Broader than Productivity:** Fulfillment can be derived from activities that aren't traditionally productive, such as relaxation, leisure activities, or personal time.
	  - **Emotional Component:** Fulfillment is closely tied to emotional states. A fulfilling session leaves you feeling positive, content, or uplifted.
	- **Assessment:** When assessing fulfillment, you're asking, "Did this session make me feel good about how I spent my time?" This can include feelings of relaxation, happiness from social interactions, or the satisfaction of completing a task.

2. **Productivity:**
	- **Definition:** Productivity in your system is about how effectively you achieved the objective of the session, whether it was a specific task, a personal goal, or simply relaxation.
	- **Characteristics:**
	  - **Objective Measurement:** Productivity is more quantifiable and objective. It's about how much you accomplished in relation to your session's goal.
	  - **Task-Oriented:** Typically, productivity is associated with tasks or goals, and how efficiently these were completed.
	  - **Outcome-Focused:** The focus here is on the output or the result of the session, not just the process.
	- **Assessment:** When evaluating productivity, the question is, "Did I achieve what I set out to do in this session?" This involves looking at the completion of tasks or the achievement of specific session objectives.

**Delineation and Complementarity:**

- **Delineation:** While session fulfillment is about the qualitative, emotional satisfaction from a session, productivity is about the quantitative, task-based achievements. Fulfillment is broader and encompasses emotional well-being, while productivity is more focused on task completion and efficiency.

- **Complementarity:** These two concepts, though different, complement each other. A balanced session ideally should be both fulfilling and productive. Fulfillment ensures that you're not just mechanically completing tasks but also deriving joy and satisfaction from your activities. Meanwhile, productivity ensures that you're making tangible progress towards your goals.

In summary, in your session management system, both fulfillment and productivity are crucial. They serve different purposes but together contribute to a well-rounded and satisfying use of your time.

## Edge Cases for Unplanned Work

Addressing time frames where no formal planning or structured work was done is important for a holistic analysis. For such scenarios, you can adapt the definitions of engagement, productivity, and other metrics to fit a broader range of activities, including unplanned or spontaneous sessions. Here’s how you might approach this:

1. **Engagement in Unplanned Sessions:**
	- **Assessment:** Evaluate how mentally and emotionally involved you were during the session, regardless of whether it was planned. For example, even if you spontaneously decided to read a book, go for a walk, or engage in a casual conversation, consider how focused or absorbed you were in that activity.
	- **Edge Case Handling:** If the session involved aimless or passive activities (like mindlessly scrolling through social media), your engagement level might naturally be lower. In such cases, a lower engagement score would accurately reflect the nature of the session.

2. **Productivity in Unplanned Sessions:**
	- **Assessment:** Measure productivity in terms of how effectively the time was used, according to the nature of the activity. If the session turned into a rest period, for instance, assess how rejuvenating it was. If it was an impromptu meeting or discussion, consider how constructive or beneficial it was.
	- **Edge Case Handling:** There might be sessions where 'productivity' in the traditional sense isn't applicable, such as a period of relaxation or unexpected interruptions. In such cases, you could either skip this metric or adapt it to fit the context (e.g., how 'productive' the break was for your well-being).

3. **Session Fulfillment in Unplanned Scenarios:**
	- **Assessment:** Reflect on whether the session, despite being unplanned, was satisfying or beneficial in some way.
	- **Edge Case Handling:** If the session was spent in a manner that felt like a waste of time or unfulfilling, it's valid to rate it as low in fulfillment. This acknowledgment can be useful for future planning and time management.

4. **Other Edge Cases to Consider:**
	- **Unexpected Events:** How to categorize and assess sessions that are disrupted or dominated by unforeseen events.
	- **Mixed Activities:** Sessions that contain a blend of different activities, making it hard to categorize them under a single primary task type.
	- **Low Activity Periods:** Times when very little happens, such as waiting periods or times when you were feeling indecisive or unmotivated.

For these edge cases, a flexible approach in your assessment is key. The aim is to capture the essence of how each half-hour was spent and its impact on your overall goals, well-being, and productivity, rather than strictly adhering to predefined categories or expectations.
