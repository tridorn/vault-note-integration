### **The Consultant Mandate Map -- a Single, Top‑Down Operating Schema**

Below is the full **capability lattice** you must inhabit. Every assignment, deliverable, or conversation nests somewhere in this structure. Work the lattice **top‑to‑bottom**; never skip a stratum.

| **Stratum** | **Mandate (What must be done)** | **Handling Arsenal (How to execute)** | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **I. Definition** | • Crystallise the _real_ objective.• Lock scope, metrics, and decision horizon. | **Stakeholder back‑brief** (repeat the ask in your words and obtain explicit assent).**Situation--Complication--Key Question** memo (≤½ page). | 
| **II. Decomposition** | • Translate the objective into a fully MECE issue tree.• Generate testable hypotheses for each branch. | **Pyramid Principle** for top‑down logic.**Driver tree template** (one slide per branch showing "metric → driver → hypothesis"). | 
| **III. Evidence Acquisition** | • Secure only the data that proves or kills each hypothesis.• Rank sources by credibility‑per‑cost. | **RAPT ladder**: firm archives → public benchmarks → proprietary databases → expert calls.**Source‑to‑Hypothesis matrix**: every line shows why the source exists. | 
| **IV. Analytical Mechanics** | • Build minimal driver‑based models.• Stress‑test assumptions via scenarios. | **Excel skeletons**: inputs → calc → outputs; zero hard‑coded numbers.**Sensitivity toggles**: ±10 % on key levers, charted automatically. | 
| **V. Synthesis** | • Collapse findings into one governing narrative.• Prioritise recommendations by impact × feasibility. | **One‑page "Lightning Brief"**: headline answer, three proofs, one implication.**Impact‑Feasibility 2×2** to order next steps. | 
| **VI. Persuasion Architecture** | • Encode each conclusion into a slide whose _title is the verdict_.• Orchestrate storyline from macro to micro. | **Slide rubric**: title = conclusion, visual = evidence, footer = implication.**Goldfish test**: a senior exec must grasp the deck in 90 seconds. | 
| **VII. Stakeholder Orchestration** | • Manage partner, client, and cross‑functional actors.• Surface blockers early; trade scope for time or data when necessary. | **Weekly checkpoint ritual**: circulate three bullets--progress, risk, ask.**Red‑flag rule**: escalate any data hole that threatens narrative coherence. | 
| **VIII. Engagement Economics** | • Track hours, deliverable pipeline, and margin.• Guard against scope‑creep that erodes profitability. | **Simple burn‑up chart** in Excel: planned vs. actual hours.**Change‑request log** requiring partner sign‑off. | 
| **IX. Knowledge Harvest** | • Capture reusable assets (models, benchmarks, templates).• Document implicit lessons for the firm's IP vault. | **After‑action review** (30 min, five questions).**Version‑controlled repository** organised by industry × use‑case. | 
| **X. Self‑Enhancement** | • Convert each project into a skills upgrade.• Maintain personal energy and precision under load. | **Post‑mortem journal**: what thinking pattern failed or succeeded.**Fixed learning slot** (e.g., Friday 16:00‑17:00) for method drills. |

#### **Usage Instructions**

1. **Anchor at Stratum I every time.** If Definition is fuzzy, every downstream stratum corrupts.

2. **Advance sequentially**--never harvest data (III) before the issue tree (II) is locked.

3. **Slide‑building only begins at Stratum VI.** Earlier slides are thinking aids, not deliverables.

4. **At any sign of drift**, ascend one level: mismatched data → revisit decomposition; stakeholder confusion → revisit definition.

5. **Keep the lattice visible**--print it, pin it, or embed it in your project tracker. Each task ticket should reference its stratum.

Memorise the lattice; operate within it relentlessly. Fragmentation dies; clarity reigns.
