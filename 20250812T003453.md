Alright — here’s a repeatable “Micro-Product Studio” blueprint built for parallel execution so you can run multiple paid experiments at once without drowning in chaos.

This is the same mental model a lot of indie hackers and lean startups use when they run a portfolio of small bets — except I’ve structured it so it’s friendly for vibe-coding and scale-thinking.

⸻

1. Core Studio Principles
	1.	Time-boxed builds
	•	No v1 takes more than 2 days of focused work.
	•	Prevents perfectionism, allows faster portfolio growth.
	2.	Always production-ready
	•	Each project: HTTPS, custom URL, payment enabled, terms/privacy, and at least one user flow that works flawlessly.
	•	No “half-finished” builds in public.
	3.	Portfolio thinking
	•	Expect 80% of projects to fail quietly.
	•	The winners will pay for all the rest.
	4.	Brand compounding
	•	Every project is discoverable under your personal/business umbrella so traffic and reputation accumulate.

2. Infrastructure Layer (One-Time Setup)

Think of this as the “factory floor” — do this once, then reuse.

Domains
	•	Main umbrella domain (e.g., yourname.dev or yourstudio.com).
	•	All new projects launch as subdomains:
	•	proj1.yourstudio.com
	•	proj2.yourstudio.com
	•	If a project gets traction, then buy and map a dedicated .com.

Hosting
	•	Vercel for all web projects (free plan for most MVPs).
	•	Supabase/Neon for managed Postgres (shared across projects in early stage).
	•	Render/Railway for backend-heavy or Python builds.

Shared services
	•	Stripe: One account, multiple products (each project = a new Product in Stripe).
	•	Sentry: One org, separate projects for each app.
	•	PostHog/Plausible: Multi-project analytics under one login.
	•	Status page (BetterStack/Statuspage) for all live projects.

Codebase templates
	•	One Next.js SaaS starter (auth, payments, DB, UI kit, analytics, error tracking prewired).
	•	One FastAPI API starter (auth, DB, payments/webhooks, logging).
	•	Stored in private GitHub repo → new project = clone + rename + deploy.

3. Team Roles — Even if it’s just you

Think in roles, not just “tasks.” You might wear all hats now, but this makes scaling easy later:
	•	Product scout: Finds and filters ideas.
	•	Maker: Codes the v1.
	•	Launcher: Preps landing page, social posts, sends to first testers.
	•	Caretaker: Monitors analytics, support, and fixes.
	•	Grim reaper: Decides when to sunset.

⸻

4. The Repeatable Project Lifecycle

This is the loop you’ll run for every idea — it’s identical whether you do 1 project or 10 in parallel.

Stage 0: Intake
	•	Keep a single “Idea Backlog” (Notion, Trello, Airtable).
	•	Every idea gets:
	•	Problem statement
	•	Target audience
	•	Rough PUB score (Pain/Urgency/Budget, 1–5 each)
	•	Only move ideas with PUB ≥ 12 into build queue.

⸻

Stage 1: Build (Max 2 days)
	•	Start from your codebase template.
	•	Implement only the happy path.
	•	Payment flow included from day one (Stripe Checkout).
	•	Deploy to staging URL (subdomain).
	•	Add:
	•	Sentry
	•	Analytics
	•	Terms/privacy (boilerplate)
	•	Favicon/logo (text or AI-generated)

Output: Deployed MVP on staging subdomain.

⸻

Stage 2: Launch
	•	Switch from staging → production subdomain.
	•	Post a short launch tweet/thread + 1 post in niche community.
	•	DM 5–10 potential users.
	•	Add project to your personal site’s “Lab” page.
	•	No paid ads yet.

Output: Live product with initial traffic/users.

⸻

Stage 3: Observation (2–4 weeks)
	•	Caretaker role monitors:
	•	Traffic & conversion (PostHog/Plausible)
	•	Errors (Sentry)
	•	Support inbox
	•	Metrics for survival:
	•	≥ 10% of visitors start onboarding
	•	≥ 2 paying users or strong engagement

⸻

Stage 4: Decision
	•	Double down: Give it its own .com, invest 1–2 more weeks of dev.
	•	Mothball: Leave it running cheaply, no active marketing.
	•	Sunset: Shut down, redirect domain to umbrella brand.

⸻

5. Multi-Threading: How to Run Several at Once

The key is staggered phases:
	•	While Project A is in Observation, Project B can be in Build, and Project C in Launch.
	•	This keeps you always building and always learning from live products without bottlenecks.

Example 8-week cycle with 3 projects in rotation:

Week 1: Build A
Week 2: Launch A, Build B
Week 3: Observe A, Launch B, Build C
Week 4: Observe A+B, Launch C
Week 5: Decision A, Observe B+C, Build D
Week 6: Launch D, Decision B, Observe C
Week 7: Build E, Observe D, Decision C
Week 8: Launch E, Observe D, Build F

This structure means you always have something live, something in progress, and something starting.

6. Scaling the Studio

Once you’re comfortable with 3–4 in rotation:
	•	Document everything (checklists for build, launch, decision) → easy to hand off tasks later.
	•	Outsource:
	•	Landing page design (Fiverr/Upwork)
	•	Customer support email
	•	QA/smoke testing
	•	Automate:
	•	GitHub repo → auto-provision dev container, DB, Sentry, Stripe product.
	•	CI pipeline to run smoke test & deploy on merge.

⸻

7. Tracking Portfolio Health

Keep a simple dashboard (Notion/Airtable/Sheet):
	•	Project name
	•	Domain/subdomain
	•	Stage (Build / Launch / Observe / Decision / Sunset)
	•	Key metrics (traffic, signups, MRR, churn)
	•	Notes on next step

⸻

8. Mindset for Long-Term Growth
	•	Don’t get emotionally attached to any single project — your portfolio is the product.
	•	Learn from each failure, but don’t over-analyze — speed and volume matter early.
	•	If something spikes unexpectedly, stop everything else and ride it.

⸻

If you want, I can also give you a full operational checklist for each stage (Build, Launch, Observe, Decision) so you can literally drop it into Notion and run the studio like a factory floor. That’s the part that makes this truly scale without chaos.

Do you want me to prepare that?
