### Eupator — Initial Business Topology

Focus: minimal capex, immediate cash-flow, maximal knowledge reuse. Everything nests inside **Eupator UG** to preserve liability protection and fiscal clarity.

### Activation Sequence

1. **Month 0** Incorporate UG, open Qonto account, register domains.
2. **Month 0-1** Launch **WebOps** and **VisualOps** as fixed-price offers. Each project financed 50 % up-front; outsource execution at ≤40 % of fee.
3. **Month 2** Spin up **DataOps** using the same freelancer pool for research-heavy PDFs.
4. **Month 3** Package **GrowthOps**; apply internally first to reach inbound lead flow ≥30 % of total.
5. **Month 4-5** Deploy **ComplyKit** and **RecruitFlow**—both are productised hybrids that recombine Tier 1 assets.
6. **Month 6-8** Validate **MetricLens** (low-code SaaS). Requires no fresh capex because WebOps supplies front-end and DataOps supplies commentary engine.
7. **Month 9+** Channel Tier 1 cash surplus into **Veridian** and **MAP Protocol** R\&D; Tier 1 cells carry their own P\&L, so Core Treasury funds only genuine startup burn.

### Money Flow Discipline

* **Tier 1** invoices land in Core Treasury.
* 30 % retained as central buffer, 70 % stays in cell for contractor fees and growth.
* Tier 2 ventures pay internal rates to Tier 1; margin remains inside the group.
* Quarterly sweep of free cash into an “Opportunity Reserve” earmarked for Tier 3 burn or equity co-investments.

---

### Governance Minimalism

* A single **Operating Charter** defines unit autonomy, transfer-pricing, brand policy.
* Weekly 30-minute Steering Council (you + cell leads/freelancers) to set sprint KPIs.
* No additional hierarchy until any unit exceeds €20 k gross / month.

### Immediate Next Step

Write a two-page Service Offer deck covering **WebOps** and **VisualOps**. Price in the mid-four-figure range, include two pilot slots, require 50 % deposit. Send to ten warm Mittelstand leads this week. Execution proves the lattice; theory follows revenue.
