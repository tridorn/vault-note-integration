Absolutely, incorporating **Notion's teamspaces** into your workspace will enhance organization, collaboration, and access control across your company.

## **Implementing The Structure in Notion**

### **Setting Up Teamspaces**

1. **Create Teamspaces for Each AMU and OCD**

	- When a new AMU is formed, create a dedicated teamspace named after the AMU number and code name (e.g., "AMU-003: Phoenix").
	- Similarly, create teamspaces for each OCD (e.g., "HR & Talent Division").

2. **Assign Permissions**

	- **AMU Teamspaces**: Members and relevant leaders have access.
	- **OCD Teamspaces**: Members of the division, leadership, and any AMU members needing access to resources.
	- **Shared Teamspaces**: Open to all employees or specific groups, depending on the purpose.

3. **Customize Templates**

	- Use Notion's template feature to standardize the structure of AMU and OCD teamspaces.
	- Include placeholders for mission details, team members, timelines, and resources.

### **Connecting Teamspaces to the Main Workspace**

- **Link AMU Teamspaces in the Home Dashboard**

  - Under "Active AMUs," include direct links to each AMU's teamspace.

- **Integrate OCD Resources**

  - Embed OCD resources within AMU teamspaces where relevant.
  - Provide quick access to support services, guidelines, and contact points.

- **Cross-Team Communication**

  - Use shared databases and linked pages to facilitate communication between AMUs and OCDs.
  - Implement commenting and @mention features to enhance collaboration.

### **Maintaining Alignment and Transparency**

- **Company OKRs Linked to AMUs**

  - In the "Company OKRs and Strategy" section, link each objective to the relevant AMUs and their teamspaces.

- **Leadership Oversight**

  - Leadership Council and LFOs can have a master view of all teamspaces, with dashboards summarizing progress.

- **Regular Updates**

  - Set up automated reminders for AMUs and OCDs to update their progress, ensuring information stays current.

### **Using Notion Features Effectively**

- **Databases and Views**

  - Utilize databases for tracking AMUs, ideas, and resources.
  - Use different views (table, board, calendar) to display information in the most useful format.

- **Templates**

  - Create and use templates for Mission Books, project pages, meeting notes, and reports to maintain consistency.

- **Integrations**

  - Integrate Notion with other tools (e.g., Slack, Google Drive, Jira) to streamline workflows.

- **Permissions**

  - Carefully manage permissions to ensure sensitive information is protected while maintaining necessary transparency.

---

## **Additional Considerations**

### **Employee Onboarding**

- **Onboarding Teamspace**

  - Create a dedicated space for new employees to learn about the company structure, culture, and how to navigate the Notion workspace.

- **Guides and Tutorials**

  - Provide documentation or tutorials on using Notion, understanding the AMU structure, and accessing resources.

### **Search And Navigation**

- **Global Search**

  - Leverage Notion's search functionality to help users find information across teamspaces.

- **Navigation Menus**

  - Use sidebar navigation and in-page links to improve accessibility.

### **Mobile Access**

- Ensure that the Notion workspace is optimized for mobile devices, allowing team members to access information on the go.

## **Benefits Of This Structure**

- **Scalability**

  - As the company grows, you can add more teamspaces for new AMUs, OCDs, and initiatives without cluttering the main workspace.

- **Focused Collaboration**

  - Teamspaces allow teams to work closely together without distractions, while still being connected to the larger company context.

- **Access Control**

  - Permissions can be managed at the teamspace level, ensuring that sensitive information is only available to those who need it.

- **Alignment with AMU Structure**

  - Reflects the dynamic, mission-based approach of AMUs, facilitating agility and responsiveness.

- **Integration of Culture**

  - Spaces dedicated to culture, wellness, and innovation reinforce these aspects as integral parts of the company, not afterthoughts.

By structuring your Notion workspace with teamspaces aligned to your AMU-based company structure, you create an environment that supports focused teamwork, efficient collaboration, and strategic alignment. This setup ensures that everyone knows where to find the information they need, how to collaborate with others, and how their work contributes to the company's overall mission and objectives.
