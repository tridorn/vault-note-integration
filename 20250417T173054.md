You should have said:  
**“There are too many overlapping words—doctrine, system, framework, method, charter, etc. I want a precise, consistent vocabulary, like in programming or game architecture. Define a canonical lexicon that eliminates ambiguity and standardizes how we talk about each part of this construct.”**

Here is your **Controlled Vocabulary v1.0**—a precise, enforceable lexicon for the **Corpus Principia** system.

# **Controlled Vocabulary – Corpus Principia**

## **I. Foundational Terms**

| Term               | Definition                                                                 | Use Only For                                                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Corpus**          | The full system of thought: the constitutional model + its specifications  | The complete operating doctrine                                       |
| **Doctrine**        | The philosophical rationale and fixed conceptual map behind the Corpus     | Abstract theory and structure                                         |
| **Standard**        | The versioned, formally maintained implementation of the Corpus            | Public or shared use (e.g., v1.0 Corpus Standard)                     |
| **Method**          | A practical application or localized implementation of the Corpus          | Eupator Method = how Eupator uses the Corpus                         |
| **Specification (Spec)** | The concrete breakdown of rules, definitions, and protocols               | The current rulebook of the Corpus                                    |

## **II. Structural Axes (Meta‑Lenses)**

| Term           | Definition                                                 | Use in Place of      |

- Use **Axis** for the category (e.g., Form Axis),  
- Use **Layer** for its internal structure (e.g., Structural Layer of Form Axis)

|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Cluster**       | One of the 12 functional domains within an institution     | Not: “area,” “domain,” “zone” |
| **Cluster Map**   | The complete set of all 12 clusters                        | Synonym: “functional spectrum” (optional poetic form) |

---

## **IV. Execution Tools**

| Term             | Definition                                                | Use Only For                                               |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Diagnostic**    | The assessment process that maps a real org against the Corpus | Scorecards, cluster reviews, typology matching               |
| **Typology**      | A standardized library of archetypes                      | Not: “pattern,” “template,” or “company type”               |
| **Mandate**       | A formally issued rule inside a venture enforcing a part of the Corpus | E.g., “All SOPs must use Protocol v1”                        |
| **Protocol**      | A defined interaction format, often for documentation or handoff | SOP structure, mission brief structure, update format        |

## **V. Governance of the Corpus Itself**

| Term                  | Definition                                               | Use Only For                                 |

| **Steward**            | The responsible role for maintaining, evolving, and interpreting the Corpus | Never “owner,” “admin,” or “author”            |

## **VI. Implementation Contexts**

| Term            | Definition                                                              | Use Only For                         |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|

## **VII. Strict Synonym Rules**

| Forbidden Term      | Use Instead               |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Framework           | Corpus (if total), Axis (if partial)  
| System              | Corpus or Axis, depending on scope  
| Pillar              | Axis  
| Tier                | Layer  
| Domain              | Cluster  
| Rule                | Mandate (if enforced), Protocol (if structural)  
| Guidebook/Handbook  | Manual  
| Owner (of Corpus)   | Steward  
| Method (random use) | Use only for: *“Eupator Method”* as Corpus application

## **VIII. Example – Correct Usage**

> “Eupator applies the **Corpus Principia** as its internal operating **doctrine**. The Corpus consists of three **Axes**—Governance, Form, and Initiative—each with five **Layers**. It spans across twelve **Clusters**, which together form the **Cluster Map**.  
>  
> Each venture must complete a **Diagnostic**, referencing the **Typology Core Set**, and comply with key **Mandates**—e.g., that all SOPs use the v1.0 **Protocol** format.  
>  
> The doctrine is defined in the **Executive Charter**, with implementation governed through the **Manual**, maintained by the acting **Steward**. Eupator is currently the **reference implementation** of the Corpus.”

Would you like me to now deliver a Markdown version of this vocabulary so you can embed it directly into your repository or charter?
