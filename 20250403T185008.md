Below is an **actionable pilot scope** designed to show ProCredit Bank how your platform can **deliver immediate value** and solve a **specific green finance pain point**. This pilot is intentionally narrow: it targets a **single project type** (rooftop solar) within one country/region (we’ll assume Serbia or Romania as an example). That way, ProCredit can see real results and measure success quickly.

# **Pilot: “GreenBridge Solar”**

## **1. Objective**  
To prove that **digitalizing the SME green loan process** (for a specific upgrade type) reduces underwriting time, increases loan volume, and improves the **ROI clarity** for both ProCredit and the SME borrower.

## **2. Pilot Outline**

### **Scope**  
- **Target Region:** One city or region where ProCredit already has SME customers (e.g., Belgrade outskirts or Bucharest area).  
- **Project Focus:** **Rooftop solar installations** for SMEs (typical loan size: €20k–€100k).  
- **Duration:** **3–4 months**, from setup to results.

### **Participants**  
1. **ProCredit Bank**  
   - Pilot sponsor and lender.  
   - Provides relevant SME leads (existing clients with high energy costs).  
   - Commits a small credit line specifically for rooftop solar (e.g., €1–2 million total).  

2. **Solar Vendor Partners**  
   - 2–3 vetted local solar installers.  
   - Offer standardized quotes and performance data for quick loan processing.  

3. **SME Participants**  
   - 20–30 SMEs pre-selected or approached by ProCredit (restaurants, small factories, hotels, retail).  
   - Each is willing to invest in rooftop solar to lower energy bills.  

4. **GreenBridge Platform (You)**  
   - Operates the **digital workflow** for project scoping, application, vendor integration, and compliance checks.  
   - Delivers final loan application packets to ProCredit for underwriting.

## **3. Pilot Workflow**

### **Step 1: SME Registration & Project Scoping**  
1. **SME Logs Into GreenBridge Portal**  
   - Basic sign-up, automatically pulls relevant business info from an API or manual input.  
2. **Energy / Roof Data Input**  
   - The SME enters approximate roof size, monthly energy bills, location.  
3. **Instant Solar ROI Estimate**  
   - GreenBridge calls a simple **solar calculator API** (or embedded formula) to estimate potential kWh generation, cost savings, payback period, and CO₂ reduction.

### **Step 2: Vendor Matching & Quote**  
1. **Vendor Directory**  
   - SME sees a **shortlist of local solar installers** (already vetted by ProCredit).  
2. **Request Quote**  
   - SME requests a free site inspection or preliminary quote from 1–2 installers.  
3. **Quote Finalization**  
   - Once the quote is uploaded to the platform, GreenBridge’s system **consolidates** all data (project cost, expected performance).

### **Step 3: Automated Loan Application Packet**  
1. **Green Compliance Dossier**  
   - The platform **auto-generates** a PDF that includes:  
     - Project summary (size, cost, ROI, carbon savings)  
     - Vendor credentials (license, experience)  
     - Basic SME financial data (credit metrics, payback feasibility)  
   - This dossier **reduces ProCredit’s manual analysis** time.  
2. **One-Click Submission to ProCredit**  
   - The SME finalizes the application with a single button.  
   - ProCredit’s credit team receives a **standardized** application packet via the GreenBridge portal (or email with PDF attachments).

### **Step 4: ProCredit Underwriting & Approval**  
1. **Credit Decision**  
   - ProCredit uses their usual internal scoring but benefits from **fully consistent data** (energy usage, solar ROI, vendor details).  
2. **Conditional Approval**  
   - If needed, bank staff can request clarifications via the GreenBridge portal.  
3. **Loan Issuance**  
   - Approved SMEs sign the loan agreement digitally or in-branch, get funds to pay the vendor.

### **Step 5: Monitoring & Reporting**  
1. **Post-Installation Check**  
   - Vendor confirms installation is complete. The SME optionally uploads post-install photos or data (e.g. a net meter reading).  
2. **Performance Tracking (Optional)**  
   - If the SME can provide utility bills or net-meter data, GreenBridge tracks actual generation.  
   - ProCredit sees a **mini dashboard** verifying that the project is delivering the projected impact (useful for ESG reporting).

## **4. Success Metrics**

1. **Underwriting Speed**  
   - **Target**: 30–40% reduction in time from initial SME inquiry to final credit decision (fewer manual back-and-forth steps).  
2. **Loan Volume**  
   - **Goal**: 20–30 SME installations financed, total of ~€1–2 million within the pilot window.  
3. **ROI Accuracy**  
   - Compare the **projected** cost savings with the SME’s real bills post-installation (for those who share data).  
4. **Customer Satisfaction**  
   - Survey SMEs and ProCredit staff. Aim for a **>80%** satisfaction rate, citing easier process than typical loans.  
5. **CO₂ Reduction**  
   - Summed across all financed solar projects, estimate total annual carbon offset to highlight ProCredit’s green portfolio impact.

## **5. Key Roles & Responsibilities**

- **Your Team (GreenBridge)**  
  - Build/host the pilot platform (secure web portal).  
  - Integrate a basic solar ROI formula or external API.  
  - Onboard 2–3 vendor partners with relevant info.  
  - Provide training/support to ProCredit staff on how to view submissions.

- **ProCredit Bank**  
  - Assign a small pilot budget/credit line for solar projects.  
  - Identify initial SME leads (existing or new).  
  - Provide fast underwriting decisions and feedback.  
  - Partner on marketing (inform local SME community about the pilot).

- **Solar Installers**  
  - Provide standardized quotes and doc templates.  
  - Upload final cost & system specs to the platform.  
  - Confirm installation completion.

- **SME Participants**  
  - Enter their data, choose vendors, finalize quotes, and formally apply for the loan.

## **7. Deliverables & Post-Pilot Path**

1. **Pilot Results Report**  
   - Summarize **key metrics** (loan volume, speed gains, CO₂ impact).  
   - Gather **feedback** from SMEs, vendors, and bank staff.

2. **Refinement Plan**  
   - Identify **workflow improvements** (UI changes, additional data fields) before scaling.  
   - Possibly add other green project types (e.g., HVAC upgrades) in Phase 2.

3. **Scale-Up Proposal**  
   - If ProCredit sees tangible benefits, propose **expanding** the pilot regionally (more cities/countries).  
   - Discuss **white-label** or deeper integration with ProCredit’s systems.  
   - Explore adding **grant or subsidy** matching features in collaboration with local governments/EBRD, etc.

## **8. Why This Pilot Brings Real Value to ProCredit**

1. **Immediate Green Loan Growth**  
   - Pilot focuses on a **high-demand** project type (solar), so there’s a natural pipeline of SMEs wanting to cut energy bills.

2. **Reduced Manual Work**  
   - Standardized data means ProCredit’s underwriters spend **less time** chasing documents or verifying vendor claims.

3. **ESG & Regulatory Wins**  
   - Quick demonstration of **sustainable financing** in ProCredit’s portfolio, feeding into official ESG metrics.

4. **Positive PR**  
   - ProCredit can **publicize** the pilot’s success: “We financed 20 new solar installations for local SMEs, enabling them to save X amount of energy and reduce Y tons of CO₂.”

5. **Path to Larger Digital Transformation**  
   - If this pilot works, ProCredit has a **blueprint** to handle other types of green projects at scale, possibly across multiple countries.

## **Final Thoughts**

This scoped pilot is **concrete**—it tackles a single, **high-impact** green upgrade (rooftop solar), letting you prove your platform’s worth quickly. ProCredit sees an **immediate ROI** in reduced underwriting times and expanded green lending. Meanwhile, you lay the groundwork for **broader infrastructure** by building out a re-usable, data-driven, compliance-friendly workflow that can eventually handle **insulation, EV fleets, HVAC** upgrades, and beyond.

**If ProCredit needs further clarity**, emphasize:
- **Specific deliverables** (portal access, number of SMEs targeted)  
- **Risks** (mainly adoption, but mitigated by vendor/bank partnerships)  
- **Early success metrics** (time saved, loan volume, SME satisfaction)

This pilot approach **balances ambition and feasibility**, setting you up for a strong scale-up phase. Let me know if you need any further detail or an even more granular timeline!
