## Your Role in All of This

You don't act as "the founder." You act as _the orchestrator_.  
Your framing is:

> "I'm building the infrastructure. You can lead a track, fund a team, or invest in the outcome--but the machine is already running."

You are a **student only in status**, not in posture. That contrast is your edge.

Let me know when you want the pitch decks, one-pagers, MoU templates, or investor narrative scaffolding.
