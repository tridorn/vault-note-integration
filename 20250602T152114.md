Correction of your request:  
Rather than "Could you devise such an adaptive framework?", a more precise formulation would be: **"Define a minimal set of modular, enduring spheres of concern that structurally organise digital identity, operations, and strategic presence across changing tools and roles."**

* * *

**Framework: Modular Spheres of Digital Sovereignty**

The following spheres represent the irreducible domains necessary to sustainably govern a high-agency, multi-persona digital existence. They are abstracted from transient tools, identities, or brands. Each sphere answers a different strategic question and demands differentiated logic of control, exposure, and integration.

### 1. **Control Sphere**

**Function**: Sovereignty over credentials, recovery, and authorisation mechanisms.  
**Concern**: _Who controls access?_  
**Key Components**: Root email accounts, 2FA devices, password managers, encryption keys, legal ownership of domains, recovery mechanisms.  
**Implication**: Fragmentation here is existential risk. This sphere must be highly centralised, deeply redundant, and strictly off-limits to fluid tooling.

* * *

### 2. **Identity Sphere**

**Function**: Management of personal vs. public personae, brands, aliases.  
**Concern**: _Who is seen?_  
**Key Components**: Email addresses (by persona), usernames, social handles, profile images, bios, public keys, personal vs. brand presentation logic.  
**Implication**: Needs deliberate partitioning by intentional exposure logic (e.g., legal name vs. brand moniker). Maintain internal consistency per identity but support parallel tracks.

* * *

### 3. **Comms & Coordination Sphere**

**Function**: Orchestration of calendaring, messaging, collaboration, notifications.  
**Concern**: _How is time and attention allocated and aligned?_  
**Key Components**: Email clients, calendars, messaging apps, task managers, notifications strategy.  
**Implication**: Must interoperate with all other spheres but remain persona-agnostic in tooling logic (e.g., central calendar surface, routed comms rules). Requires intentional boundaries around notification fatigue and cross-context contamination.

* * *

### 4. **Content & Thought Capital Sphere**

**Function**: Curation, drafting, and dissemination of intellectual output.  
**Concern**: _What is produced, stored, and shared?_  
**Key Components**: Notes, articles, drafts, published works, research repositories, content pipelines.  
**Implication**: Requires strong version control and persona-aware publishing paths. Drafting spaces should be neutral; publishing channels strictly identity-bound.

* * *

### 5. **Operational Sphere**

**Function**: Execution of day-to-day activities: work, personal admin, project tasks.  
**Concern**: _What gets done, and how?_  
**Key Components**: Workspaces, tools, files, processes, admin, automations.  
**Implication**: Should be abstracted into roles (employee, founder, operator) rather than personae. Persona distinctions re-emerge only at interface/publishing level.

* * *

### 6. **Ownership & Legal Sphere**

**Function**: Structuring of legal, financial, and asset-holding entities.  
**Concern**: _Who owns what, and under what terms?_  
**Key Components**: Legal names, IDs, contracts, bank accounts, companies (e.g., Eupator), tax records.  
**Implication**: Tied to personal identity, but must project outward cleanly through entities. Needs long-term jurisdictional strategy and clear division of liabilities.

* * *

### 7. **Experimentation & Sandbox Sphere**

**Function**: Isolated space for testing tools, workflows, integrations.  
**Concern**: _Where is failure safe?_  
**Key Components**: Secondary accounts, temporary identities, test automation environments, staging areas.  
**Implication**: Prevents polluting core identities and operations with unproven tools. Enables agility without compromise of security or clarity.

* * *

These seven spheres are sufficient. All digital complexity can be subsumed under them. Each new tool or identity must be assigned to one or more spheres based on primary concern, not branding or account origin.

Let me know if you want implementation logic or mapping against current accounts.
