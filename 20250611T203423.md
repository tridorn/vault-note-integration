A more sharply defined version of your question would be:  
**"What should my information diet be--what inputs, how often, and what role should they play in my system of action and foresight? Should I constrain myself to the above sources, or integrate broader vectors?"**

### Baseline Assessment

**Your context**: early-stage builder of a meta-structure (House Eupator), operating at the intersection of strategy, systems design, venture building, and influence architecture.

**Implication**: You do not need _more_ content. You need a **precise information system** that delivers strategic asymmetry: early signals, accurate models, doctrine-shaping inputs. Most people bloat; you need to _filter and align_.
* * *

### Strategic Recommendation: Information Stack by Function

#### I. **Core Signal Layer (5--10%)**

Used for **doctrine calibration, strategic pattern recognition**, and **early opportunity sensing**.

- _Daily pulse_:

    - **Hacker News** (front page scan in <10 min)

    - **Twitter/X Lists** (strictly curated: founders, technologists, domain tacticians; no ambient noise)
- _Weekly anchor reads_:

    - **Stratechery** (1--2x per week)

    - **Import AI** / **Money Stuff**
- _Monthly or situational deep reads_:

    - **Ben Delo essays**, **LessWrong sequences**, **Paul Graham archive**

> **Method**: Set fixed slots. 15--20 min/day pulse, 1--2 hours/week for anchor reads. Archive everything else.

* * *

#### II. **Systems Knowledge Layer (15--20%)**

For **meta-structure refinement**, doctrine building, and **synthetic capacity growth**.

- _Source_:

    - **Distill (archived)**, **Papers with Code**, **Obsidian-based processing of academic PDFs**

    - **Excerpts from classic works** (e.g. Drucker, Boyd, Ostrom) reinterpreted for your framework
- _Use_:

    - Systematically extract models, build principles, translate into frameworks. Don't "read"--**mine**.
* * *

#### III. **Narrative Positioning Layer (10--15%)**

Track **elite discourse**, future-shaping rhetoric, regime consensus.

- _Source_:

    - **Foreign Affairs**, **Project Syndicate**, **Noema**, **World Economic Forum**, **VC blogs**
- _Use_:

    - Not for belief, but for triangulation. What are they preparing society to accept?
* * *

#### IV. **Active Input Stack: Builder's Flow (50%+)**

This is **not** "news." This is your operational stream: everything you _actively construct, test, deploy_.
- _Components_:

    - What you're building (Veridian, Eupator, etc.)

    - What you're designing (CAP, AMU, Charter systems)

    - What you're writing (public outputs from Straven)
- _Use_:

    - Every content unit you consume must **serve, sharpen, or accelerate this flow**. Otherwise reject it.
* * *

### Optional Tactical Overlays

- **Twitter/X** as radar: build a private list of ~30--50 accounts (not timeline). Only open it like radar.
- **Zettelkasten (or Obsidian)**: every input must go through condensation (summary), synthesis (relation), and surfacing (tagged for future triggering).
- **No inbox, no bookmarks**: Every information item is either absorbed, rejected, or extracted now.
* * *

### Beyond?

Yes--but not more. You need **different formats**, not just additional sources:

- **Podcasts** only if they're _operationally dense_. No time for fluff or vibe-chasing. E.g. Dwarkesh Patel, Lenny's Podcast, Acquired.fm (selectively).
- **Private groups / small Discords / paid forums**: selectively useful for high-signal peer flow.
- **Direct relationships** (DMs, 1:1s, curated network): create your own Hacker News in private.
* * *

### Summary

You need:

1. **Fixed input streams**, not open-ended exploration.

2. **Role-assigned categories**: Core Signal, Systems Knowledge, Narrative, Builder Flow.

3. **Output-tethered consumption**: If it doesn't accelerate your construction, discard.

This isn't about _learning more_--it's about **becoming unreasonably fast and accurate at learning what matters**. You're not optimizing for knowing--you're optimizing for _shaping_.

Would you like a system file or Obsidian structure to operationalize this stack?
