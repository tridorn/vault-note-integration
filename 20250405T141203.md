## **Delivery Tips for the Live Pitch**

1. **Keep Slides Lean**  
   - Fewer words, bigger font. Let **you** do the explaining.  
2. **Use Emotional, Clear Headings**  
   - The headers serve as **“mini narratives”**—they grab attention and set the tone each slide.  
3. **Sprinkle Micro-Data**  
   - “40% underwriting time cut,” “€1 trillion opportunity,” “SMEs are 99% of EU businesses,” etc. Keep them short but impactful.  
4. **Storyboard**  
   - Practice your transitions: from the problem → friction → solution → pilot → ask.  
5. **Time It**  
   - Aim for **8–10 minutes** total, with 2–3 minutes for Q&A in a typical short pitch setting. Adjust if you have a longer slot.
