 1 Version 1

You're right in pointing out that having the **Leadership Council** directly brief every AMU might become an overwhelming task, especially as the company grows and more missions are assigned. To maintain the **balance between strategic alignment** and **operational efficiency**, a structured **communication hierarchy** ensures that **strategic objectives** are effectively communicated to AMUs without overloading the Leadership Council.

Here’s how this process typically unfolds:

---

### **1. Leadership Council Sets Strategic Direction**

The **Leadership Council** remains responsible for formulating the **high-level strategy**, including defining **core objectives**, **company vision**, and **long-term priorities**. However, they do not directly brief each AMU. Instead, they set the strategic direction and communicate this through **key intermediaries** within the company.

The **Leadership Council** focuses on:

- Creating and communicating the **broad strategic vision**.
- Defining **company-wide initiatives** and major goals.
- Ensuring there is alignment across all operational and strategic levels.

---

### **2. Leadership Field Officers (LFOs) as Strategic Facilitators**

**Leadership Field Officers (LFOs)** play a critical role in **communicating the strategy** to the AMUs. Instead of the **Leadership Council** briefing every AMU, the **LFOs** act as the **key strategic intermediaries** who bridge the gap between high-level strategy and the execution teams (AMUs).

#### **How LFOs Brief AMUs:**

- **LFOs receive direct briefings** from the Leadership Council on strategic objectives and priorities for their areas of responsibility.
- They are responsible for translating the **high-level strategic vision** into **specific mission objectives** that are then communicated to the AMUs.
- LFOs ensure that each AMU understands its role in the broader strategy by providing the necessary **context, rationale, and expected outcomes**.

#### **Advantages Of LFOs as Briefers:**

- LFOs maintain **close relationships with AMUs** and can contextualize the strategy based on each team’s specific mission.
- They **provide ongoing support** and guidance, ensuring that strategic objectives are understood throughout the mission lifecycle, not just at the beginning.
- **Delegation** of briefings reduces the workload on the Leadership Council and ensures the briefing process remains **scalable** as the company grows.

---

### **3. AMU Leaders as Tactical Briefers**

While **LFOs provide strategic context**, the **AMU Leaders** themselves are responsible for **translating that strategy into operational terms** for their teams. After being briefed by the LFOs, AMU Leaders communicate the **mission-specific goals** and ensure that their teams understand how these goals tie into the **overall company strategy**.

#### **Role Of AMU Leaders in Briefing:**

- **Tactical Translation**: AMU Leaders break down the mission objectives into **day-to-day tasks** and actionable steps that their teams can execute.
- **Clarifying Strategic Alignment**: They ensure that every team member understands **how their individual work contributes** to the company’s broader goals.
- **Continuous Communication**: AMU Leaders hold **regular briefings** and stand-ups to keep the team aligned with both the mission goals and the overarching strategy as the mission progresses.

#### **Example:**

- The Leadership Council sets a high-level goal to **expand into a new international market**.
- The LFO briefs an **AMU Leader** on the specific role their AMU will play, such as **localizing a product** for that market.
- The AMU Leader then briefs their team, detailing **specific tasks** (e.g., translation, regulatory compliance, localization) and explaining how their efforts are essential to the overall market expansion strategy.

---

### **4. Documentation and Asynchronous Communication**

To further ease the workload on the Leadership Council and LFOs, strategic briefings are often **documented and made accessible** to all AMU teams. This ensures that strategic alignment doesn’t rely solely on verbal communication and allows teams to **reference key documents** whenever needed.

#### **How Documentation Supports the Process:**

- **Strategic Briefing Documents**: The Leadership Council or LFOs can create **written strategy briefings** that outline the company’s goals, key initiatives, and expected outcomes. These documents can be housed in tools like **Confluence, Notion**, or any central document repository.
- **Mission-Specific Guidelines**: Each AMU receives a **mission-specific briefing document** that links their tasks and milestones to the broader strategic goals.
- **Ongoing Access**: AMU members can access these documents throughout the mission, ensuring continuous alignment even if they were not part of the initial brief.

---

### **5. Recap of the Communication Flow**

Here’s a step-by-step flow of how strategic communication is managed to ensure that AMUs remain aligned without overwhelming the Leadership Council:

1. **Leadership Council Sets Strategy**:
	- Defines **high-level objectives** and priorities for the company.
	- Briefs the **LFOs** on key strategic areas and priorities.

2. **LFOs Translate Strategy**:
	- LFOs receive briefings and **tailor the strategy** to the specific missions they oversee.
	- They brief AMU Leaders on the **strategic context** and the **specific role** their AMU plays in achieving the company’s goals.

3. **AMU Leaders Translate to Teams**:
	- AMU Leaders break down the mission into **actionable tasks** and brief their team members on how their work contributes to the broader strategy.
	- They ensure **continuous alignment** through regular stand-ups, sprint reviews, and debriefs.

4. **Documentation and Access**:
	- Strategic and mission briefs are documented and made available to all team members to ensure **transparency** and **alignment**.
	- AMU members can refer to these documents at any point to stay aligned with the broader goals.

### **6. Scalability and Efficiency in Strategic Communication**

This hierarchical structure ensures that the **Leadership Council** is not burdened with the operational work of briefing every AMU while ensuring that the company’s strategy is **clearly communicated** at all levels. It allows for a **scalable communication process** that adapts as the company grows:

- **LFOs and AMU Leaders** can adjust how they deliver the strategy based on the **complexity** of the mission and the **experience** of the team.
- The **use of documentation** ensures that key strategic information is consistently available and doesn’t rely solely on meetings or briefings.

---

### **Conclusion: Ensuring Strategic Alignment Without Overload**

The allocation of **briefing responsibilities** to LFOs and AMU Leaders ensures that strategic communication flows effectively without overwhelming the Leadership Council. By using a structured communication flow, involving LFOs as intermediaries, and supplementing verbal briefings with **accessible documentation**, the company ensures that every AMU remains aligned with the overarching strategy—without creating excessive work for the leadership team. 

This system is **scalable** and ensures that **strategic continuity** is maintained, even as leadership rotates within AMUs or as the company expands its operations.
