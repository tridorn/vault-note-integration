# Structure and Templates of LMS 2

#### 1. **Set Up Your Vault and Folder Structure**

1. **Create a New Vault**:
   - Open Obsidian and create a new vault named something like `Personal Framework`.

2. **Organize Folders**:
   - Inside the vault, create folders for each core component:
     - `Objectives`
     - `Categories`
     - `Sub-topics`
     - `Research`
     - `Goals`
     - `Action Plans`
     - `Resources`
     - `Implementation`
     - `Monitoring`
     - `Review`
     
   - Optionally, create folders for each main topic (e.g., `Health`, `Finance`, etc.), and within those, sub-folders for specific sub-topics if needed.

#### 2. **Create Template Notes for Each Component**

Using Obsidian's template feature, you can create consistent notes for each component. Install the **Templater** plugin from the Community Plugins section if you haven't already. This will allow you to use templates effectively.

1. **Objective Template**:
   - Create a template note for objectives in the `Templates` folder. Here’s an example structure:

   ```markdown
   # Objective: title
   
   **Date:** date
   
   **Description:**
   - Describe the objective here.
   
   **Why is this important?**
   - Explanation of importance.
   
   **Link to Related Categories:**
   - [[Category 1]]
   - [[Category 2]]
   ```

2. **Category Template**:
   - Create a template for categories:

   ```markdown
   # Category: title
   
   **Main Objectives:**
   - [[Objective 1]]
   - [[Objective 2]]
   
   **Description:**
   - Overview of the category.
   
   **Sub-topics:**
   - [[Sub-topic 1]]
   - [[Sub-topic 2]]
   ```

3. **Sub-topic Template**:
   - Create a template for sub-topics:

   ```markdown
   # Sub-topic: title
   
   **Category:** [[Category Name]]
   
   **Goals:**
   - [[Goal 1]]
   - [[Goal 2]]
   
   **Research and Resources:**
   - [[Research Note 1]]
   - [[Research Note 2]]
   ```

4. **Goal Template**:
   - Create a template for goals:

   ```markdown
   # Goal: title
   
   **Sub-topic:** [[Sub-topic Name]]
   
   **Description:**
   - Define the goal clearly.
   
   **Deadline:** date
   
   **Action Plans:**
   - [[Action Plan 1]]
   - [[Action Plan 2]]
   ```

5. **Action Plan Template**:
   - Create a template for action plans:

   ```markdown
   # Action Plan: title
   
   **Goal:** [[Goal Name]]
   
   **Steps:**
   1. Step one
   2. Step two
   3. Step three
   
   **Resources Needed:**
   - Time: XX hours/week
   - Money: $XX
   - Tools: [[Tool 1]], [[Tool 2]]
   
   **Implementation Status:**
   - Status: Not started/In progress/Completed
   ```

6. **Monitoring and Evaluation Template**:
   - Create a template for monitoring:

   ```markdown
   # Monitoring and Evaluation: title
   
   **Goal:** [[Goal Name]]
   
   **Progress Summary:**
   - Describe progress here.
   
   **Successes:**
   - Successes achieved.
   
   **Challenges:**
   - Challenges encountered.
   
   **Next Steps:**
   - Actions to take next.
   ```

7. **Review Template**:
   - Create a template for reviews:

   ```markdown
   # Review: title
   
   **Date:** date
   
   **Goals Reviewed:**
   - [[Goal 1]]
   - [[Goal 2]]
   
   **Overall Assessment:**
   - General assessment of progress.
   
   **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Describe any necessary changes.
   
   **New Goals:**
   - [[New Goal 1]]
   - [[New Goal 2]]
   ```

#### 3. **Linking Notes and Using Backlinks**

- **Linking Notes**:
  - Use Obsidian’s linking feature to create connections between notes. For example, link objectives to related categories, categories to sub-topics, and sub-topics to goals. This creates a web of interconnected notes that you can navigate easily.

- **Backlinks and Graph View**:
  - Use backlinks to see all notes related to a specific topic or goal. The Graph View will help visualize the entire framework, showing how different components are interconnected.

#### 4. **Populating the Framework**

- **Objectives**:
  - Start by creating notes for each major objective using the Objective Template. Link these objectives to relevant categories.

- **Categories and Sub-topics**:
  - Create notes for each category and sub-topic, linking them to objectives and goals. Use the templates for consistency.

- **Research and Resources**:
  - As you gather information, create notes under the Research folder and link them to relevant sub-topics.

- **Goals and Action Plans**:
  - Develop goals for each sub-topic and create detailed action plans. Use the linking features to connect these notes to sub-topics and resources.

- **Monitoring and Review**:
  - Regularly update the monitoring and evaluation notes. Schedule reviews to reflect on progress and make necessary adjustments.

#### 5. **Advanced Features and Plugins**

- **Task Management**:
  - Use plugins like **Obsidian Tasks** to manage tasks within your notes, creating checklists and setting due dates for action items.

- **Dataview Plugin**:
  - Consider using the **Dataview Plugin** to create dynamic tables and views of your notes. This can help you visualize goals, tasks, and progress in a more organized way.

#### Example of Implementing the Framework

Let’s say you want to improve your health. Here's how you might set this up:

1. **Create an Objective Note**:
   - Use the Objective Template to create a note titled “Improve Overall Health.”
   - Link it to categories like `Health` and `Fitness`.

2. **Develop Category Notes**:
   - Create a note for `Health` and link it to sub-topics like `Nutrition`, `Exercise`, and `Mental Health`.

3. **Detail Sub-topics**:
   - Under `Nutrition`, create a sub-topic note. Include goals like “Adopt a Balanced Diet.”

4. **Set Goals and Action Plans**:
   - In the `Nutrition` note, set goals and create action plans with steps like “Plan Weekly Meals” and “Track Caloric Intake.”

5. **Link Resources and Research**:
   - Link notes about dietary research and resources needed (e.g., meal planning apps).

6. **Monitor and Review**:
   - Regularly update monitoring notes with progress and challenges. Plan review sessions monthly to adjust goals and plans as needed.

### Conclusion

By implementing this structured framework in Obsidian, you can efficiently manage and plan any topic with precision. The combination of structured templates, linked notes, and Obsidian's powerful features will allow you to maintain an organized, dynamic, and adaptable system. This setup will help you keep track of progress, make informed decisions, and achieve your personal objectives.
