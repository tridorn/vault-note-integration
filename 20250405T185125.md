It rarely replaces a live slide pitch—rather, it complements or extends it. Think of it as the “on-demand” version of your presentation. In a **live pitch** with stakeholders physically in front of you, **slides** work best for direct pacing and interaction. But once that meeting ends:

1. **Post-Meeting Follow-Up:**  
   - You send them the link to your web pitch page. They can revisit your key points at their leisure, share it with internal colleagues or decision-makers who couldn’t attend, and get a closer look at any data or pilot details you didn’t have time to show.

2. **Pre-Meeting Primer:**  
   - Sometimes, you might provide an online pitch link ahead of a meeting so stakeholders can warm up to the idea. It sets the stage, saving you time to dive deeper in person.

3. **Targeting Different Audiences:**  
   - You’ll likely iterate your slides for each particular pitch setting—a bank vs. a corporate partner vs. an investor. Meanwhile, your **web pitch** can remain a single, thorough “universal reference” that folks can browse whenever, from any device.

4. **Ongoing Marketing Tool:**  
   - As you go beyond seed or pilot phases, you can embed your web pitch into your official website. Potential partners or future investors can discover it organically, without scheduling a call.  
   - For instance, a bank that’s heard about you from an industry contact might visit your site, see the pitch, and become intrigued enough to reach out.

5. **Evergreen Company Narrative:**  
   - Slide decks often get updated or tailored for each meeting. A web pitch can remain a central, frequently updated narrative that grows alongside your business. It’s less about immediate stand-up presenting and more about **on-demand, self-guided storytelling**.

In short, **slides for live presentation; web pitch for accessible, shareable reinforcement**. They work hand in hand:

- Live pitch first → Q&A → “Here’s a link if you want a deeper look.”  
- Or if it’s an unexpected inbound lead: “Sure, here’s our interactive pitch. Let’s set up a call once you’ve walked through it.”

It makes Veridian’s story more tangible and more enduring than a single slide deck alone.
