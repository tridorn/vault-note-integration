Alright -- then we'll build this Dubai entry plan assuming:
- You already have a small but functional German base (Mannheim) when you move -- either a UG or GmbH, a few clients/revenue streams, maybe 1--2 early-stage ventures in your "engine" portfolio.
- The German company will still operate -- for credibility in the EU, and to service EU-based clients -- but Dubai will become your operational HQ and eventual profit hub.

  

Here's the first 6--12 months in Dubai broken down step-by-step:

* * *

## Step 1 -- Pre-Move Prep in Germany (Months 0--3)

  

Goal: Have a clean German foundation that integrates smoothly with Dubai structure.

1. Incorporate & Stabilize German Entity

    - If still a UG: consider upgrading to GmbH before Dubai move for credibility and higher share capital base.

    - Ensure clean bookkeeping -- Dubai banks and free zones will request 1--2 years' financial statements.

2. Define Your IP & Service Structure

    - Decide what intellectual property (brand names, software, processes) will stay in Germany vs. be transferred to Dubai holding.

    - If planning tax optimization:

        - Germany will bill Dubai for EU-specific services.

        - Dubai will own the "core" IP and bill Germany (and other subsidiaries) for global rights.

3. Build Initial UAE Network Remotely

    - Attend Dubai business networking events online (Dubai Chamber, Dubai Future Foundation).

    - Reach out to free zone representatives for pre-approval discussions.

    - Line up 3--5 warm contacts in Dubai before landing.

## Step 2 -- First Month in Dubai

  

Goal: Get legal, physical, and network presence.

1. Choose Your Free Zone (based on your model)

    - DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Centre) → best general-purpose free zone, high credibility, office flex options.

    - DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre) → for finance, fintech, and investment activities.

    - Dubai Internet City / Dubai Silicon Oasis → for tech and digital companies.

    - All give you 100% foreign ownership and profit repatriation.

2. Incorporate UAE Entity

    - Timeline: 1--3 weeks if documents are in order.

    - Your German GmbH can own the UAE company directly -- gives corporate credibility.

    - Activities listed should be broad enough to cover incubation, holding, consulting, and investment.

3. Open UAE Bank Account

    - Emirates NBD, Mashreq, or FAB for operational.

    - Keep some funds on deposit to avoid compliance issues (min. ~$25--50k recommended for credibility).

4. Secure Residency Visa & Emirates ID

    - Comes via free zone company setup.

    - Valid for 2--3 years, renewable.

## Step 3 -- Months 2--4: Build Local Presence

  

Goal: Enter deal flow, establish credibility fast.

1. Attend Key Networking Events

    - STEP Conference (startups, tech).

    - Dubai Chamber of Commerce events.

    - Industry mixers at DIFC Gate Village.

2. Partner with Local Service Providers

    - PR agency that specializes in "launching" foreign founders in the UAE market.

    - Law firm for cross-border contracts (UAE--EU--U.S.).

3. Local Client/Partner Wins

    - Within first 90 days, secure at least one Dubai-based contract or partnership -- shows you're here for business, not just a tax address.
* * *

## Step 4 -- Months 4--6: Integrate German Base

  

Goal: Make the German--Dubai structure work for you.

1. Shift Core IP & Brand Rights to Dubai

    - Dubai entity licenses IP back to German GmbH for EU operations.

    - This starts the process of centralizing global profits in Dubai (low/no tax).

2. Cross-Border Marketing

    - Present Dubai as your "global HQ" and Germany as "European HQ" -- builds prestige with minimal operational disruption.

3. Set Up Basic U.S. Link

    - Incorporate Delaware C-Corp now or in next 6 months, even if dormant, to start building U.S. credit history and legal structure.
* * *

## Step 5 -- Months 6--12: Dubai as Growth Engine

  

Goal: Make Dubai visibly your operational capital.

1. Host an Event

    - Small founder/investor gathering under your company's name in Dubai -- seed your own local ecosystem.

2. Recruit Multinational Talent

    - Use Dubai's expat pool to hire a few key positions (sales, BD, ops).

    - Position them for Middle East, Africa, and Asia outreach.

3. Secure Government Linkages

    - Engage with Dubai Future Foundation, Ministry of Economy programs, and free zone advisory boards.

    - Build relationships with decision-makers for later city-scale projects.

## Why This Works with Your German Base

- Credibility: German company gives you EU legitimacy -- useful for closing deals with European clients while in Dubai.
- Tax Efficiency: Over time, profits flow to Dubai, where you pay minimal corporate tax.
- Scalability: Dubai entity can open subsidiaries anywhere -- Africa, Asia, U.S. -- without much red tape.

If you want, I can now map the legal-ownership flow between your German GmbH, Dubai OpCo, and future Delaware C-Corp so you see exactly how profits, IP, and control would move.

  

That's the piece that will ensure you're not just in Dubai physically, but financially structured to win globally.
