Excellent. Let’s strip it down to *structural clarity*—what must be done, in what conceptual zones, and for what exact purpose. The goal is to turn your intuition into *operational architecture*. Below is a **category-based execution framework**: each block is a functionally distinct area with its own rules, logic, and necessary outputs.

---

## **1. Actor Specification**  
**Purpose:** Define the exact behavior and responsibilities of each participant.  
**You must:**
- Identify each actor: SME, Vendor, Platform, External Verifier, Bank, Regulator.
- Define *capabilities* (what can they do), *obligations* (what must they do), and *constraints* (what they can’t do).
- Determine actor-specific *triggers*: What causes them to act?

**Output:** A responsibility matrix or “actor capability map”.

---

## **2. Artifact Definition**  
**Purpose:** Identify and structure the documents/data that move between parties.  
**You must:**
- List all key artifacts: Loan Application, Verification Report, Vendor Proposal, Green Compliance Record, etc.
- Define each artifact’s *life-cycle states* (e.g., Draft > Submitted > Verified).
- Define *who owns*, *who edits*, *who reads* each state.

**Output:** State machine diagrams per artifact.

---

## **3. Process Layering (Top-Level Flow Zones)**  
**Purpose:** Maintain logical clarity by operating in flow “domains”.  
These are correct as you've already defined:

| Zone | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| Onboarding | Register and vet actors |
| Origination | Initiate and structure intent to get a loan |
| Verification | Validate claims (impact, vendor legitimacy, etc.) |
| Submission | Assemble and submit validated dossiers |
| Decision | Bank evaluates risk and compliance |
| Disbursement | Money flows |
| Reporting | Post-loan tracking and compliance feedback |

**You must:**  
- Decompose each into sub-flows (actor-specific tasks, required artifacts, triggers).
- Tag each sub-flow with **entry and exit conditions**.

**Output:** Flow maps per zone, with artifact transitions and actor actions.

---

## **4. Protocol Mesh Mapping**  
**Purpose:** Replace linear flows with *inter-actor interaction choreography*.  
**You must:**
- Diagram all permissible communications between actors (e.g., SME requests vendor bid; verifier confirms vendor work; platform notifies bank).
- Define **what information is passed**, **when**, and **why**.
- Capture *conditional re-entries* (e.g., verifier requests resubmission).

**Output:** An interaction graph (like a sequence diagram or choreography map).

---

## **5. Governance + State Control Logic**  
**Purpose:** Prevent chaos and race conditions. Enforce orderly transitions.  
**You must:**
- For each artifact and each actor flow, define:
  - Allowed transitions
  - Transition triggers
  - Authorized agents
  - Logging/auditing rules
- Include *failure logic*: what happens on timeout, rejection, or invalid input?

**Output:** Governance rules per artifact and per actor, codified in state-transition tables.

---

## **6. Incentive and Compliance Hooks**  
**Purpose:** Make your system not just functional, but *adoptable*.  
**You must:**
- Identify leverage points for:
  - Green incentives (e.g., regulator grants based on verified reporting)
  - Bank compliance (e.g., taxonomy-aligned proof)
- Define how your platform captures, validates, and reports those elements.

**Output:** Incentive map + compliance schema (what is needed, how it’s verified, and where it flows).

---

## **7. Visualization + Internal Comprehension Tools**  
**Purpose:** Keep yourself sane and ensure others can onboard your logic.  
**You must:**
- Build:
  - **Interaction Diagrams** (actor messages, dependencies)
  - **State Diagrams** (artifact lifecycles)
  - **Zone Flows** (process domains with sub-flows)
- Use BPMN for human-intelligible diagrams, and statecharts for system logic.

**Output:** A master system architecture doc with modular visualizations.

---

### TL;DR — What to do and why:

| **Category** | **Action** | **Why It Matters** |
|--------------|------------|--------------------|
| Actors | Define what each party can/must do | Prevent ambiguity and define system borders |
| Artifacts | List and map stateful documents | Ensure data coherence and auditability |
| Top-Level Flows | Break process into zones | Structure complexity into manageable units |
| Protocol Mesh | Map communication and dependencies | Model real-world actor coordination |
| State Logic | Codify transitions and permissions | Control chaos, prevent invalid states |
| Incentive + Compliance | Embed value and viability | Drive adoption and regulatory alignment |
| Visualizations | Translate logic into visuals | Maintain internal clarity and team alignment |
