# how to handle rejections

Your question could be more precisely framed as: *"How can I better manage the emotional aftermath of rejection, despite initial efforts to apply Stoic principles, and ensure that such setbacks do not derail my mood and productivity in the future?"*

Firstly, it’s important to acknowledge that the reaction you experienced is entirely **human**. Stoicism doesn’t call for the immediate eradication of emotional responses, but rather for their **moderation** and **management** through rational thought. The fact that you initially responded with detachment is a positive sign, but the lingering emotional tug and eventual slump reveal that deeper emotional processing and a more sustained Stoic practice are necessary.

Here’s a breakdown of why this happened and how you can improve your response to future rejections:

### 1. **The Lingering Effects of Expectations**
Your initial reaction to the rejection was well-aligned with Stoic principles—you reminded yourself that your **self-worth doesn’t depend on external validation** and you briefly detached from the outcome. However, the fact that you considered the acceptance a “sure thing” likely created an underlying emotional investment that wasn’t fully addressed. This **expectation** gave the rejection more emotional weight than you may have realized.

- **Solution**: In future situations, focus on managing your **expectations** from the outset. Use *premeditatio malorum* (negative visualization) **before** the outcome, not just afterward. Imagine the possibility of rejection in advance, not to dwell on it, but to reduce its emotional sting if it happens. You might think: *"If I don’t get this position, I’ll use it as an opportunity for further growth."* By preparing your mind for all possible outcomes, you’ll lessen the blow and be more able to maintain emotional equilibrium.

### 2. **The Emotional Echo**
While you initially applied Stoic reasoning, the emotional reaction **returned later** in the day. This is natural—emotions often have a delayed effect, especially when they involve something you had emotionally invested in. In Stoicism, we’re encouraged not just to resist an initial emotional sting but to **revisit and reframe** the emotional narrative as it reappears throughout the day.

- **Solution**: Practice ongoing **emotional mindfulness**. When you notice the emotional tug returning, acknowledge it and **pause**. Ask yourself again: *What is within my control?* Then remind yourself of the earlier rational conclusion—this rejection, like all external outcomes, does not define your worth or your future. This way, you continuously reaffirm your **detachment** throughout the day and stop the emotional echo from building up.

### 3. **Allowing Space for Emotion Without Being Overwhelmed**
One challenge in applying Stoicism is the tendency to think that we must completely avoid emotional responses, such as **frustration** or **anger**. However, Stoicism does not call for emotional **numbness**—it encourages emotional **awareness** and **moderation**. The fact that you later cursed the interviewers reveals that **anger** and **resentment** were left unaddressed. Suppressing or denying these emotions often causes them to build up and return stronger.

- **Solution**: Acknowledge your **initial emotional response** openly, without judgment. You can admit to yourself: *"I feel frustrated, but this frustration is based on something outside my control."* Instead of suppressing or forcing positivity, allow the feeling to exist, and then **reframe** it. Recognize that emotional energy can be re-channeled into something constructive, like focusing on what can be learned or improved.

### 4. **Reinforcing Detachment Throughout the Day**
It’s easy to mentally let go of an event in the moment, but maintaining detachment as emotions resurface later on is the real test. Stoicism teaches that **detachment** from outcomes is not a one-time event but a continual practice.

- **Solution**: When you feel yourself slipping into negativity, remind yourself: *“This feeling is not who I am, and it does not affect my character or virtue.”* Use Stoic maxims, like **Epictetus’**: *“It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.”* This kind of repetition reinforces your mental framing and prevents you from spiraling back into emotional attachment.

### 5. **Fostering Resilience After the Initial Setback**
Your day broke down into a slump because the rejection dominated your mental and emotional space. This often happens when we allow a single event to overtake our sense of control and momentum. Stoicism teaches **resilience**—the ability to bounce back and maintain focus on virtue despite external setbacks.

- **Solution**: Cultivate **small, deliberate actions** that keep you productive after a setback. For example, after a rejection, immediately shift your focus to something within your control: improving a skill, working on a new project, or even performing a small, virtuous act. By re-engaging with your **active agency**, you remind yourself that you are still capable of moving forward, regardless of external outcomes. Productivity after a setback isn’t just about staying busy—it’s about reaffirming that your **will** and **actions** remain intact.

### 6. **Revisiting the Virtue of Courage**
Handling rejection also requires **courage**—not just the courage to face failure, but the courage to keep pursuing your goals even when things don’t go as planned. Sometimes, the sting of rejection can lead to self-doubt or hesitation in future efforts. Stoicism encourages us to practice **courage in adversity**, which means continuing to act with purpose, regardless of the outcome.

- **Solution**: After the initial rejection, reflect on the virtue of **courage**. Remind yourself that courage is not only about enduring challenges but also about continuing to pursue your goals despite setbacks. Tell yourself: *“This rejection is an opportunity to practice perseverance. I will continue to act in accordance with my goals, undeterred by this outcome.”*

### 7. **The Role of Amor Fati (Love of Fate)**
You’ve already touched on an important Stoic practice, **amor fati**—the love of fate. This principle involves embracing everything that happens, not merely accepting it, but viewing it as a necessary part of your journey. The rejection isn’t just something to detach from—it’s something to **embrace** as an opportunity for growth, resilience, and reflection.

- **Solution**: Mentally **reframe** the rejection as part of your **development**. Think: *“This is a challenge that fate has placed in my path. By embracing it, I grow stronger and more resilient.”* This shifts your mindset from one of resistance to one of **active engagement** with life’s events, turning setbacks into opportunities.

### Conclusion: How to Get Better at Handling Rejections

In future rejections, focus on:

1. **Premeditatio Malorum**: Anticipate possible setbacks in advance to reduce the emotional impact.
2. **Continuous Detachment**: When emotions re-emerge later in the day, reapply Stoic reasoning and remind yourself of what’s in your control.
3. **Acknowledge and Reframe Emotion**: Allow yourself to feel frustration, but reframe it rationally rather than suppressing it.
4. **Engage in Small Actions**: After a setback, immediately shift focus to something you can control, ensuring you stay productive and avoid a slump.
5. **Courage in Adversity**: Use the rejection as a test of your perseverance and courage.
6. **Amor Fati**: Embrace rejection as part of your growth, not just something to endure.

By practicing these steps consistently, you’ll strengthen your ability to handle setbacks without letting them derail your mood or productivity. Over time, this will lead to a deeper sense of inner resilience and emotional stability in the face of rejection.
