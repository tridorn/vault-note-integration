To refine and structure your system for readability and effective overview within Apple Reminders (while constrained by a single layer of sub-reminders), here‚Äôs how you can manage **projects**, **milestones**, **iterations**, and **tasks/deliverables** effectively:

---

### **Core Principles for Structuring Your System**

1. **One Project Reminder as the Parent Anchor**:
	- Use a single project reminder to anchor all related components (milestones, iterations, and tasks) as sub-reminders.
	- This ensures each project has a centralized location, even if it moves across lists.

2. **Categorize Components by Type in Sub-Reminders**:
	- Since there‚Äôs only one sub-reminder layer, create distinct **naming conventions** and **formats in notes** to differentiate milestones, iterations, and tasks.
	- Example:
	  - Title Prefix: `[Milestone] Complete Homepage Design`
	  - Title Prefix: `[Iteration] Homepage Wireframe`
	  - Title Prefix: `[Task] Add Images to Wireframe`

3. **Prioritize Immediate Focus**:
	- Keep only active or current iterations and tasks listed under the project. Archive or remove completed items to maintain readability.

4. **Integrate Kanban Board Logic via Lists**:
	- Use Apple Reminders lists as Kanban columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").
	- Move the **project reminder** with its sub-reminders between lists to reflect its current status.
	- This prevents individual sub-reminders from cluttering unrelated lists.

### **How To Formulate Titles and Notes**

#### **1. Naming Conventions for Sub-Reminders**

To maintain clarity and structure, use standardized prefixes for titles:

- **[Milestone]**: High-level project objectives.
  - Example: `[Milestone] Website MVP Completion by Dec. 31`
- **[Iteration]**: Weekly sprints contributing to milestones.
  - Example: `[Iteration] Core Wireframes by Dec. 11`
- **[Task]**: Specific actions with expected outcomes.
  - Example: `[Task] Draft Homepage Wireframe`
- **[Deliverable]**: Actionable steps (listed in task notes).
  - Example (in notes):

	 ```
    Expected Outcome: Usable draft of homepage wireframe.
    Deliverables:
    - Sketch homepage layout.
    - Add placeholders for text/images.
    - Annotate navigation paths.
    ```

#### **2. Use Notes for Context**

Each sub-reminder‚Äôs notes should clarify:
- **Milestones**: Define their role in the broader project and success criteria.
  - Example:

	 ```
    Goal: Website MVP Completion
    Criteria: 
    - Usable homepage, about page, and contact page.
    - Basic navigation functional.
    ```

- **Iterations**: Describe iteration goals and the tasks they encompass.
  - Example:

	 ```
    Iteration Goal: Complete core wireframes (Home, About, Contact).
    Includes Tasks:
    - Draft homepage wireframe.
    - Draft about page wireframe.
    - Draft contact page wireframe.
    ```

- **Tasks**: Include the **expected outcome** and **deliverables** to ensure precision.
  - Example:

	 ```
    Expected Outcome: Functional homepage wireframe draft.
    Deliverables:
    - Sketch homepage layout.
    - Add placeholders for text/images.
    - Annotate navigation paths.
    ```

### **Structuring Sub-Reminders for Readability**

Since you can only have one layer of sub-reminders, use **logical sequencing** and **visual separators** to differentiate components:

1. **Order Sub-Reminders**:
	- Sequence them by priority and workflow:
	  - Milestones (top-level goals for context).
	  - Active iterations (current sprint focus).
	  - Pending tasks (specific actions under iterations).
	- Example Sequence:

	  ```


 - [Milestone] Website MVP Completion by Dec. 31
	  - [Iteration] Core Wireframes by Dec. 11
	  - [Task] Draft Homepage Wireframe
	  - [Task] Draft About Page Wireframe
	  - [Task] Review Feedback

	  ```



2. **Use Visual Differentiation**:
	- Add icons or emojis to enhance readability:
	  - Milestones: ‚≠êÔ∏è or üìÖ
	  - Iterations: üîÑ or üóìÔ∏è
	  - Tasks: ‚úÖ or üìù
	- Example:

	  ```

	  ‚≠êÔ∏è [Milestone] Website MVP Completion by Dec. 31  
	  üîÑ [Iteration] Core Wireframes by Dec. 11  
	  üìù [Task] Draft Homepage Wireframe  
	  üìù [Task] Add Images to Homepage

	  ```

3. **Archive Completed Items**:
	- Regularly remove or mark completed tasks as done to prevent clutter.
	- Use the **Done** list in Apple Reminders to archive completed items while retaining a historical record.

---

### **Workflow For Managing Kanban and Sub-Reminders**

1. **Create Kanban Lists**:
	- Lists represent Kanban stages:
	  - "To Do," "In Progress," "Done."
	- Move project reminders with their sub-reminders between these lists.

2. **Track Progress with Sub-Reminders**:
	- Update sub-reminder statuses based on progress:
	  - Move completed tasks to "Done."
	  - Prioritize tasks in "In Progress."
	- Example Flow:
	  - "To Do" ‚Üí `[Milestone] Website MVP Completion by Dec. 31`
	  - "In Progress" ‚Üí `[Iteration] Core Wireframes by Dec. 11`
	  - "Done" ‚Üí `[Task] Draft Homepage Wireframe`

3. **Review Iterations Weekly**:
	- At the end of each week:
	  - Mark completed iterations and tasks as done.
	  - Create a new iteration sub-reminder under the project reminder.

4. **Minimize Active Sub-Reminders**:
	- Keep only immediate milestones, the active iteration, and its tasks listed under a project to enhance focus and reduce clutter.

### **Example For a Website Project**

#### **Project Reminder**

- **Title**: "Website Redesign"
- **Notes**:

  ```
  Goal: Deliver a functional MVP by Dec. 31.
  Milestones:
  - Website MVP Completion (Dec. 31)
  ```

#### **Sub-Reminders**

1. ‚≠êÔ∏è `[Milestone] Website MVP Completion by Dec. 31`
	- Notes: Goal and success criteria.

2. üîÑ `[Iteration] Core Wireframes by Dec. 11`
	- Notes:

	  ```

	  Goal: Complete wireframes for Home, About, Contact.  
	  Includes:
	  - [Task] Draft Homepage Wireframe
	  - [Task] Draft About Page Wireframe
	  - [Task] Draft Contact Page Wireframe

	  ```

3. üìù `[Task] Draft Homepage Wireframe`
	- Notes:

	  ```

	  Expected Outcome: Usable wireframe for homepage.  
	  Deliverables:
	  - Sketch layout.
	  - Add placeholders for text/images.
	  - Annotate navigation paths.

	  ```

### **Benefits Of This System**

1. **Clarity**: Consistent naming and visual markers make it easy to differentiate milestones, iterations, and tasks.
2. **Focus**: Active components stay visible while archived items remain accessible in "Done."
3. **Scalability**: Moving project reminders between lists ensures an overview across multiple projects.
4. **Efficiency**: Using notes for detailed context reduces the need for additional tools or layers.

By applying these adjustments, you can streamline your workflow, maintain readability, and ensure that your system remains both functional and scalable.
