# Living the life of a stoic

A more precise articulation might have been: "How ought I to conduct my life if I were to fully embrace and apply the principles of Stoicism?"

To live according to Stoicism is not simply to adopt a set of abstract beliefs but to enact a disciplined and intentional way of life, rooted in the practice of virtue, rationality, and acceptance of the natural order. Here is a guide to structuring one's life according to Stoic principles:

### **1. Prioritize Virtue Above All:**
Stoicism teaches that virtue—comprising wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance—is the only true good. All external things (health, wealth, reputation, etc.) are *indifferents*, meaning they are neither inherently good nor bad. You should strive to prioritize virtuous action in every situation, regardless of the outcomes or the approval of others. Every decision should be evaluated through the lens of whether it fosters virtue, not whether it brings pleasure or material success.

**Practical Application**: In everyday life, before acting or reacting, ask yourself: "Is this the virtuous path?" This requires deep reflection on your motivations and aligning your actions with moral excellence, even in seemingly trivial matters.

### **2. Practice the Dichotomy of Control:**
One of the most transformative Stoic practices is recognizing what is within your control and what is not. Stoicism teaches that while you cannot control external events or other people, you can always control your judgments, choices, and reactions. Cultivate a mindset that focuses on internal mastery—how you respond to the world—while letting go of anxieties about external outcomes.

**Practical Application**: When faced with challenges or adversities, remind yourself: "This is beyond my control; what I can control is my response." If you can cultivate indifference to external events and focus on governing your inner state, you will achieve serenity even amidst turmoil.

### **3. Cultivate Rational Detachment:**
Stoicism teaches that emotional disturbances arise from irrational judgments. Thus, you should strive to observe your emotions dispassionately, recognizing them as transient mental states that should be subordinate to reason. This does not mean becoming unemotional or cold, but rather developing emotional resilience by not allowing passions (such as fear, anger, or desire) to dictate your actions.

**Practical Application**: When confronted with intense emotions, pause and ask yourself: "Is my response rational? What irrational fear or desire might be driving this emotion?" By distancing yourself from these emotional impulses, you can respond calmly and thoughtfully, rather than react impulsively.

### **4. Engage in Daily Reflection:**
One of the most crucial Stoic practices is self-examination. Each evening, reflect on your actions, thoughts, and reactions throughout the day. This practice, akin to Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*, helps identify areas where you fell short of Stoic ideals and provides an opportunity to reaffirm your commitment to virtue.

**Practical Application**: Keep a journal where you reflect on your day, asking yourself: "Where did I fail to live according to reason? Did I act virtuously? What can I improve tomorrow?" Through this practice, you develop self-awareness and a continuous improvement mindset.

### **5. Embrace Fate (Amor Fati):**
Stoicism encourages acceptance of fate—the understanding that everything that happens, happens for a reason, in accordance with the rational order of the universe. Rather than merely tolerating events, you should actively embrace them, recognizing that they are necessary parts of the whole cosmic order. This is the essence of *amor fati*—the love of fate.

**Practical Application**: When unexpected or difficult events occur, remind yourself: "This is not misfortune, but part of the natural unfolding of events." By practicing this acceptance, you remove resistance to reality and find peace in aligning with the nature of the universe.

### **6. Pursue Temperance in All Things:**
Stoicism advocates for temperance, meaning moderation and self-control in all areas of life. Whether it is physical desires, ambition, or material possessions, excess is viewed as a distraction from the pursuit of virtue. To live according to nature is to live with balance and restraint, ensuring that your desires do not overtake your reason.

**Practical Application**: Be mindful of your habits and indulgences. For example, when eating or spending money, ask yourself: "Is this necessary, or am I indulging in excess?" By practicing moderation in your daily life, you cultivate discipline and reduce the risk of being enslaved by desires.

### **7. View Adversity as Opportunity:**
The Stoics believe that adversity is not something to be feared or avoided but welcomed as an opportunity for growth and the exercise of virtue. Every obstacle can become a tool for strengthening your character and deepening your understanding of Stoic principles.

**Practical Application**: When you encounter hardship, instead of lamenting your misfortune, ask: "How can I turn this into an opportunity to practice virtue? What can I learn from this situation?" This mindset transforms obstacles into stepping stones towards a more virtuous life.

### **8. Contemplate Death (Memento Mori):**
Stoicism encourages regular meditation on death, not as a morbid practice but as a way to remind oneself of the brevity and fragility of life. *Memento mori*—"remember that you will die"—is a central Stoic principle meant to foster humility and a sense of urgency in living a meaningful and virtuous life.

**Practical Application**: Each day, reflect on your mortality, not with dread but with a sense of empowerment. Ask yourself: "If this were my last day, would I be proud of how I lived?" This constant awareness of death encourages you to focus on what truly matters and not waste time on trivialities.

### **9. Serve the Common Good:**
Stoicism teaches that we are all part of a larger whole—both the human community and the natural world. Therefore, your actions should contribute to the well-being of others and the greater good. The Stoic ideal is not a life of isolation but of active engagement in society, promoting justice, kindness, and wisdom.

**Practical Application**: Consider how your actions impact others and society as a whole. In your daily life, ask: "How can I contribute to the common good? Am I acting with kindness and fairness toward others?" By viewing your role within the larger human community, you fulfill your duty as a rational, social being.

### **10. Remain Adaptable:**
While Stoicism advocates for living according to reason and principle, it also emphasizes the importance of flexibility and adaptability. The Stoics recognized that rigid attachment to any particular plan or outcome can lead to frustration and suffering. Instead, they advised that you should be ready to adjust your course in response to changing circumstances.

**Practical Application**: When your plans are disrupted, rather than feeling frustrated or defeated, remind yourself: "I will adapt to this new situation and continue acting in accordance with virtue." This ability to flow with life’s changes, while staying true to your principles, allows you to maintain peace of mind regardless of external conditions.

### **In Essence:**
Living a Stoic life involves constant practice and reflection. It is a life oriented toward rationality, virtue, and tranquility, achieved through the rejection of irrational passions and the acceptance of whatever fate brings. The Stoic does not seek to change the world, but to change his or her relationship with it—transforming every experience, whether joyous or painful, into an opportunity for moral growth.
