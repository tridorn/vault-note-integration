Don't say things like it's alright (or example with OneDrive link looks like pishing). Act the part over saying it out loud. Way more powerful

In general say less and watch more 
If answering then precise, with clarity, spirit and engergy

Always maintain neutral view, never nod or shake head. But at the same time don't disrespect or don't give full attention
