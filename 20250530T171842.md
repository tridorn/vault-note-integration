### üîß What You‚Äôre Building

You are building **Eupator** ‚Äî a **venture engine**:
A legally structured, revenue-producing system that builds, launches, and owns multiple businesses.

You start by:

* Setting up **two companies** in Germany:

  * **Eupator Holding UG** ‚Äì owns everything, extracts dividends, shields exit tax later
  * **Eupator Ventures UG** ‚Äì runs actual operations, sells services, builds products

* Launching **one high-margin, low-overhead service offering**:

  * A **Clarity Audit** for local SMEs (diagnostic of internal inefficiencies)
  * Evolves into larger **Digitalisation Projects** (SOPs, automations, dashboards)
  * All of this becomes part of your internal Ops units (AuditOps, BizOps, etc.)

Over 3 years, you will:

* Systematise these services into internal infrastructure
* Launch real standalone businesses (Tier 2)
* Exit Germany, permanently relocate to Dubai, and **minimise exit tax liability**
