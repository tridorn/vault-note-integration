"I frequently employ ChatGPT for an array of tasks, often transferring the responses to my note-taking platform, Obsidian. However, I encounter a recurring issue: I tend to avoid altering the output, either out of apprehension about accidentally removing crucial information or simply preserving it for future reference. As a result, I do not truly engage with or process the material."

This approach is problematic because it places you in a passive position. Instead of merely acting as a repository of information, a note-taking platform like Obsidian should ideally serve as a space for active synthesis and engagement. The goal should be to transform the raw content into a personal, meaningful resource.

Hereâ€™s how you can start restructuring your approach:

1. **Summarize Instead of Copying**: Rather than copy-pasting responses in full, extract key points or reformulate the insights in your own words. This will help deepen your understanding and prevent information overload.
	
2. **Active Reframing**: Each time you add an answer, ask yourself follow-up questions or add thoughts to it, reworking the knowledge to fit into the broader context of what you're working on.

3. **Obsidian Templates**: Create structured templates for different types of information (e.g., workflows, research insights). This forces you to organize content and decide what fits into each template, encouraging an active, critical approach.

By setting these frameworks, you can gain confidence in working with the information and move from a hoarder of knowledge to an active refiner.
