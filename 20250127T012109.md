# Practical Method for Invoking Virtues

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Gesture Preparation**:
	- **Hand Position**: Begin with both hands relaxed at your sides or in your lap. When ready to invoke a virtue, bring your hand up and look at it from the palm side (inside). This position allows for a clear view of all fingers and is conducive to a mindful, contemplative state.

2. **Focus on the Relevant Finger**:
	- **Visual and Physical Focus**: Identify the finger associated with the virtue group you need to invoke. For example, if you need to draw on the virtue of **Leadership**, focus on your left index finger.
	- **Touch and Tactile Feedback**: Lightly touch the finger with your thumb or the opposite hand to reinforce the connection. This physical contact can help ground you and bring your attention fully to the specific virtue.

3. **Mental Invocation**:
	- **Virtue Group and Specific Virtues**: Mentally recite or visualize the group and its associated virtues. For instance, for **Leadership** (left index finger), you might think, "Leadership: Charisma, Authority, Benevolence."
	- **Reflect on the Situation**: Consider how these virtues apply to the current situation. Ask yourself questions like, "How can I demonstrate benevolence in this scenario?" or "What authoritative action is needed right now?"

4. **Affirmation and Visualization**:
	- **Affirmation**: Silently or audibly affirm the virtue. For example, say to yourself, "I lead with charisma, authority, and benevolence."
	- **Visualization**: Visualize yourself embodying these virtues in the specific context you are facing. Imagine the positive outcomes of applying these virtues.

5. **Execution and Integration**:
	- **Action**: Implement the virtues into your actions and decisions. As you proceed, remain mindful of the virtues, allowing them to guide your behavior.
	- **Reflection**: After the situation has passed, reflect on how effectively you applied the virtues and what you might improve next time.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you are about to lead a team meeting and need to invoke Leadership.

1. **Gesture Preparation**: Sit quietly for a moment and bring your left hand into view, looking at the palm.
2. **Focus on the Relevant Finger**: Identify your left index finger and lightly touch it with your thumb.
3. **Mental Invocation**: Think, "Leadership: Charisma, Authority, Benevolence."
4. **Affirmation and Visualization**: Affirm, "I lead with charisma, authority, and benevolence." Visualize yourself guiding the meeting effectively.
5. **Execution and Integration**: Lead the meeting, consciously applying these virtues. Afterward, reflect on how you demonstrated leadership and consider any adjustments for future situations.

### Conclusion

Viewing the fingers from the palm side (inside) provides a clear and mindful approach to invoking the virtues. This method combines physical gestures with mental focus, ensuring that you can effectively access and apply the virtues in various situations. By incorporating this structured practice, you reinforce the virtues and enhance your ability to act in alignment with your highest principles.
