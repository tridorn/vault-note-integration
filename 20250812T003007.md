"Use what you know" is a good advice. That being said, I've used Rust, Go, Node.js, Java (Kotlin) and C# to deliver apis to business. The best choice by far is C# ASPNET + Entity Framework.

Amount of boilerplate is as little as in Node, except speed doesnt suffer. 

Build experience is as smooth as Go (it's nightmare in Java), but at the same time businesses logic oriented features (where Go strugles) are on par with Java and some are even better ( i.e. Linq-to-Sql, Pattern Matching). 

Async is as good as Go (miles better than in Java) . 

Span<T> and RefStruct allow optimizations that are impossible in Java, only Rust beats those. 

Source Generation better than Lombok. Just a bit worst than Rusts macro system. 

So, with C# you can start as easy as with Node, resulting code is as fast as Go, business features are better than in Java and you can even do optimizations on the level of Rust. Literally the only case when I would choose Rust is if I absolutely had to avoid Garbage Collection.

Ah, another drawback though - Microsoft are being extra evil lately :-(
