# Decision framing

Two models for structuring notes:

**Model A – Atomic-only**

* Each principle or claim is a standalone note.
* Source is metadata only; no separate file.

**Model B – Atomic + Source Dossier**

* Atomic notes plus one markdown per source, containing synthesis, bibliographic data, high-value locators, and links to derived notes.

## Trade-offs

**Retrieval**

* A: fastest for cross-topic search.
* B: useful when recalling source > concept (e.g., start with a book, navigate to linked notes).

**Cognitive mapping**

* A: enforces conceptual thinking, good for synthesis.
* B: preserves source argument flow, aids reevaluation.

**Maintenance**

* A: no duplication.
* B: minor cost (\~1–2 min per note to update dossier).

**Volume management**

* A: better for trivial sources.
* B: better for dense, recurring, or strategic sources.

**Decision support**

* A: all decision content in atomic notes.
* B: dossiers enable “review in place” of the reasoning environment.

## Recommendation

Adopt a hybrid model.

* Always use atomic notes as base unit.
* Create a source dossier only if:

  * Source yields ≥5 atomic notes, and
  * It will be reused or cited (key book, seminal paper, dataset, major meeting).

This ensures:

* Selectivity: no dossiers for throwaway material.
* Retrieval: anchors for important sources.
* Low overhead: dossiers only where ROI is high.

## Minimal dossier template

```
---
id: src-book-dunford-2019-obviously-awesome
medium: book
title: Obviously Awesome
author: April Dunford
year: 2019
---
Synthesis (~200 words)  
High-signal sections (page refs)  
Key notes (list of linked atomics)  
Decisions influenced  
Experiments spawned
```

---

## Workflow integration

1. Start with source REF thread, define kill criteria.
2. Capture → distil to atomic notes.
3. If triggers met, build dossier during synthesis.
4. Link atomic notes to dossier, and dossier to decisions/experiments.
5. When revisiting, enter either by map (concept) or dossier (source).
