# Note-Taking: Input → Process → Output

**1. Preparation (Before Engagement)**

* Define goals: what you want from the material (insights, details, connections).
* Create a structure in advance (e.g., Key Concepts, Questions, Reflections).
* Example: *“Leadership: Book X Summary”* with predefined sections.

**2. Active Capture (During Engagement)**

* Summarize in your own words; avoid verbatim copying.
* Mark unclear points (`?`, `#to_explore`) without breaking flow.
* Ask critical questions: “Why is this important? How can I apply it? What are its limits?”
* Note personal reactions; they seed later analysis.

**Example (book chapter):**

* Concept: Leaders should model behavior.
* Analysis: Supports authentic leadership.
* Question (#to\_explore): How to balance example with delegation?
* Reaction: Reminds me of Person X at AMU.

**3. Post-Processing (After Engagement)**

* Review, reorganize, and fill gaps.
* Synthesize: compress notes into distilled summaries (Feynman-style).
* Link to existing notes for context-building.
* Translate insights into actions or decisions.

**Example (lecture):**

* Summary: Decision-making must align with values, minimizing bias.
* Synthesis: Create systems to ensure objectivity.
* Action: Apply a values-based framework in AMU strategy session.
* Connections: Link to leadership and organizational culture notes.

### Context Adaptation

**Books**

* Summarize key points per chapter, add questions and reactions.
* After reading: condense into core insights, highlight applications.

**Lectures**

* Capture key ideas, not everything.
* Use your own phrasing, supplement later.
* Post-lecture: group under themes, clarify gaps.

**Podcasts/Conversations**

* Quickly jot big ideas and reactions.
* Afterward: consolidate, link, apply.
