# Cross-Medium Note-Taking Framework

## Premise

Not aesthetic notes but an evidence–synthesis pipeline. Analogue capture for cognition, digital structuring for permanence, search, and reuse. Enforce separation: raw intake → processing → distillation → synthesis.

## Architecture

### 1. Capture (Analogue-first)

* Tools: marginalia, index cards, post-its, wallboards.
* Rules: atomic units (1 idea per card), always anchor to source, avoid summarising—capture triggers and connections.

### 2. Processing (Transitional)

* Routine: transcribe at end of session/day into markdown scratchpad.
* Use immutable intake logs, no rewriting.
* Tag with metadata (#book/TheMomTest #chapter/3).

### 3. Distillation (Digital-first)

* Create concept notes (1 per idea/framework).
* Rewrite in own words, add examples/tests.
* Link via wiki-style references.
* Add “Action Hooks” for application.

### 4. Synthesis (Output)

* Weekly: review distilled notes, create 1–2 synthesis notes combining sources into frameworks/checklists/rules.
* Store in `/frameworks`.
* Attach validation criteria for testing in practice.

Tags:

* Type: #book, #article, #podcast
* Domain: #product, #sales, #ux
* Status: #raw, #distilled, #tested

## Medium Adaptations

* Analogue: index cards (atomic), colour-coded by domain; wallboards for mapping frameworks.
* Digital: markdown for durability, backlinks for synthesis.
* Hybrid: photograph wallboards, attach to concept notes.

## Routines

* Daily: analogue → digital transcription.
* Weekly: distil, review synthesis backlog.
* Monthly: prune, merge, tag tested frameworks.
* Kill rule: discard #raw notes after 30 days unprocessed.
