# Delineation of IPO Step (Condensed)

### 1. Input: Capturing the Raw Material

**Purpose:** Collect raw information from sources.
**Characteristics:** Descriptive not interpretative, concise, selective, in your own words.
**Content:**

* Summaries of ideas, concepts, theories
* Lists of facts, dates, definitions
* References to sources (page, link)
  **Examples:**
* Pomodoro: “Work 25 minutes, 5 min break”
* Deep Work: “Uninterrupted focus for demanding tasks”
* Workflow: “Five stages: prep, assessment, feedback, revision, approval”

---

### 2. Process: Engaging with the Material

**Purpose:** Analyze and interrogate input to make it meaningful.
**Characteristics:** Critical, reflective, question-driven, connective.
**Content:**

* Questions (“Why is this important? What’s missing?”)
* Reflections and insights
* Comparisons with other knowledge
* Problems, gaps, weaknesses
  **Examples:**
* Pomodoro: “25 min too short for deep writing?”
* Deep Work: “How to balance unavoidable admin?”
* Workflow: “Assessment and feedback redundant?”

### 3. Output: Synthesizing Insights and Applications

**Purpose:** Create value: conclusions, actions, next steps.
**Characteristics:** Actionable, conclusive, future-oriented.
**Content:**

* Key takeaways
* Action items (specific, measurable)
* Broader implications or reflections
  **Examples:**
* Pomodoro: “Breaks procrastination → test app for email tomorrow”
* Deep Work: “Schedule 2-hour focus blocks next week”
* Workflow: “Combine assessment and feedback → propose change at meeting”

---

### Step Relations

* Input: capture facts
* Process: analyze and connect
* Output: apply and decide

---

### Contextual Uses

* **Knowledge notes:** Input = summarize, Process = reflect, Output = synthesize
* **Workflows:** Input = describe steps, Process = analyze gaps, Output = propose improvements
* **Personal journals:** Input = record events, Process = reflect, Output = adjust habits
* **Decision-making:** Input = list facts/options, Process = weigh trade-offs, Output = decide + justify

---

### Keeping Clarity in Obsidian

* Use headers (## Input / Process / Output)
* Bullet points for brevity
* Mark questions (?) in Process
* Mark tasks (- \[ ]) in Output

---

### Conclusion

* **Input:** what source says
* **Process:** critical engagement
* **Output:** actionable or reflective value
