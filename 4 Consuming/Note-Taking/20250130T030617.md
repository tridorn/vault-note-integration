**Structured Color-Coding Strategy for Reading**

1. **Yellow (Core Ideas)**

   * Before reading: skim headings and key points.
   * During: highlight sentences that express the main idea.
   * After: add short margin notes or summaries.

2. **Green (Definitions & Terms)**

   * Highlight definitions immediately.
   * Underline repeated terms lightly.
   * Keep an alphabetical index for quick reference.

3. **Blue (Facts & Data)**

   * Highlight statistics, dates, factual details.
   * Mark margins with a simple symbol for scanning.
   * Transfer into flashcards or thematic notes for review.

4. **Pink (Analyses & Interpretations)**

   * Highlight critiques, arguments, and your own reflections.
   * At chapter end, note unresolved questions or insights.

5. **Purple (Questions & Uncertainties)**

   * Highlight unclear parts or questions, write them in the margin.
   * Revisit weekly to resolve via further reading or discussion.

**Technology Integration**
Digital readers and PDF tools can replicate this system, syncing notes across devices.
