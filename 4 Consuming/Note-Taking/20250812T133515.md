# why enums? a rational take

**Goal:** one schema for all notes, stable in shape, specialized with enums where variation exists.

**Benefits**

* Queryability: dashboards stay simple (`WHERE state.stage = "review"`).
* Interoperability: fewer keys, same queries across types.
* Evolution: add enum values without breaking templates.
* Consistency: avoids synonym drift (phase vs stage).

**Costs**

* Less expressive than richer structures.
* Migration effort when vocab changes.
* Users must know allowed values (solve with reference block).

**Rule of thumb**

* Categorical variation → enum.
* Structured variation → new object key.
* Free text → body.

## universal schema (excerpt)

* `identity.type`: enum `[note, book, paper, project, concept, meeting, experiment]`
* `content.mode`: enum `[summary, analysis, draft, build, notes]`
* `claims.items[].kind`: enum `[finding, insight, decision, hypothesis, quote_thesis]`
* `artifacts.items[].kind`: enum `[file, figure, table, deliverable, highlight]`
* `state.stage`: enum `[capture, clarify, compose, review, publish, archive]`
* `state.status`: enum `[open, blocked, waiting, done, n/a]`
* `state.priority`: enum `[low, normal, high, urgent]`

Other blocks: purpose, bounds, materials, claims, artifacts, actions, state, links, ledger.
Rich domains (e.g., bibliography) can be added as sub-objects without altering shape.

## when not to use enums

Use structured keys if fields are domain-specific (journal, ethics, methods). Keep outer schema stable.

---

## practical obsidian use

* **Reference vocab note** (with versioning).
* **Dataview snippets**:

  * Materials table.
  * Claims list with supports.
  * State chips (`Stage • Status • Priority`).
  * Next action banner.
* **Validation**: flag invalid enums.
* **Migrations**: maintain `migrations.md` with search/replace steps.
* **Defaults**: keep empty blocks to avoid conditional queries.

---

## examples

* **Book:** `type: book`, summary mode, insights + highlights.
* **Paper:** `type: paper`, add `bibliography`, analysis mode, findings + figures.
* **Project:** `type: project`, build mode, decisions + deliverables, next action.

Same schema, different values.

---

## governance

* Version schema and vocab.
* Validate with dataview.
* Migrate intentionally.

---

**Bottom line:** enums keep schema compact and universal. Use new keys only where richer structures are essential. Keep facts in meta, nuance in body.
