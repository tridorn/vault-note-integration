## 1. Index cards vs bound paper

Advantages of cards: atomic capture, easy reordering and clustering, durable handling, modular sizing and color, immediate repurposing as prompts or board items.

Bound paper drawbacks for this use: mixed topics per page, destructive extraction, sequence inertia.

Key trade-offs: bulk and storage, loss of individual cards, higher unit cost. Mitigations: disciplined culling, routine digitisation, hard limits per category.

## 2. Card system, compressed spec

Physical

* Sizes: A6 for main notes; A7 for ephemeral, links, or prompts.
* Stock: 200 gsm or higher.
* Layout: blank front; dot-grid back.
* Optional color code, used consistently:

  * White: source-derived notes
  * Yellow: self-generated concepts or strategies
  * Blue: experiments and metrics
  * Pink: questions or hypotheses

Metadata and IDs

* Top-right stable ID: YYMMDD-HHMM-TAG (example: 250814-0932-PRC).
* Bottom-left: source code aligned with your markdown source ID.
* Bottom-right: 1–3 letter quick tags for visual sorting.

Card types (minimal, map to markdown)

1. Claim
2. Principle
3. Pattern
4. Metric
5. Play
6. Counterexample
7. Question
8. Quote

Usage

* Front: the idea in one or two sentences.
* Back: evidence, context, source location, quick sketch.

Daily flow

1. Capture one idea per card, assign provisional ID immediately.
2. Stage new cards in a daily stack.
3. Distil same day or next morning: refine wording, confirm type, add missing metadata.
4. Link by writing cross-reference IDs on edges.
5. Digitise distilled cards by photo or scan to a markdown inbox.

Weekly integration

* Select only high-signal cards for digital encoding. Target retention at or below 30 percent.
* Transcribe to atomic markdown notes, preserve original IDs.
* Update maps or project files with new links.
* Physically file kept cards by topic with tabbed dividers; keep active projects in a portable deck.

Filing logic

* Physical: durable boxes with alphabetical or topical dividers; a carry deck for active work.
* Digital mirror: match physical dividers with /maps/; allow a card’s content to appear in multiple digital maps.

Review cadence

* Daily: distil and tag.
* Weekly: integrate, digitise, cull.
* Monthly: sample 10–15 archived cards and remove dead weight.
* Quarterly: re-cluster by current priorities; move inactive clusters to deep archive.

High-leverage practices

* Mobile capture kit: slim card wallet plus pen.
* Board integration: pin active project cards for visible flow.
* Index anchors: one “map card” per topic listing 5–10 related IDs for fast lookup.
* Experiment chains: binder-clip sequential experiment cards for rapid flipping.

Common failure points and controls

* Loss: controlled by daily digitisation and map cards that surface missing IDs.
* Overflow: enforce strict per-category limits; replacement rather than addition once limits are hit.
* Duplication: merge during distillation before digital encoding.
