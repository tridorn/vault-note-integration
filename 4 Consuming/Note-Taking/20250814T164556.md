# Architecture, condensed

Principle: analogue for cognition, digital for retrieval and recombination.

1. Capture. Handwritten first. Index cards, margins, post-its, wallboards. One thought per slip.
2. Distil. Same day. Convert slips into atomic statements with evidence and implication.
3. Encode. Markdown with strict metadata and stable IDs.
4. Link. Connect ideas across sources and projects. Maintain maps of content.
5. Rehearse. Spaced prompts only for decision-relevant notes. Archive the rest.

## Identifiers and filing

Single namespace.

* Note ID: yyyymmddhhmm-slug. Example: 20250814-pricing-fences.
* Source ID: src-type-author-year-slug. Example: src-book-dunford-2019-obviously-awesome.

Directory layout:

```
/notes/
/sources/<source-id>/{source.md, excerpts.md, claims.md}
/maps/
/projects/
/_inbox/
```

## Card types

Minimal taxonomy to cut meta-work.

* Claim, Principle, Pattern, Metric, Play, Counterexample, Question, Quote.

## Statement
Customers reveal willingness to pay through fenced offers before packaging is final.
## Evidence
Interview set A, n=8, three clusters responded to the same fence at different price points.
## Implication
Design two packages that separate high-urgency buyers without discounting core value.
## Action
Landing test: two fences, target CTR ≥ 2.5%, qualified reply rate ≥ 10%.

## Analogue workflow that scales

Deliberate, not nostalgic.

* Pre-print 100 weekly stickers with short IDs, for example PF-01 to PF-100. Sticker any card worth keeping. Write full timestamp ID during encoding.
* One idea per card. Forced split.
* Margin coding: circle claim, triangle question, square play. Enables fast sort.
* End of day: photograph keepers into digital inbox. No beautification.
* Cull rate target: keep at most 30 percent of analogue scraps.

## Distillation rules

Convert mush to decisions.

1. Paraphrase first. Quote only if wording is non-fungible.
2. Each atomic note contains statement, evidence, implication. If one is missing, do not keep it.
3. Tie every note to a decision or experiment. No action, archive cold.
4. Merge duplicates weekly. Keep the stronger evidence chain. Redirect links.

## Retrieval and reuse

Design for speed under pressure.

* Tags are a closed vocabulary in /maps/\_tags.md. Examples: strategy, pricing, segmentation, pmf, growth, experiment, analytics, ux, sales, negotiation, research, moat, ops.
* Prefer links over tags. Projects reference notes by link, not copy.
* Maintain two keystone maps: pricing, customer discovery. Add new maps only after five high-quality notes cluster.

## Review cadence

Cheap, tight loops.

* Daily, 15 minutes. Empty inbox, distil at least three cards.
* Friday, 30 minutes. Link pass, add or fix five links. Kill two weak notes.
* Monthly, 45 minutes. Promote most used notes to applied, record outcomes. Archive dead topics.

## Spaced prompts for retention

Rehearse only leverage.

* Mark 10 to 20 notes as rehearsing. Put a one-line cloze in the footer.
* Review at 2, 7, 21, 60 days. Demote notes that never influence a decision.

## Specialisation across media

Same schema, different locators.

* Books: source\_loc chX pY.
* Papers: section pY figureZ, include PDF page.
* Video or podcast: timestamp mm\:ss, transcribe only decision-relevant segments.
* Talks or meetings: agenda item, attach outcome and owner.
* Web: URL plus access date, pull excerpts, avoid full dumps.

## Operating constraints

Keep it sharp.

* Hard limit 10 kept notes per chapter or per hour of audio.
* For every five notes, specify one play and schedule it in a real project.
* Quote density below 10 percent. Paraphrase to think.
* Any note not linked within seven days returns to inbox and is eligible for deletion.

## Example per-book cycle, 3.5 days

* Day 1. Read and mark analogue, 30 to 60 slips.
* Day 2 morning. Distil to 10 atomic notes plus one dossier update. Afternoon link pass.
* Day 3. Apply one play in a live experiment. Record guardrails and outcome stub.
* Half day. Write a 200-word synthesis in the dossier. Prune three notes.

## Trade-offs

* Analogue improves ideation, adds capture overhead. Pay once, recover in synthesis speed and memory.
* Strict metadata costs seconds per note, collapses retrieval later under deadline.
* Fewer, denser notes reduce serendipity, increase decision hit rate. Correct bias for operators.

## Minimal kit

* Analogue: index cards, fine pen, weekly short-ID stickers, clipboard.
* Digital: plain text editor with strong search, git repo for versioning, snippet or script to insert front-matter scaffold and timestamp.
