**Changelog Format Recommendation**

* Use **square brackets for date/time** as the primary structuring device.
* Avoid bullet points; brackets already create order.
* Write entries in **verb-first style** for clarity and speed.

**Example:**

```
[25 Jan 2025, 05:52:32] Archived the note.  
[29 Jan 2025, 12:45:00] Added reference section.  
[30 Jan 2025, 10:10:10] Corrected typo in Section 3.
```

**Optional Enhancements**

* Insert **blank lines** between entries for easier scanning.
* Add **categories/tags** if volume grows and filtering becomes necessary:

  ```
  [25 Jan 2025, 05:52:32] (ARCHIVE) Archived the note.  
  [29 Jan 2025, 12:45:00] (CONTENT) Added reference section.  
  [30 Jan 2025, 10:10:10] (EDIT) Corrected typo in Section 3.
  ```

**Final Guidance**

* Keep format minimal: bracketed date/time + action.
* Use categories only if changelog becomes dense.
