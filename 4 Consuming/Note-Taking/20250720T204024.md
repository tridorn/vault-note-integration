# Block Taxonomy v2 (Condensed)

## 1. Design Goals

* Clear conceptual boundaries: separate identity, lifecycle, classification, relations, substance, provenance, governance, analytics, operations.
* Simple, memorable noun labels.
* Stable 1:1 mirror from YAML to body sections, numbered and append-only.
* Extension via `ext_*` namespace.
* Upgrade safety: numbers never repurposed.

## 2. Canonical Blocks (Append-only Order)

1. `core` – identity & invariants
2. `flow` – lifecycle state & commitments
3. `taxonomy` – classification (topics, tags, facets, type)
4. `links` – graph relations (broader, related, derived, supersedes, sequence)
5. `content` – summary, keywords, language, size
6. `source` – provenance (origin, refs, urls)
7. `govern` – sensitivity, retention, license, review dates
8. `metrics` – usage analytics (ephemeral)
9. `ops` – automation & pipeline flags
10. `ext_*` – domain-specific extensions

Rule: omit unused blocks entirely in YAML and body.

## 3. Field Rules (Highlights)

* `core`: uid, title, owner, timestamps, rev.
* `flow`: stage, status, project, sprint, due.
* `links`: only UIDs; no narrative.
* `content`: machine-friendly summary, never classification.
* `metrics`: rebuildable, non-essential.
* `ops`: export, embedding, lock, priority, flags.
* `ext_*`: must not duplicate semantics.

## 4. Example (Schema 2)

Canonical YAML shows mapping; body mirrors numbered blocks.

## 5. Orthogonality

* Each block exclusive (e.g., taxonomy vs links; content vs source).
* Governance vs ops: policy vs process.
* Metrics distinct: derived, disposable.

## 6. Minimal Profiles

* Capture scratch: `core`, `flow`.
* Task: `core`, `flow`, `taxonomy.type=task`.
* Evergreen concept: `core`, `flow(stage=library)`, `taxonomy`, `links`, `content`, `source`.
* Archived: only `core`, `flow(stage=archive)`.

## 7. Migration (Old → New)

* identity → core
* life → flow
* class → taxonomy
* desc → content
* src → source
* sec → govern
* meta → metrics (`referenced_by` → `backlinks`)
* auto → ops
* x\_\* → ext\_\*

## 8. Validation Highlights

* Canonical block order; no skipped numbers.
* UID regex enforced.
* Stage must match folder decade.
* `library` requires taxonomy + summary.
* `links.broader` ≤ 2.
* `archive` stage locks summary.

## 9. Extension Examples

* `ext_research`: hypothesis, variables, outcome.
* `ext_finance`: amount, currency, category.
* `ext_learning`: difficulty, mastery, review interval.

## 10. Label Choices

* Short, concrete nouns.
* Avoids ambiguity: `flow` over “life”, `govern` over “sec”, `metrics` over “meta”.

## 11. Cheat Sheet

Order: core → flow → taxonomy → links → content → source → govern → metrics → ops → ext\_\*
Mandatory: always `core`.
Library requires: core, flow, taxonomy, links (if any), content.summary, source (if external).
Archive: core + flow only.
Append-only: extensions go to `ext_*`.
