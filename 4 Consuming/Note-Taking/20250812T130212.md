# Profiles Overview

Three interchangeable YAML-driven note profiles. Each block = YAML object, mirrored as H2.

## Profile A — Comprehensive (all-terrain, projects)

Goal: for notes, research, execution. 14 blocks.

**Skeleton (abbrev.):**

```yaml
id: 2025-idea-rocket-notes
type: [note|concept|spec|research|project|task|log]
title: Rocket Notes
created: 2025-08-12
owner: me
tags: [productivity, obsidian]
---
Identity: {canonical: Rocket Notes, slug: rocket-notes, version: 0.3}
Intent: {purpose: "Capture and ship ideas quickly.", questions: ["Reduce capture friction?"], outcomes: ["Prototype plugin"]}
Lifecycle: {stage: [idea|draft|active], status: [open|blocked|done], priority: [low|med|high|urgent], start: 2025-08-12, review_cycle: P1M}
Scope: {audience: ["self","team"], domain: ["pkm"], constraints: ["local-first"]}
Context: {summary: "Short abstract", background: ["Came from sprint retro."], assumptions: ["Daily notes exist."]}
Inputs: {requirements: [], hypotheses: [], data_refs: [], stakeholders: []}
Content: {structure: [essay|checklist|spec], keypoints: [], attachments: []}
Decisions: {log: [{date: 2025-08-12, decision: "Use YAML-driven sections.", rationale: "Consistency"}]}
Work: {tasks: [{id: T1, title: "Draft schema", assignee: me, state: todo, due: 2025-08-13}], checklist: ["Ship template"]}
Connections: {links_out: [], links_in: [], breadcrumbs: [], related: []}
Taxonomy: {facets: {topic: ["pkm"], format: ["template"], effort: ["S|M|L"], time_horizon: ["today","week","quarter"]}}
Sources: {bibliography: [{title: "How to Take Smart Notes", citekey: Ahrens2017}], web: []}
Governance: {sensitivity: [public|internal|secret], license: [all-rights|cc-by|mit], retention: keep}
Metrics: {opened_count: 0, word_count: 0, time_spent_min: 0}
Operations: {export: ["pdf","html"], automations: [{name: "Daily review", cadence: P1D}], templates: {use: "profiles/comprehensive"}}
History: {created_by: me, changelog: [{2025-08-12: "Initial import"}]}
```

**H2 order:** Identity · Intent · Lifecycle · Scope · Context · Inputs · Content · Decisions · Work · Connections · Taxonomy · Sources · Governance · Metrics · Operations · History

**Why this set:** separates why (Intent), what (Scope/Content), how (Work/Decisions), where (Connections/Taxonomy), controls (Governance/Operations/Metrics). Adds Identity, Intent, Scope, Inputs, Decisions, History.

## Profile B — Lean (fast notes)

Goal: minimal load, upgradable. 6 blocks.

```yaml
Identity: {slug: ""}
Intent: {purpose: ""}
Content: {summary: "", keypoints: []}
Work: {status: [open|done], next: ""}
Connections: {related: [], breadcrumbs: []}
Sources: {refs: []}
```

## Profile C — Research / Knowledge (Zettelkasten-friendly)

Goal: emphasises claims, evidence, provenance. 12 blocks.

```yaml
Identity: {slug: "", claim: ""}
Question: {primary: "", sub: []}
Thesis: {statement: "", confidence: 0.6}
Evidence: [{id: E1, claim: "", support: for, source: Ahrens2017, quote: "", confidence: 0.7}]
Method: {approach: [lit-review|experiment], notes: ""}
Findings: []
Limitations: []
Implications: []
Replicates: {datasets: [], code: []}
Sources: {bibliography: []}
Taxonomy: {facets: {field: [], methods: [], tags: []}}
Connections: {related: [], parents: [], children: []}
```

## Migration guide (old → new)

* Flow → Work + Lifecycle + Decisions
* Taxonomy → Taxonomy (facets)
* Links → Connections
* Content → Content
* Source → Sources
* Govern → Governance
* Metrics → Metrics (expanded)
* Ops → Operations
* New: Identity, Intent, Scope, Inputs, Decisions, History

---

## Naming & Dataview tips

* snake\_case keys, arrays over strings
* small fixed enums for reliable queries
* dates: YYYY-MM-DD (timestamps with timezone)
* queryable facets in Taxonomy
