# The unified primitives (12 blocks)

A dual-purpose note model usable across projects, book notes, research, or static references. Balanced between machine-readable meta and human-readable body.

**Core principle**:

* Meta (YAML): structured, queryable, factual.
* Body (H2): narrative, interpretive, human-oriented.

## The 12 blocks

1. **identity** – what it is
2. **intent** – purpose or learning goal
3. **sources** – bibliographic references
4. **inputs** – non-bibliographic material (datasets, prompts, requirements, assets)
5. **method** – approach/steps/tools/timeline
6. **content** – main body (summary, analysis, draft)
7. **findings** – results, observations, quotes, metrics
8. **conclusions** – takeaways, claims, decisions
9. **next** – follow-ups, open questions, tasks
10. **state** – stage, status, classification, tags
11. **ledger** – chronological change log
12. **links** – parent/child/dependency relations

## Adaptability

Blocks behave polymorphically:

| Block       | Book             | Research           | Project             |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| identity    | book entry       | paper entry        | project/experiment  |
| intent      | why read         | research questions | goal/outcome        |
| sources     | references       | bibliography       | standards/specs     |
| inputs      | outline          | datasets/code      | requirements/assets |
| method      | reading strategy | methods/plan       | project plan        |
| content     | summary          | analysis           | design/notes        |
| findings    | quotes           | results            | measurements        |
| conclusions | takeaways        | interpretation     | decision            |
| next        | related books    | replications       | next task           |
| state       | stage=done       | stage=review       | stage-based         |
| ledger      | revisions        | versioned notes    | logs/iterations     |
| links       | themes           | related studies    | dependencies        |

Same schema, no special templates.

## Canonical YAML schema (abridged)

* **identity**: {id, title, type, owner}
* **intent**: {purpose, questions, outcome}
* **sources**: \[{id, title, author, year, doi|isbn, url}]
* **inputs**: datasets, requirements, prompts, assets
* **method**: {approach, steps, tools, when}
* **content**: {mode, template}
* **findings**: statements, quotes, artifacts, metrics
* **conclusions**: claims, decision, rationale
* **next**: action, owner, due, backlog
* **state**: {stage, status, project, tags, priority, created, updated}
* **ledger**: \[{ts, event, who, note}]
* **links**: parent, children, depends\_on, related

## Matching body outline

Each block mirrored in H2 for prose. Meta stays factual, body carries meaning.

---

## Rationale

* **Universality**: every artifact needs identity, purpose, material, method, body, evidence, conclusions, closure, governance, connections.
* **Separation**: bibliographic vs. non-bib inputs stay distinct.
* **Dual-side clarity**: facts in Meta; narrative in Body.
* **Static-friendly**: optional method/next/state/ledger.
* **Action-capable**: governance fields scale with live projects.
* **Queryable**: structured meta powers dashboards and summaries.
