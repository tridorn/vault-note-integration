# 6-Step Analogue-to-Markdown Notes Workflow

1. **Finish reading, mark for extraction**

   * After the last chapter, scan notes.
   * Select only the top 20–30% insights.
   * Use symbols: @ experiment, \$ monetisation, ? open question, ! critical insight.

2. **State the core thesis**

   * One paragraph in your own words.
   * Clarify what problem the book solves and its impact on your decisions.

3. **Extract 3–5 takeaways**

   * Express as action rules: *If X → Y*.
   * Keep specific, tied to leverage points.

4. **Create the Markdown file**
   Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD_Title_Author.md`
   Template:

   ```
   # Title — Author
   ## Date Finished: YYYY-MM-DD
   ## Core Thesis
   …
   ## 3–5 Takeaways
   - …
   ## Key Concepts
   ### Concept
   Summary + implications + action.
   ## Actions / Experiments
   - …
   ## Tags
   #tag1 #tag2 #tag3
   ```

   Limit: <1,000 words.

5. **Spawn concept files**

   * For reusable ideas, create `/concepts/` entries.
   * Link back to the book, tag consistently.

6. **Link and consolidate weekly**

   * Review `/concepts/`, connect related ideas.
   * Update thematic indexes (e.g. Pricing.md).
   * Archive analogue notes in `/raw_notes/` with matching filenames.
