Your question should have been framed with decisive scope: _"Specify the minimum-viable technology stack that operationalises the canonical workspace model--covering storage, versioning, access control, and automation--without bloating the organisation."_

## Implementation Architecture -- _one spine, three satellites_

| Layer | Mandate | Recommended Tool Class | Rationale | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Authoritative Spine** | Immutable artefacts (`MasterContent`, `InterfaceContract`, `DecisionLog`, `MetricMap`, `RiskSheet`, `ProcessCard`) | **Git-based DVCS**(GitHub Enterprise, GitLab EE, or Azure DevOps) | • Native version control, branching → perfect for Mission-branch model• Signed commits → audit trail• CI hooks enforce naming + schema linting• Fine-grained RBAC maps to units• Markdown/YAML/CSV render natively | 
| **Binary Satellite** | Large assets in Shared-Library (design tokens, media, binaries) | **Object Storage + LFS** (S3-compatible bucket with Git LFS or Artifactory) | • Keeps Git repo slim• SHA-addressed blobs shareable across Projects• Access keyed to same IAM scheme | 
| **Collaboration Satellite** | Discussion threads, decisions in flight, Intel alerts | **Asynchronous chat + issue tracker**(Slack/Teams + Git Issues) | • Thread links stored in DecisionLog rows• @mentions trigger CI robots for missing artefacts | 
| **Visualisation Satellite** | Dashboards for Metrics, Risk heat-maps | **BI layer over Git-mirrored SQL**(Metabase / Grafana / PowerBI) | • Read-only; pulls from repo mirror hourly• No duplicate data entry | 

_Everything else (email, instant video, personal notes) is peripheral and optional._

### Why **not** Google Drive / SharePoint / Notion as the spine?

| Criterion | Git-based DVCS | Workspace Suites | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Branch-per-Mission isolation | Native | Impossible without cloning silos | 
| Immutable commit lineage | By design | Editable retroactively | 
| CI enforcement (lint, tests) | Hook-ready | Add-on kludges | 
| Text diff/merge at scale | Millisecond | Painful for binary-heavy docs | 
| Offline-first | Local clone | Browser reliance | 

Suites remain useful--but only as _views_, never as the system of record.

### Governance Enforcement

1. **Pre-Commit Hooks** -- reject artefacts not in approved formats or without required metadata fields.

2. **Branch Protection** -- only Mission Commanders can merge Mission branches into Project mainline.

3. **Robot Auditor** -- nightly bot ensures every open Sprint has updated `MasterContent`; flags FO on lapse.

4. **Immutable Main** -- force-push disabled; Council changes require signed tags.

### Security & Access

| Unit | Permission Scope (Git) | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Strategic Council | Read across org; merge to doctrine repo only | 
| SO Staff | Write to doctrine + Campaign charters | 
| Program Directors | Write to Project repos in their Program | 
| Mission Commanders | Create/merge Mission branches inside their Project | 
| Field Officers | Review + comment everywhere; no write | 
| Support Divisions | Read; separate write to Shared-Library binaries | 
| IH Analysts | Write SignalBriefs in Intel repo | 

RBAC maps one-to-one with organisational authority--no shadow admins.

### Migration Path

1. **Prototype**: spin up isolated GitLab EE instance; run one live Project against it for 6 weeks.

2. **Automate**: add CI lint rules and GitLab CI job for DecisionLog mirroring.

3. **Cut-over**: freeze legacy folders, import into repos, enforce commit-based work.

4. **Expand**: attach BI dashboard; deprecate redundant Drive folders.

Cost: low six-figure annual for enterprise license + object storage; trivial versus governance failure.

**Decision**: Adopt a Git-centred backbone. Everything else remains optional embellishment--never the source of truth.
