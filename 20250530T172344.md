### Viability Verdict

**Yes—create the “best-practice maps,” but only if each map is a lead-weapon that drives paid work.**
A static content play on “how to start a startup” drowns in noise. A surgical map that removes a cash-draining pain for an SME, then links to your paid audit or implementation offer, positions you as the solver worth paying.

## 1 Why It Works

| Benefit                         | Mechanism                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Lead magnet**                 | Owners search “ISO audit checklist”, “invoice automation”. Your map ranks and captures emails → fills AuditOps pipeline. |
| **Authority without time sink** | Markdown + template + AI summarisation = high-grade doc in hours, not days.                                              |
| **Asset re-use**                | Every client project yields a refined SOP → publish anonymised version → flywheel.                                       |
| **Cross-sell bridge**           | Each map ends with *“Need this implemented? Fixed-fee sprint → book call.”*                                              |

## 2 What to Map (Focus)

Ignore broad topics (“how to start a startup”). Target high-value, low-supply SME pains that align with your service ladder.

| Map Title (example)                        | Buyer                               | Pain Removed             | Paid Upsell                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| “Invoice-to-DATEV Automation Blueprint”    | Finance lead at 50-FTE manufacturer | 10 hrs clerical per week | Automation Sprint €4 k         |
| “GDPR-Ready Email Deletion Process”        | Geschäftsführer                     | Fine avoidance           | Blueprint Package €6 k         |
| “Recruitment Video Workflow in Under 48 h” | HR manager (craft firm)             | Talent shortage          | VisualOps subscription €2 k/mo |
| “Board-Ready KPI Dashboard in Notion”      | Owner trio                          | Weekly Excel hell        | KPI Dashboard €4 k setup       |

### Decision Rule

Deploy **three pilot maps** in the next 30 days.
If each yields ≥2 qualified calls or one €1 200 audit, scale cadence. If not, pivot topics toward sharper pains.

Execute, measure, iterate—content is an asset only when it moves cash.
