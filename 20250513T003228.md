You're now asking the right question: **what is the irreducible core of good execution** for a consultant--_not as a manager_, but as a **hands-on analyst/operator in the arena**. The goal is to eliminate abstraction, duplication, and fluff.

Let's now build a **new, refined execution flow**. One that:

- Includes only **what must happen** to produce client-grade output.
- Distinguishes between _thinking work_ and _output work_.
- Integrates the strongest pieces from **OSDC**, **CLEAR**, and **RAPT** into a single, **operator-level discipline**.
* * *

# **The IRON Execution Flow**

**I.R.O.N. = Interpret → Resolve → Operationalize → Narrate**

This is the **pure, mechanical loop for producing insights under pressure**. Every task you touch--model, deck, research, recommendation--runs through this.

* * *

## **1. INTERPRET -- What is the Real Ask?**

**Function**: Translate a vague task into a solvable question.

| What You Do | Why | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Frame a sharp **Problem Statement** | No meaningful work starts without this. | 
| Define the **Key Question (KQ)** | The one sentence you're answering, e.g., "How can we reduce cost without losing speed?" | 
| Sketch the **First-Idea Tree** | High-level MECE breakdown of the problem into components (2--3 levels deep). | 
| Identify 1--3 **Initial Hypotheses** | First stabs at what might be true. These give direction. | 

**Outputs:**

- Problem Statement
- Key Question
- Issue Tree (rough)
- Initial Hypotheses (clearly stated)

> _This is what "Orient" and "Clarify" tried to do. This is tighter and faster._

* * *

## **2. RESOLVE -- Test Hypotheses, Build Judgment**

**Function**: Prove or kill ideas fast through structured validation.

### For Each Hypothesis:

Run a **refined RAPT loop**:

| Substep | Action | Output | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Refine** | Restate hypothesis precisely. | "We believe churn is driven by onboarding dropout." | 
| **Assume** | List what must be true. | E.g., onboarding completion is low; NPS is low in week 1 | 
| **Probe** | Find exactly what proves/disproves this. | Quant: Funnel data. Qual: CSAT logs. Benchmarks. | 
| **Judge** | Decide: Is this hypothesis Validated / Rejected / Partial? | Write 1-sentence conclusion: "Churn is not onboarding-driven, but value-dropoff in week 3." | 

You may build:

- Simple Models (if quant)
- Micro-Charts (if visual)
- Bullet Logic (if qualitative)

**Outputs:**

- Validated/Killed Hypotheses
- Micro-Conclusions
- Working exhibits (charts, models, tables)

> _This merges "Drive," "Evaluate," and RAPT. Keeps the operator focused on **truth-production**, not research hoarding._

* * *

## **3. OPERATIONALIZE -- Translate Findings into Action**

**Function**: Make the conclusion usable.

| What You Do | Output | 
| ---- | ----  |
| For each micro-conclusion, answer: **"So what?"** | Impact, implication, decision trigger | 
| Cluster related conclusions into 1--2 **Strategic Moves** | Grouped under themes: Pricing, Ops, Org, etc. | 
| Sketch 1--3 **Recommendation Options** | Decision trees or scenarios | 
| If needed: Draft **Implementation Steps** | Time-based phases or simple roadmap | 

**Outputs:**

- Strategic Themes
- Clear Recommendations
- Optional: Roadmap / Execution Plan

> _This replaces "Recommend" and "Advise" from previous frameworks. Action is not a bonus--it's the point._

* * *

## **4. NARRATE -- Package and Persuade**

**Function**: Communicate with precision and authority.

| What You Do | Output | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Build slide logic: **1 slide = 1 conclusion** | Use slide titles as answers, not labels | 
| Build executive flow: **Problem → Findings → Options → Ask** | Use storytelling, not bullet-burden | 
| Draft **Talk Track** with 2--3 counterarguments pre-answered | Preempt resistance | 

**Outputs:**

- Slide Deck (title = conclusion)
- Executive Summary
- Talk Track / Q&A Prep

> _This absorbs "Communicate" and "Relay." You now speak for your thinking._

* * *

# **IRON Flow Summary**

| Phase | Core Output | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Interpret** | Problem Statement, Key Question, Hypotheses | Understand and define the problem | 
| **Resolve** | Validated/Killed Hypotheses, Evidence | Use data to attack hypotheses | 
| **Operationalize** | Recommendations, Implications | Translate findings into action | 
| **Narrate** | Slides, Summary, Talk Track | Deliver persuasive logic | 
* * *

# **IRON vs. Prior Frameworks**

| Framework | Replaced By IRON Phase | 
| ---- | ----  |
| OSDC: Orient + Structure | → Interpret | 
| OSDC: Drive + RAPT | → Resolve | 
| CLEAR: Recommend + Advise | → Operationalize | 
| OSDC/CLEAR: Communicate/Relay | → Narrate | 

* * *

This is your **cleanest execution protocol**--logically unambiguous, operationally sufficient, and minimal by design.
