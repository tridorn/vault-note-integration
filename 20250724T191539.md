**Correction**: You should have asked, _"What is the rational, strategically sequenced plan for developing, releasing, operationalising, and leveraging RW--across open-source publication, institutional adoption, and private monetisation--while maintaining structural integrity and long-term control?"_

* * *

### Executive Positioning:

You're not launching a product. You're codifying a **structural substrate**.  
Your goal is not velocity or virality, but _controlled diffusion_ of an irreversible idea--into minds, systems, and institutions.  
This demands tight compartmentalisation: clarity on what is **public**, **private**, **canonical**, **advisory**, and **monetisable**.

* * *

## 1. **Phase Architecture: Development to Diffusion**

### Phase I: _Codify the Canon_

**Objective**: Create an untouchable, foundational core--philosophically sound, logically precise, descriptively minimal.

| Action | Detail | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Define Immutable Core** | `rw-spec.md`: primitives, axioms, structure grammar, constraint logic. No tools. | 
| **Open Canonical Git Repo** | `github.com/reality-wrapper/spec` -- read-only spec, public issues, RFC model | 
| **Initial License** | Creative Commons BY-ND for the spec, no modification without governance | 
| **Publish Whitepaper** | 10--15 pages, PDF only, minimal aesthetics, pure logic | 

**Goal**: Establish intellectual authority without encouraging premature use or misinterpretation.

* * *

### Phase II: _Instrument the Model_

**Objective**: Create non-intrusive tooling that exposes the RW value _without modifying its logic._

| Tool | Function | Scope | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `.rwl` Parser | Tokeniser + validator | No runtime, no execution | 
| Visualiser | Graphs from `.rwl` files | Read-only, no write-back | 
| Translator | Adapters: JSON-LD, YAML, UML â†’ `.rwl` | One-way | 

**Distribution**: MIT/Apache 2.0 for tooling only. Spec remains restricted.

**Goal**: Build credibility, reduce barrier to inspection, not execution.

* * *

### Phase III: _Public Framing + Adoption_

**Objective**: Create entry narratives for different classes of users: individual systems thinkers, org architects, CTOs.

| Channel | Form | Function | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Blog Series** | Short, precise, each focused on one use-case (e.g. folder systems, team alignment) | Use to distribute mental model | 
| **Use-Case Git Repos** | Minimal `.rwl` models of known domains | Show applicability, not ideology | 
| **Community** | Discord/Forum | Optional, not mandatory | 

**Do not create a "movement" or branding cult.** Treat RW like LaTeX, not a productivity religion.
* * *

### Phase IV: _Institutionalise the Frame_

**Objective**: Create a foundation, define authority channels, and enable scaling of maintenance without drift.

| Org Model | Detail | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Foundation (RW.org)** | Non-profit or foundation structure, small permanent core | 
| **RFC Process** | Every change to spec goes through numbered proposals | 
| **Governance Charter** | Board of stewards, strict contribution gating | 
| **Versioning Policy** | RW Core = SemVer major only every 3 years | 

**Goal**: Prevent conceptual drift, maintain ontological clarity, preserve future leverage.

* * *

### Phase V: _Monetise via Selective Abstractions_

RW itself is **not monetisable**. The monetisable layer is the **interpretive overlay**, not the substrate.

| Vector | Offer | Principle | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Consulting** | Frame diagnosis, ontology normalisation, structural refactoring | High-margin, low-scale | 
| **Generators** | "RW-powered" workspace generators (Notion, Obsidian, GitHub folder logic) | Sell outputs, not the grammar | 
| **Auditable Systems** | RW-as-a-Map for regulated systems (finance, pharma, gov) | Certify structural clarity | 
| **Enterprise Schemas** | Tailored `.rwl` domain packs (project management, org structure) | Licensing possible | 
| **Integrators** | Partner with graph DBs, knowledge platforms | Low-friction embedding | 

RW is not the product. RW is what your product _can now visibly sit on top of_.

* * *

## 2. **Control Model**

You must preserve:

| Element | Control Level | Rationale | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **RW Core Spec** | Centralised, immutable | Must not drift or be forked into incoherence | 
| **Language (.rwl)** | Loosely versioned, governed | Enables evolution, keeps discipline | 
| **SDKs & Tools** | Fully open, community-driven | Encourage translation and adoption | 
| **Use Cases / Templates** | Public domain, unrestricted | Demonstrate breadth, invite reuse | 
| **Governance Charter** | Legally bound | Prevent ideological capture or branding distortion | 
* * *

## 3. **Sequence Checklist (Zero to Launch)**

| Step | Deadline | Outcome | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Draft v0.1 Spec | Week 1 | `rw-spec.md` with primitives, constraints | 
| Whitepaper | Week 2 | 10-page logic manifesto | 
| GitHub Repo | Week 3 | Public read-only; issues enabled | 
| Parser MVP | Week 4 | Parse `.rwl`, AST output | 
| First Use Case | Week 5 | `task-system.rwl` with SVG render | 
| Blog Launch | Week 6 | "What is RW?" followed by weekly drops | 
| Community? | Only if inbound interest passes threshold | Optional, not central | 

* * *

## Final Positioning Logic

RW must:

- _Be legible to the structural elite._
- _Be neutral to the systems it models._
- _Be incorruptible at the foundation._
- _Be easy to ignore--until needed._

You are not launching an ideology. You are making visible what was previously implicit across all systems.  
Protect that clarity above all else. Let others build noise. You own the signal.
