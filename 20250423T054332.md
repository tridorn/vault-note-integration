Perfect. You're executing a **precision exit from the German tax regime** and entering a sovereign, stateless-aligned architecture in the UAE. Below is your **German Exit Packet**—a tactical offboarding protocol to make your fiscal, legal, and operational break with Germany *airtight and audit-resilient*.

# 🧳 **GERMAN EXIT PACKET**  
## 🔻 Tactical Offboarding Framework for Sovereign Relocation to the UAE

---

## I. 🗓️ **Timeline (Optimal 90-Day Window)**

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 0 | Confirm UAE lease, Emirates ID process underway, UAE company setup launched |
| 1–2 | Book German *Abmeldung* appointment (or mail it) – deregister all addresses |
| 2–3 | Cancel German public health insurance (gesetzlich or privat) |
| 3 | Close German bank accounts and financial products |
| 4–6 | Relocate personal belongings and digital operations to UAE |
| 7 | Final Steuererklärung (tax return) for the exit year |
| 8 | File for **Wegzugsbesteuerung** valuation (if applicable) |
| 9 | Secure **UAE Tax Residency Certificate** (TRC) and store evidence trail |

---

## II. 📜 **Key Documents to Collect & File**

| Doc | Description | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **Abmeldung Bescheinigung** | Residence deregistration certificate | File at last registered Bürgeramt; backdating possible if supported by UAE lease & flight |
| **Final Steuerbescheid** | Tax ruling for exit year | May be audited 1–2 years later—retain records |
| **Wegzugsbewertung** | Shareholding valuation for exit tax | Have audited, conservative DCF valuation report ready |
| **UAE Emirates ID** | Legal proof of residency | Must pair with lease contract + DE exit |
| **UAE TRC (Tax Residency Certificate)** | Issued by UAE MoF | Minimum 183 UAE days, lease, bank account, and company |
| **Exit Memo (optional)** | Your internal file summarizing timeline and actions taken | Supports future audits or declarations |

---

## III. 💣 **Wegzugsbesteuerung (Exit Tax) Mitigation Playbook**

| You own: | Then: | Tactical move |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| ≥1% in German company (UG, GmbH, AG) | Tax due on FMV unrealised gain | Pay early if valuation low; defer 7 years *only* if you move to EEA (not UAE) |
| ≤1% or no shares | No exit tax | Proceed freely |
| IP or high retained earnings | TP issues may arise | Externalise IP before exit (license held personally), reallocate earnings via bonus or royalty flows |

✅ Submit conservative **share valuation**—use low revenue multiples, forward-looking cashflows, discount for illiquidity.  
✅ If exiting to UAE (non-EEA), you *must pay in full*—unless:
- You can **sell** before leaving
- Or restructure ownership into a foreign vehicle pre-exit

---

## IV. 🛡️ **Center-of-Life Firewall Strategy**

You must eliminate every vector that allows German tax authorities to argue that your **Lebensmittelpunkt (center of vital interests)** remains in Germany:

| Category | Kill Action |
|----------|-------------|
| **Address** | Deregister and do not keep any property or long-term lease |
| **Health insurance** | Terminate German Krankenkasse (private or statutory) |
| **Bank accounts** | Close all German accounts; switch to UAE and Swiss banks |
| **Business activity** | Cease German invoicing; all ops must route through UAE company |
| **Family** | If spouse/kids remain in Germany → risk. Relocate, or prove separation |
| **Doctors/Schools** | No German services. Proves psychological + logistical relocation |
| **Phone** | No German SIMs; get UAE/Swiss eSIMs and billing |

---

## V. 🏗️ **UAE Onboarding Stack (To Cement New Sovereignty)**

| Asset | Must-Have |
|-------|-----------|
| **Lease (Ejari) + Emirates ID** | Legal proof of tax residency |
| **UAE company** | Free Zone preferred (e.g., IFZA, DMCC, Meydan) |
| **UAE bank account** | At least 1 personal + 1 business (e.g., Wio, Emirates NBD) |
| **UAE health insurance** | Required for visa; doubles as center-of-life anchor |
| **183+ days in UAE** | Target **200+** to avoid margin-of-error audits |
| **Google Timeline / location history** | Backup proof of physical presence if challenged |

---

## VI. 📂 **Backup Vaults & Digital Audit Armor**

- Store PDFs of:
  - Flight itineraries
  - UAE lease
  - Emirates ID
  - TRC
  - Tax filings (Germany and UAE)
  - Share valuations
- Use encrypted vault (e.g. Proton Drive, Tresorit)
- Tag files by month + country for future audits
- Bonus: notarise final share valuations or tax memos

---

## VII. 🔒 Futureproofing the Exit

- **No EU property purchases** within 3 years post-exit
- **No re-entry >90 days** per calendar year into Germany
- **No German income or GmbH directorships** unless via foreign company
- Use **RAK ICC, ADGM Foundation**, or Liechtenstein Stiftung for corporate control + banking

---

## 📌 Summary: “Tax Exile” Execution Code

| Move | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| **Abmeldung filed + UAE ID** | Ends German residency |
| **Assets held abroad** | No German tax nexus |
| **UAE 183+ days/year** | Lock UAE TRC, cement new regime |
| **No family or property in DE** | No vital interest fallback |
| **Exit tax filed or avoided** | Firewall against retroactive audits |
