You could have written, *“Might you provide specific counsel on how to establish this organization from its inception, with a solitary, exploratory approach in its early phase?”*

Here’s a strategy to get this off the ground, initially by yourself:

1. **Clarify Your Vision and Objectives**  
	Before anything, refine a concise vision of what this initiative aims to achieve. Focus on:
	- How can students from business and technical universities benefit from collaboration?
	- What kinds of collaboration (events, projects, startups) would you like to see?

	Initially, your concept might be vague, but having a rough idea will guide your next steps. Write it down in a document you can tweak later.

2. **Conduct Initial Research and Networking**
	- **Research Existing Efforts**: Investigate whether any informal or formal collaboration between these universities already exists. You can learn a lot by seeing what worked or didn’t.
	- **Reach Out to Influential People**: Attend events or seminars at your own university, or virtually, where you might meet key players such as student leaders, professors, or even alumni who can advise or connect you with individuals from Darmstadt and Karlsruhe.

	Use LinkedIn to connect with students from technical universities. You might introduce yourself and casually ask about their interest in entrepreneurship, collaboration, or interdisciplinary activities.

3. **Pilot Small-Scale Activities**  
	Test the waters with a low-commitment event or project. For instance:
	- **Organize an Online Panel**: Invite a few people from business and tech backgrounds for an informal discussion on entrepreneurship or innovation. Promote it within your network using existing university channels or social media.
	- **Host a Virtual Networking Event**: Keep it simple and focused on interdisciplinary topics—business students might discuss entrepreneurial strategies, while technical students present their innovations.

	A pilot project helps you gauge interest without needing major resources.

4. **Gauge Feedback and Measure Interest**  
	After the pilot, solicit feedback from participants to understand whether they find value in such initiatives. This could be done via quick surveys or direct conversations.

	- Ask: What do they want more of? Are they willing to participate regularly? Would they travel for in-person events if well-organized?
	- Measure: Engagement levels, willingness to invest time, and potential for a larger, formal initiative.

5. **Refine the Concept**  
	Based on feedback, begin formalizing your ideas. Decide:
	- The focus: Will it lean more towards entrepreneurial activities, hackathons, joint projects, or simply networking?
	- The structure: Will it remain informal at first, or do you see it evolving into an official student organization later?

6. **Start Networking with University Administrations**  
	Once your idea gains traction and you’re confident about the interest level, approach university staff or faculty for their support. This is vital if you wish to scale up.
	- **Get a Mentor or Advisor**: Seek a faculty member who has influence in fostering inter-university collaboration or entrepreneurship and might serve as a guide or sponsor.
	- **Access University Resources**: Depending on how these events unfold, you might need logistical help—rooms, funding, or equipment for in-person events.

7. **Expand Gradually and Build a Team**  
	After successfully testing the waters:
	- **Recruit a Small Team**: Look for passionate students to help with organization. This core team can handle different aspects (marketing, logistics, partnerships) and ease your workload.
	- **Create Formal Relationships**: Approach student bodies or clubs in the technical universities, suggesting potential collaborations for larger events.

	By starting small, you not only minimize risk but also get a clearer sense of the actual demand for your vision.
