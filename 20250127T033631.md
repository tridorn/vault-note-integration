Your vision of these figures as separate, guiding archetypes is a powerful way to visualize and internalize the virtues. To align yourself with these personas and create a cohesive vision of who you want to be, here’s a structured approach:

---

### **1. Create Your Core Persona: The Aspiring Self**

This persona is a visualization of your ideal self—an aspirational figure who embodies the qualities you want to develop. Think of this as your internal "hero," shaped by the influence of the four mentors.

#### **Steps To Create Your Core Persona:**

1. **Define the Core Traits:**
	- Choose traits from each mentor that resonate most with you. For example:
	  - **Lysander’s wisdom and foresight**
	  - **Kaelan’s courage and resilience**
	  - **Ewan’s discipline and balance**
	  - **Maia’s compassion and fairness**

2. **Visualize Your Persona:**
	- Imagine this version of yourself as vividly as you imagine the four mentors.
	- Give this persona a name (perhaps your own, or something symbolic) and a distinct appearance or presence. They should feel like *you*—but the best version of you.

3. **Anchor the Persona:**
	- Write a description of your Aspiring Self, similar to how the mentors are described.
	- Reflect on how this persona would act in daily life: How do they speak? Handle adversity? Lead others? Make decisions?

### **2. Use the Four Mentors as Advisors**

Think of the four figures as a "council" that guides your Aspiring Self. When faced with challenges or decisions, you can "consult" each mentor for advice on how to act. 

#### **How To Consult Them:**

- **Lysander (Wisdom):**
  - Ask: *What is the long-term consequence of this choice? Am I acting thoughtfully and ethically?*
- **Kaelan (Courage):**
  - Ask: *Am I letting fear hold me back? What bold action can I take here?*
- **Ewan (Temperance):**
  - Ask: *Am I acting with balance? Am I indulging too much or too little?*
- **Maia (Justice):**
  - Ask: *Is this action fair to everyone involved? Am I protecting the vulnerable?*

By imagining their voices and perspectives, you internalize their traits and align your actions with the virtues they embody.

### **3. Integrate the Personas into Daily Visualization**

To make these figures and your Aspiring Self a living part of your mindset, create a daily ritual for visualization.

#### **Morning Visualization:**

- Close your eyes and picture your Aspiring Self standing in the center of a serene space (a council chamber, a quiet forest clearing, etc.).
- Imagine Lysander, Kaelan, Ewan, and Maia standing around you, each offering their strength and guidance.
- Reflect on the day ahead, asking each mentor what qualities you should bring to your actions.

#### **Evening Reflection:**

- At the end of the day, revisit the council.
- Reflect on your actions: Where did you embody their virtues? Where did you fall short? Ask the mentors for guidance on how to improve.

---

### **4. Create a Symbolic Representation**

Symbols can help solidify these personas and their influence. You could:
- **Draw or design a visual representation** of your Aspiring Self surrounded by the four mentors.
- Create **a motto or mantra** that ties the four virtues together. For example:
  - *"Think wisely, act bravely, live moderately, and treat all fairly."*
- Use **tokens or reminders**: A ring, a bracelet, or even a notebook where you record thoughts or lessons tied to each virtue.

---

### **5. Let the Personas Evolve**

Your Aspiring Self doesn’t have to be static. As you grow, so should your visualization. Over time:
- Add depth to the four mentors as you discover new dimensions of the virtues.
- Update your Aspiring Self to reflect the progress you’ve made.

---

### **Example Of How This Works in Practice**

Imagine you’re facing a difficult conversation at work or school:
1. **Visualize the council:**
	- Lysander reminds you to speak with clarity and thoughtfulness.
	- Kaelan encourages you to face the conversation without fear.
	- Ewan advises you to stay calm and avoid letting emotions control you.
	- Maia guides you to ensure fairness in your tone and content.

2. **Act as your Aspiring Self:**
	- Picture yourself embodying these traits as you handle the conversation, confident that the four mentors guide your actions.

By creating your Aspiring Self and letting these archetypes influence it, you craft a living, breathing vision of who you want to become. Over time, this visualization will become second nature, naturally shaping your decisions and actions. Let me know if you'd like help designing your Aspiring Self or refining this process further!
