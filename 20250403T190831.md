A **sleek, well-designed paper** (often called a **“one-pager,” “brief,” or “concept note”**) is a *great* idea to distribute internally at ProCredit. It ensures that:

1. **Anyone** who receives it—even those who weren’t in your meeting—can quickly grasp the vision.  
2. **Your champion** (the person you pitched) can **share it upward or laterally** with minimal friction.  
3. You look **professional** and prepared, reinforcing your credibility.

Here’s how to make it **high-impact** and easy for them to circulate:

---

## **1. Keep It Tight & Visual**

Aim for **2–3 pages**—enough to convey substance but not so long that busy executives tune out. Use **clean design** with:

- **Light brand styling** (e.g. a simple color palette, your product logo if you have one).  
- **Heading hierarchy** (H1, H2, bullet points) to break up text.  
- **Minimal** paragraphs—focus on succinct bullet points, quick “benefit” statements, and short user stories.  
- **Infographics or small diagrams** when possible (e.g., a simple flow diagram of “SME → GreenBridge → Bank”).

---

## **2. Structure: The 6-Point Layout**

You can mirror a **mini pitch** inside this doc. One recommended flow:

1. **Header / Title**  
   - Clear project name (e.g. “GreenBridge: Streamlining Green SME Loans”)  
   - Possibly a sub-tagline: “A digital aggregator for rapid, cost-effective green financing”  

2. **Executive Summary (Short)**  
   - **2–3 sentences** describing the core mission: “GreenBridge helps ProCredit accelerate SME green lending through a one-stop digital platform for scoping, financing, vendor matching, and compliance.”  

3. **The Problem & Opportunity**  
   - A few bullet points on **why** SME green financing is under-penetrated, **why** it’s complicated, and **what** opportunities exist for ProCredit’s portfolio or ESG strategy.  

4. **The Proposed Solution**  
   - Illustrate **how** your platform works in **3–4 bullet points** or a small flow chart.  
   - Emphasize **benefits**: reduce underwriting time, expand green loan volume, meet EU/regulatory targets.  

5. **Pilot Project**  
   - Outline your **initial pilot scope** (1–2 paragraphs or bullets): rooftop solar, timeframe, success metrics.  
   - Show a **simple timeline** or Gantt snippet (e.g., “Month 1: Setup, Month 2: SME signups…”).  

6. **Call to Action & Next Steps**  
   - “We’re seeking internal alignment and data on typical SME loans, so we can tailor a pilot with minimal friction.”  
   - “Contact Person: [Your Name & Email] for further discussion.”

## **3. Style Tips**

- **Use consistent headings**: e.g. “1. Executive Summary,” “2. The Problem,” etc.  
- **Color accents**: pick **one brand color** (like green for sustainability) for headings or sidebars, keep the rest minimal.  
- **Visuals**:  
  - A small **funnel diagram** or **flow chart** can say more than text. Example: “SME → [GreenBridge scoping + ROI] → ProCredit → [Loan Approved] → [Impact Verified].”  
  - If you have **screenshots** from your prototype, consider including **1–2** small ones, but not too large.

## **4. Anticipate Distribution Within ProCredit**

Your doc will likely get:

1. **Forwarded** via email to managers, colleagues, or committees.  
2. Possibly **printed** for quick desk reading.  
3. Skimmed in **2–3 minutes** by busy execs.

So, craft it to be:

- **Skimmable**: bold key phrases, minimal text blocks, bullet points.  
- **Self-Explanatory**: can they understand the gist **without** you in the room?  
- **Inviting**: your visuals and layout should encourage them to read on.

---

## **5. Add a “Data Request” Section (Optional)**

If you want to **streamline** data gathering, you can attach a **final short page** (or a separate doc) titled: “**Data Points We Need for the Pilot**.” This is basically a slim version of the checklist we discussed:

- “Average green loan size?”  
- “Current underwriting process steps?”  
- “Existing vendor partnerships?”  
- “Who in the bank is authorized to pilot digital solutions?”

This clarifies **what** you need from them in a single, easy-to-parse place. The advantage of tacking it on the same doc is it’s **right there** for them to see—no separate file needed.

---

## **6. Example Layout**

**Page 1**  
- Title + tagline  
- A single **hero** statement or short “Executive Summary” paragraph  
- A mini infographic or bullet list describing “The Problem & Opportunity”

**Page 2**  
- “Our Proposed Solution” with a **flow diagram** (SME → GreenBridge → Bank)  
- “Pilot Scope” bullet list  
- Key benefits (time saved, portfolio growth, ESG compliance)

**Page 3 (Optional)**  
- “What We Need Next” – bullet list of data or internal contacts  
- “Timeline” – pilot phases  
- “Contact Info”

This ensures your content is **readable** in 2–3 pages, max.

---

## **7. Distribution & Follow-Up**

- **Send** it as a PDF with your meeting follow-up or an introduction email, so it’s easily shareable.  
- If possible, **host** it in a cloud link (like Google Drive or Box) so you can track if it’s been viewed or updated.  
- Encourage them to **share it widely** with relevant stakeholders—“Feel free to forward this doc to colleagues who handle SME lending or green finance.”

### **Conclusion**

Producing a sleek, precisely formulated **“GreenBridge Concept Note”** or **“Project Overview”** is an excellent strategy. It solidifies your pitch, clarifies the pilot plan, and arms your ProCredit contact with a **turnkey reference** to rally internal buy-in. By keeping it short, visual, and action-oriented, you maximize the chance of it **landing** with the right people—paving the way for a pilot or more in-depth partnership discussions.
