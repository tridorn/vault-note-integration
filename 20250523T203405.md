Good. The Factory is **your power base**--the source of legitimacy, public leverage, and deep-tech access. It is **the soft shell that conceals and feeds your hard studio core**. You control the venture engine through equity and capital. The Factory lets you **control the pipeline, institutions, and grants**.

Let's break it down.

* * *

## I. **The Factory's Strategic Role**

The Factory exists to:

- **Aggregate and convert public assets** (university talent, research, IP)
- **Orchestrate founder pairing and team formation**
- **Run pre-company validation** (hackathons, sprints, EiR, MVPs)
- **Unlock public funding** (e.g. EXIST, state subsidies, EU grants)
- **Interface with institutions** (universities, city, corporates)

The Factory **does not build or own ventures**.  
It **feeds** the studio, which builds and owns them.
* * *

## II. **Legal Setup**

### **Legal Form: gGmbH (gemeinnützige GmbH)**

- Required for public grants (EXIST, state innovation programs)
- Allows formal university cooperation
- Tax-advantaged, non-profit, but can pay staff and operate programs
- Governed by a **three-block model**: Academic + Municipal + Studio (Private)

### **Ownership Model:**

- You do **not** own the Factory.
- You control **operations**, program design, and internal processes.
- You give board visibility to university and municipal stakeholders.

**This removes resistance.**  
They're not "supporting your company." They're "co-building a regional innovation institution."

* * *

## III. **Functional Architecture of the Factory**

### 1. **Program Layer (Execution)**

- **Pre-Founder Sprints**: 48--72h match + prototype
- **Validation Labs**: 6-week venture trials with selected teams
- **EiR Program**: 3-month embedded founder residency
- **Venture Thesis Circles**: Research-backed ideation tracks
- **Bridge Program**: International students or researchers landing in DE

### 2. **Institutional Integration Layer**

- Formal MoUs with:

    - Chairs of Entrepreneurship / TTO offices (KIT, TUD, Mannheim)

    - NEXT Mannheim

    - City of Mannheim Wirtschaftsförderung
- Scientific Advisory Council (non-voting): academics + industrials
- Letter of Support Bank: multiple professors, not just one

### 3. **IP & Transfer Layer**

- Pre-negotiated IP templates:

    - License or Option model

    - Royalty-free pre-Series A

    - Equity kicker for university only post-funding
- "IP-light" doctrine: Encourage software ventures, research-to-market, not patents

### 4. **Funding & Grant Interface**

- EXIST Gründerstipendium: Factory acts as application anchor
- EXIST Startup Factory (2025--2030): Apply as a regional consortium
- City innovation vouchers
- EU NextGeneration funds (if R&D-linked)
- Corporate sponsorships (sector-specific sprints or labs)
* * *

## IV. **Governance Blueprint**

| Role | Stakeholder Type | Influence | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Managing Director | You (appointed by studio) | Full operational control | 
| Supervisory Board | University (1), City (1), Studio (1) | Strategic alignment, not veto | 
| Scientific Council | Professors, corporates | Non-binding advice | 
| Advisory Fellows | Named supporters (press, leverage) | External legitimacy | 

**You hold the Managing Director role.** You control programs and day-to-day.  
The others provide visibility--not interference.

* * *

## V. **Operational Cadence**

| Quarter | Core Output | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Q1-Q2 | Pre-founder Sprint #1, EiR Batch #1 | 
| Q2-Q3 | EXIST Grant Round, MVPs, IP Optioning | 
| Q3-Q4 | EiR Batch #2, Factory Demo Day, 1 startup incorporated | 
| Q4-Q1 | EXIST follow-ons, Factory Whitepaper, Annual Review | 

Each quarter:

- 1 institutional output (e.g. sprint, EiR, IP test)
- 1 legitimising output (demo day, whitepaper, press)
- 1 handoff to Studio (company creation, investment)
* * *

## VI. **Positioning the Factory**

### For Universities:

> "We're not taking over your IP--we're making sure it sees daylight. You retain rights, we handle venture formation."

### For Public Actors:

> "This is a public-private mechanism to turn our region's research into companies. It lowers grant waste and improves return per funded project."

### For Corporates:

> "You get a front-row seat to venture creation--and the chance to sponsor sprints, invest, or co-build."

### For Students/Researchers:

> "We give you a founder path--not an internship. You co-found, not just observe."

## VII. Tactical Build Sequence

1. **Soft Launch (Now--3 Months)**

    - Form informal Working Group

    - Secure LOIs from 2--3 professors

    - Co-brand first sprint with MCEI / Q-Summit

    - Start Factory branding (neutral, institutional)

2. **Incorporation (3--6 Months)**

    - gGmbH registration

    - Define governance + operational agreements

    - Start first EiR program + EXIST prep

3. **Institutional Expansion (6--12 Months)**

    - Factory grant application (EXIST or state)

    - Co-create vertical labs with corporates

    - Public annual review/report
* * *

## VIII. Summary: What the Factory Is

- **It is your funnel.**
- **It is your grant enabler.**
- **It is your legitimacy shield.**
- **It is your institutional narrative weapon.**

You hold the keys, but let others decorate the front door.
