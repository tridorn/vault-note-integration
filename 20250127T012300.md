  - **Stoic Reflection:** Contemplate how today’s challenges are shaping you, using journaling or silent meditation.
  - **Controlled Discomfort:** Push yourself to endure something difficult daily (e.g., cold showers, prolonged focus without breaks).

---

#### **C. Execution and Focused Work (Swinging the Blade)**
