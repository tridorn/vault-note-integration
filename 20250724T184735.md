**Correction**: You should have asked, _"Propose an initial suite of foundational frameworks instantiated within the Reality Wrapper meta-architecture, each serving a distinct functional role yet interoperable by design."_

* * *

### **Initial Canon: Foundational Frameworks Governed by the Reality Wrapper**

Each of the following frameworks is a structurally minimal instantiation of the meta-grammar. They address distinct cognitive and operational domains (epistemology, action, coordination, strategy, synthesis) and can be composed, nested, or reframed as needed. Together they form a starter core--functionally orthogonal yet semantically interlinked.

* * *

## 1. **Perceptual Frame (PF)**

> _Function:_ Structure raw input into cognitively tractable entities.

**Purpose:** Defines _what exists_ for the observer. Parses undifferentiated phenomena into structured elements.

**Primitives:**

- _Signal_ → raw input
- _Distinction_ → operator that partitions signal
- _Entity_ → result of valid distinction
- _Context_ → surrounding frame that gives coherence to entity

**Governance Logic:** Epistemic minimalism. Nothing exists until distinguished.

**Interoperability:** Precedes all other systems. All downstream logic inherits its outputs.
* * *

## 2. **Intentional Stack (IS)**

> _Function:_ Encode agent-level motivation, prioritisation, and volition.

**Purpose:** Defines _why_ a system or action exists. Captures drive, utility, direction.

**Primitives:**

- _Need_ → perceived lack or asymmetry
- _Goal_ → formalised endpoint or desired configuration
- _Drive_ → directed energy toward transformation
- _Policy_ → consistent response pattern across contexts

**Governance Logic:** Directionality. All system output must trace to a motive vector.

**Interoperability:** Governs process selection in Action Systems (AS), Strategy Grids (SG), and Network Protocols (NP).
* * *

## 3. **Action System (AS)**

> _Function:_ Translate internal states into real-world transformations.

**Purpose:** Encodes executable transformations. What to do, when, under what rules.

**Primitives:**

- _Trigger_ → input condition
- _Operator_ → method or function
- _Act_ → transformation execution
- _Constraint_ → precondition and postcondition logic

**Governance Logic:** Executability. Every act must resolve to an operator and domain.

**Interoperability:** Interfaces directly with IS (intent), SG (strategy), and Coordination Protocol (CP).
* * *

## 4. **Strategy Grid (SG)**

> _Function:_ Structure multi-level, context-aware decision logic.

**Purpose:** Captures tactical, operational, and strategic coherence across time and scale.

**Primitives:**

- _Terrain_ → contextual state space
- _Position_ → current configuration
- _Vector_ → potential moves
- _Leverage Point_ → low-input, high-output intervention node

**Governance Logic:** Leverage maximisation. Output per unit input must be optimised.

**Interoperability:** Uses IS for intent, CP for execution, NP for coordination.
* * *

## 5. **Coordination Protocol (CP)**

> _Function:_ Enable synchronised, multi-agent system interaction.

**Purpose:** Ensures distributed systems do not conflict, collapse, or drift apart.

**Primitives:**

- _Agent_ → node with intent + capacity
- _Signal_ → inter-agent communication
- _Protocol_ → shared grammar for interaction
- _Alignment_ → measurable coherence of outputs

**Governance Logic:** Minimum viable coordination. Avoid deadlock, conflict, or fragmentation.

**Interoperability:** Applies to collective AS, SG. Uses IS as internal model of each node.
* * *

## 6. **Synthesis Engine (SE)**

> _Function:_ Integrate heterogeneous systems into a coherent whole.

**Purpose:** Operates as system-of-systems logic. Resolves semantic drift, structural conflict, or ontological mismatch.

**Primitives:**

- _Map_ → abstracted representation of a system
- _Bridge_ → translation layer between differing frames
- _Fold_ → logical unification of disparate outputs
- _Meta-Frame_ → shared structure above systems

**Governance Logic:** Coherence. The whole must be internally non-contradictory and externally functional.

**Interoperability:** Draws from all previous frameworks. It's the reconciling layer.
* * *

## 7. **Ontological Registry (OR)**

> _Function:_ Maintain reference identity across all systems.

**Purpose:** Serves as a persistent dictionary of all distinct entity types, frames, and logics in use.

**Primitives:**

- _Type_ → uniquely identifiable class
- _Instance_ → token of a type in a system
- _Taxonomy_ → structured relation between types
- _Annotation_ → cross-system metadata binding

**Governance Logic:** Identity consistency. If it's the same thing, it must map the same way across systems.

**Interoperability:** Binds naming and typing layers across PF, AS, SE, and others.

### Interframework Relations Overview

| Framework | Upstream Inputs | Downstream Effects | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| PF | None | IS, AS, SG | 
| IS | PF | AS, SG, CP | 
| AS | IS, PF | SG, CP | 
| SG | AS, IS | CP, SE | 
| CP | IS, AS, SG | Multi-agent AS, SG | 
| SE | SG, CP, PF | Unified systems | 
| OR | All | Typing coherence |

**Implication Chain:**

- _Perception defines what exists._
- _Intention defines what matters._
- _Action defines what is done._
- _Strategy defines what is chosen._
- _Coordination defines what is aligned._
- _Synthesis defines what is whole._
- _Ontology defines what is identical._
