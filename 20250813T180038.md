You should have phrased this as: "Design a provider-agnostic, standards-first operational architecture for the entire organisation -- spanning technical, data, and human processes -- so that all assets and activities can be managed, versioned, and audited independent of vendor lock-in."

  

Here's the rational, standards-anchored system. I'll keep tooling examples minimal and interchangeable.

* * *

## 1. Core principles

1. Standards over vendors -- Choose protocols and formats first, tools second. Migration becomes a configuration change, not a redesign.

2. Single source of truth -- Every asset has exactly one canonical location and lifecycle owner.

3. Version everything -- Code, docs, data schemas, infrastructure definitions, policies, even org charts.

4. Immutable history -- Change is append-only; corrections happen as new commits, not destructive edits.

5. Automation as interface -- Human input is explicit; everything else is machine-driven and reproducible.

6. Security and audit parity -- Same access control model and audit logging regardless of asset type.

## 2. Company-wide asset map

  

Each type of asset is stored in a medium that matches its change profile and access pattern, using open standards.

## 3. Organisational structure on the rails

  

### 3.1 Repository strategy

- Everything is a repo in the sense of a versioned root directory with metadata.

Types:

    - code-* for applications and libraries.

    - infra-* for infrastructure definitions.

    - data-* for schema and sample datasets.

    - docs-* for handbooks, policies, runbooks.

    - ops-* for scripts and operational playbooks.

    - biz-* for business processes, templates, and contracts.
- Uniform repo metadata: README, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CODEOWNERS, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Cross-link via canonical IDs: e.g., a service in code-auth refers to its infra module in infra-auth via commit SHA.

  

### 3.2 People and processes as versioned artifacts

- Org chart: stored as YAML in org-structure, with employee IDs, roles, reporting lines, and team responsibilities.
- Policies and SOPs: Markdown in docs-policies, with change proposals via pull request.
- Onboarding/offboarding: checklists in Git, triggering automated account provisioning/deprovisioning scripts.
- Meeting notes and decisions: committed to docs-decisions within 24 hours; tagged by team and linked to related issues/PRs.

  

### 3.3 Communication flows

- Slack/Matrix is ephemeral interface, not storage.

Rules:

    - Decisions and work outcomes must be promoted to a canonical, versioned location within 24h.

    - Each channel maps to a repo or domain; bots enforce linking to Git issues or PRs.
- Email: auto-archived and exported monthly in open format.
* * *

## 4. Data and binary handling

- Source of truth: object storage for large assets, Git for small/text.
- S3 API as baseline -- allows switching between AWS S3, MinIO, Ceph without change.
- Content addressing:

    - Filenames are hashes (e.g., SHA-256) or UUID + metadata file.

    - Metadata in JSON or YAML, committed to Git.
- Retention tiers:

    - Hot (current work) → Standard storage.

    - Warm (last 12 months) → Cheaper tier.

    - Cold/archive (compliance) → Glacier/deep archive, with retention policy.
* * *

## 5. Execution and automation

  

### 5.1 CI/CD as orchestrator

- CI/CD system (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.) runs from declarative config in repo.
- Pipelines are provider-agnostic:

    - Build → test → package → upload to object store → deploy via IaC.

    - Notifications to chat are standardised (JSON payload), independent of Slack.

  

### 5.2 Access control

- Git is the primary ACL anchor; storage, CI, databases reference Git group membership via SSO.
- Role-based access with least privilege.

Examples:

    - Developers: write to code repos, read object storage, no infra write.

    - Ops: write to infra repos, limited DB access.

    - HR: write to biz-* and org-* repos, no code access.
* * *

## 6. Governance and compliance

- Audit trails: All changes logged in Git or append-only event logs.
- Separation of duties: Code author ≠ deploy approver; HR data changes ≠ HR data auditors.
- Standards compliance:

    - Git commit signatures (GPG or SSH).

    - Data formats validated via schema (JSON Schema, SQL schema, ODF validator).

    - Backups exported in open formats.
* * *

## 7. Rollout approach

1. Foundational setup:

    - Self-hosted Git or cloud Git with mirrors.

    - Object store with S3 API.

    - CI/CD baseline using declarative config.

    - Postgres cluster as RDBMS backbone.

2. Asset migration:

    - Inventory current assets and map to target categories.

    - Migrate binaries to object store, commit metadata to Git.

    - Migrate docs and SOPs to Git repos.

3. Process change:

    - All work initiated as an issue in the correct repo.

    - All changes proposed via PR; no direct edits.

    - All decisions documented in docs-decisions.

4. Cultural enforcement:

    - Training: 2h intro for all staff on finding and contributing to canonical sources.

    - Slack/Email bots reminding to promote decisions to Git.

5. Ongoing discipline:

    - Quarterly audit of repos, ACLs, and adherence.

    - Annual review of standards and migration plan for vendor changes.
* * *

## 8. Consequences of adopting

- Vendor migration (e.g., AWS S3 → MinIO, GitHub → GitLab) is re-pointing endpoints; no refactor.
- Every asset has provenance, owner, and version history.
- Onboarding new staff is deterministic: one documented process, one authoritative store per domain.
- Compliance checks become queries over structured, versioned data.

If you want, I can map this into a visual organisational rail system showing flows between Git, S3, Postgres, and communication layers so you can explain it to both engineers and operations staff without ambiguity.
