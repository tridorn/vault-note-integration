Here’s a **step-by-step flow** for applying the Stoic noting system in practice in a simple and straightforward way:

---

### **Step 1: Notice**

- Pause and observe what’s happening in your mind or body.
- Ask:  
  - “What am I thinking, feeling, or doing right now?”  

---

### **Step 2: Note**

- Label what you notice using one of the **three disciplines**:
  - **Thought (Assent):**  
	 - "Judging," "Thinking," or "Believing."
  - **Feeling (Desire/Aversion):**  
	 - "Desiring," "Fearing," or "Gratitude."
  - **Action (Action):**  
	 - "Avoiding," "Reacting," or "Engaging."

### **Step 3: Reflect**

- Identify the relevant **virtue** to guide your response:  
  - **Wisdom:** “Am I seeing this clearly? Is this thought true?”  
  - **Courage:** “Am I avoiding discomfort? What action requires bravery?”  
  - **Justice:** “Am I treating others fairly? What is my duty here?”  
  - **Temperance:** “Am I showing self-control and balance?”  

---

### **Step 4: Redirect**

- Replace unhelpful thoughts, feelings, or actions with a **virtuous alternative**:
  - Thought: Replace irrational or harmful beliefs with rational ones.
  - Feeling: Accept or let go of desires, fears, or aversions.
  - Action: Take intentional steps aligned with virtue.

### **Step 5: Move On**

- Let go of the situation and refocus on the present moment.
- Ask:  
  - “What’s the next best thing I can do now?”

### **Example Of the Flow in Practice**

**Scenario:** You feel anxious about a meeting.

1. **Notice:** “I’m feeling tense and my mind is racing.”
2. **Note:** "Fearing" (Desire/Aversion).
3. **Reflect:** “Courage applies—what action requires bravery here?”
4. **Redirect:** Replace “What if I fail?” with “I’ll prepare well and trust myself.”
5. **Move On:** Focus on reviewing your materials for the meeting.
