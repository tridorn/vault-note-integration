Correction:  
A precise formulation would be "Provide inventive, strategically aligned domain names for each sphere; for the personal sphere omit my legal name to preserve privacy."

* * *

### Personal Sphere -- Low-Signature Domains

Purpose: legal, family, banking. Must read inconspicuously and resist attribution.

- **quietrelay.com** -- generic, email-friendly, hard to reverse-map.
- **cypherpost.io** -- faint crypto connotation, still neutral.
- **veilstack.net** -- privacy signal without sounding illicit.
- **lowtrace.org** -- plausible NGO fa√ßade, useful for travel.
- **cyanvault.xyz** -- unique yet forgettable; colour term masks identity.
- **elm-box.email** -- single-use alias server if you separate mail routing.

Trade-off: exotic TLDs ( .io, .xyz ) raise corporate eyebrows; stick to .com/.net if institutional trust trumps opacity.

### Public Persona -- Tristan Dornhelm

Purpose: publishing, speaking, portfolio. Needs recall and thematic resonance.

- **dornhelm.live** -- broadcasts activity; suitable for streaming or AMAs.
- **helmbrief.com** -- strategic tone, fits newsletters.
- **tristan.pub** -- minimalist, explicit publishing signal.
- **vantagehelm.com** -- implies perspective; flexible for future ventures.
- **tacticsbytristan.com** -- literal, SEO-oriented.
- **dornhelm.xyz** -- short, modern, keeps the surname anchor.

Trade-off: longer constructs aid SEO but dilute memorability; decide based on acquisition cost of the plain "tristandornhelm.com".

### Corporate Vehicle -- Eupator

Purpose: asset holding, venture studio. Must read legitimate to banks and partners.

- **eupator.com** -- canonical; acquire at premium if necessary.
- **eupatorlabs.com** -- R&D-oriented sub-brand.
- **eupatorgroup.com** -- umbrella for multiple subsidiaries.
- **eupator.global** -- jurisdiction-agnostic signalling.
- **eupatorengine.com** -- literal description of function.
- **euptr.com** -- four-letter ticker-style fallback.

Trade-off: multiple domains fragment authority; park non-core variants and redirect to the .com root.

**Next Action**  
Run bulk availability checks, secure the .com roots first, add SPF/DKIM immediately, and lock transfer at registrar level.
