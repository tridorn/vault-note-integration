That’s a great call—and you’re right to think of this as a long-term morph, not a quick hack. Since you’re using this daily, shorthand becomes a cognitive tool, not just a speed booster. So the decision should factor in ergonomics, learning curve, expressive power, and integration with how you think.

Let’s break it down rationally:

⸻

🎯 Your Goals (as stated)
	•	Free-form, expressive note-taking
	•	Capture complex ideas fast
	•	All in English
	•	Paper-based (pen + notebook)
	•	Willing to invest in learning
	•	Long-term payoff > short-term convenience

🥇 Best Long-Term System: Gregg Shorthand

Why Gregg?

Feature	Why it matters for you
Designed for speed + flow	Once learned, you can keep up with natural speech or your own thinking with ease.
Fully phonetic	You write sounds, not spelling. English irregularities vanish.
Highly expressive	You can write full thoughts, arguments, logic, not just keywords.
Built for real-time writing	Unlike systems designed for transcription (e.g. machine stenography), Gregg suits exactly your use case: live annotation of your thought process.
No special characters	Just curves, loops, and lines. No weird symbols to memorize.
Tested over 100 years	There’s tons of documentation, practice material, and it’s proven in professional environments (journalism, business, law).

Downsides?
	•	Steeper initial learning curve than systems like Teeline or Speedwriting
	•	Requires regular practice for fluency
	•	You’ll need to develop your own vocab shortcuts (it’s highly personal)

🧠 But: If you use it all day, you’ll build muscle memory incredibly fast.

🥈 Teeline (Honorable Mention)

If Gregg feels too abstract (especially at first), Teeline is a more accessible, hybrid solution. Think of it as:

The fastest shorthand system that still feels like writing English.

It uses simplified English letters (mostly consonants), drops vowels, and applies some symbol rules—but doesn’t go full phonetic.

Best for…	Not best for…
Easier startup (1–2 weeks)	Absolute maximum speed
Legibility for later review	Ultra-fast idea capture
Retaining a “Latin alphabet” feel	Expressiveness of full phrases

If you want a “minimal viable shorthand” that can evolve into something custom, Teeline is also a solid option.

⸻

⚠ Systems to Skip (For Your Case)

System	Why to skip
Pitman	Fast but uses line thickness and position = hard to write casually or reproduce reliably on paper
Stenotype (court reporting)	Requires a special keyboard + years of training; not viable for analog notebooks
Speedwriting / Alphabetic Shorthands	Easy to learn, but limited ceiling—won’t scale with your ambitions
Personal symbol system	Tempting to invent your own, but long-term recall, speed, and adaptability suffer. Reinventing the wheel is inefficient here.

🛠 Your Optimal Setup (Gregg-Based)
	1.	Start with Gregg Simplified (or Diamond Jubilee)
Modernized, easier-to-learn versions of original Gregg.
	•	Get: Gregg Shorthand Manual Simplified (PDF online)
	•	Learn: the core alphabet + word-building rules (≈2–3 weeks daily)
	2.	Use your workbook as the learning arena
	•	Apply the strokes in real notes—not as separate drills
	•	Accept messy hybrid for a few weeks (mix shorthand and longhand)
	3.	Build your own brief forms (abbreviations)
	•	e.g. “dev” for development, “res” for research, “usr” for user
	•	These are the bricks of your cognitive architecture
	4.	Add symbols for structure
Pair with Bullet Journal or Cornell-style cues:
	•	☐ task  ✧ idea  ★ insight  ☄ obstacle
	•	→ for causality, ↯ for tension, ✓ for win, etc.
	5.	Re-read + transcribe key pages weekly
Cement memory + tweak any unclear symbols

Final Verdict

If you’re truly going all-in and want the highest ceiling, fastest flow, and richest expressiveness, then:

🏆 Gregg Shorthand (Simplified or Diamond Jubilee version)

→ Best morph target for lifelong high-speed thinking on paper.

Teeline is your fallback if you want a more English-adjacent, easier-to-legibly-read system, but it maxes out lower in speed and nuance.
