You're circling the essential architectural distinction between **meta-cognition** (how we _think_) and **applied method** (how we _operate_). Let's crystallise this to remove all ambiguity:
* * *

## **I. CLEAR vs. OSDC -- Precise Delineation**

| Aspect | **CLEAR** | **OSDC** | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Purpose** | Execution framework for consulting deliverables | Mental model for effective, adaptive problem-solving | 
| **Scope** | Full-cycle consulting project anatomy | Universal reasoning engine--cross-contextual | 
| **Level** | Operational & procedural | Cognitive & tactical | 
| **Output-Focus** | What must be _produced_ to create client value | How one must _think_ to generate valid conclusions | 
| **Context Dependence** | Consulting-specific (but adaptable) | Universal (applies beyond consulting) | 
| **Phase-Based?** | Yes: 5 distinct, sequential phases | No: 4 recursive mental movements | 
| **Trigger** | Task / client mandate | Ambiguity / uncertainty / decision pressure | 
| **Form** | Externalized, trackable workflow | Internalized, repeatable thinking process | 
| **Analogy** | **Production pipeline** | **Cognitive OS** | 
* * *

## **II. Visual Model**
    
    
    Consulting Execution (CLEAR)
    ┌────────┐   ┌────────┐   ┌────────┐   ┌────────┐   ┌────────┐
    │CLARIFY│→ │LEVERAGE│→ │EVALUATE│→ │ADVISE │→ │RELAY  │
    └────────┘   └────────┘   └────────┘   └────────┘   └────────┘
         ↑             ↑            ↑            ↑           ↑
         │             │            │            │           │
         │        OSDC Loop running in each phase            │
         └───────────── COGNITIVE ENGINE ────────────────────┘
    

Each CLEAR phase is **powered by OSDC thinking**:

| **CLEAR Phase** | **OSDC Action Inside** | 
| ---- | ----  |
| CLARIFY | **Orient** (What's the real issue?) + **Structure** (Break it down) | 
| LEVERAGE | **Drive** (Test hypotheses, pull only what matters) | 
| EVALUATE | **Drive** (Model, validate logic) + **Communicate** (Start forming narrative) | 
| ADVISE | **Communicate** (Convert logic to actionable narrative) | 
| RELAY | **Communicate** (Persuade and defend insight) | 

**So yes--OSDC lives _within_ CLEAR.** It's the **cognitive layer** beneath the procedural scaffolding.
* * *

## **III. Can They Be Generalised Beyond Consulting?**

### **OSDC = Universally Applicable Problem-Solving Engine**

It can and _should_ be applied across disciplines:

- **In product management**: Feature prioritisation, market validation.
- **In policymaking**: Structuring ambiguity, testing systemic assumptions.
- **In entrepreneurship**: Business model validation, pitch preparation.
- **In academic research**: Hypothesis structuring, literature evaluation.

It is a **trans-situational decision algorithm**. The same OSDC loop runs whether you're advising a Fortune 500 or trying to fix your kitchen plumbing with unknown parts.

* * *

### **CLEAR = Consulting Execution Protocol**

CLEAR is built on the logic of professional services:

- Begins with a client-facing prompt
- Ends with a presentation or deliverable
- Moves through structured analysis

But **its logic can be adapted**:

- **In corporate strategy**: CLEAR = strategy definition process
- **In B2B SaaS**: CLEAR = client onboarding analysis
- **In startups**: CLEAR = investor deck generation logic

However, **CLEAR's bones are consulting-native**. It's a **form factor** for how consultants must move from chaos to polished delivery.
* * *

## **IV. Practical Implication for You**

- **OSDC is your mental weapon**. Always active. Every time you get a prompt, decision, request, or uncertainty--fire OSDC.
- **CLEAR is your production pipeline**. Use it to track _what needs to be produced_, in what order, to drive value.
- As you evolve beyond consulting, OSDC will scale with you. CLEAR will need adaptation.
