Reformulated: You mean: “Give a structured explanation of the general architecture of a Linux system.”

At a high level, Linux systems are stratified into distinct layers, each with a specific role, with interfaces that are mostly stable and well-defined. From bottom to top:

1. Hardware layer
	•	Physical CPU, memory, buses, storage devices, network interfaces, GPUs, sound chips, peripherals.
	•	Exposes capabilities and registers to be managed by the kernel through low-level instruction sets and I/O protocols.

2. Kernel layer
	•	The Linux kernel is a monolithic core managing hardware directly.
	•	Major subsystems:
	•	Process scheduler – decides which process/thread runs on which CPU core.
	•	Memory management – handles virtual memory, paging, and allocation.
	•	Device drivers – implement the specifics of hardware control (e.g., snd_hda_intel for your audio chipset).
	•	Filesystem layer (VFS) – presents a unified file and directory interface across disparate storage backends (ext4, XFS, NTFS, network FS).
	•	Networking stack – packet handling from physical interface to socket-level APIs.
	•	Interfaces:
	•	Syscalls – the only official entry points for user-space processes to request kernel services.
	•	/proc, /sys – pseudo-filesystems exposing runtime system and device state.

3. User-space core system
	•	Runs outside the kernel in normal memory protection mode.
	•	Init system – first process (PID 1) after kernel boot; on Fedora this is systemd. Responsible for service startup, dependency ordering, and session management.
	•	System libraries – notably glibc implementing the standard C library and wrapping syscalls for easier application use.
	•	Core utilities – shell, file management tools, text processing tools; often from GNU coreutils.
	•	Daemons – background processes providing services (e.g., sshd, pipewire, NetworkManager).

4. Middleware and compatibility layers
	•	Frameworks that standardize access to specific resources:
	•	ALSA for audio device access.
	•	X11/Wayland for graphics display.
	•	OpenGL/Vulkan for GPU acceleration.
	•	PipeWire for unified audio/video routing.
	•	These provide stable APIs/ABIs to applications, hiding low-level driver details.

5. User applications
	•	CLI tools, desktop apps, servers.
	•	Communicate with the system through syscalls (often indirectly via libraries) or via IPC with daemons.
	•	In graphical environments, run atop a display server protocol (X11 or Wayland) and a compositor.

6. Desktop environment / GUI shell (optional)
	•	GNOME, KDE, etc., which integrate the window manager, panels, system trays, and provide user-facing control over system settings.

Execution flow example (your audio case)
	•	Firefox calls PulseAudio API → PipeWire’s pipewire-pulse translates to PipeWire graph calls → PipeWire sends audio frames to ALSA library → ALSA interacts with snd_hda_intel driver in kernel → kernel programs the Intel HDA controller → controller drives the DAC in your Realtek codec → analog signal to speakers.

This hierarchy is deliberately modular. Kernel changes rarely require user-space rewrites if interfaces are stable, and user-space daemons can evolve independently of the hardware drivers below them.

If you want, I can expand this into a data-flow diagram showing the relationships and interfaces between each Linux subsystem. That would make the architecture unambiguous in one glance.
