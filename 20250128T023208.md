Refining the **Adaptive Command Matrix (ACM)** for extreme scalability requires **precisely defining leadership roles**, their responsibilities, and their relationships with each other across nested tiers of the structure. Below is a refined system that details **who leads what**, **what they do**, and **how they manage**, along with the **interplay of key components**.

---

### **1. Core Leadership Tiers in the ACM**

To maintain operational efficiency and strategic alignment at scale, the leadership structure is split into **tiers** with distinct responsibilities:

1. **Leadership Council (Strategic Command)**
   - Sets **long-term strategy**, **vision**, and **objectives**.

   - Resolves conflicts between Strategic Commands and approves large-scale resource allocation.

2. **Strategic Command Leaders (Third Tier)**
   - Lead **Strategic Commands**, which oversee multiple Task Forces and Mission Groups.
   - Serve as **regional or domain-specific leaders**, translating Leadership Council objectives into **broad operational goals**.

3. **Task Force Leaders (Second Tier)**
   - Lead **Operational Task Forces**, which are multi-functional groups formed to handle large, complex initiatives.
   - Act as **tactical coordinators** between Mission Groups within their Task Force.

4. **Mission Group Leads (First Tier)**
