Don't split in in my control or not but rather into internal and external. Visualise it like that. Helps in creating the fortress of the mind, the internal fortress .
Indeed, splitting everything in internal and external might be just the perfect view and classification of things. Also stuff like Apatheia and Anaxaria is internal, things like logos and cosmopolita is external

Don't ask in my control or not any more. Ask for internal or external. 
View the three things, assent, virtue, and action inside of the body, truly **visualise** them being inside of me

Wie auch Stoizismus teaches nur auf was in Kontrolle ist konzentrieren im gesamten Leben in der gesamten Zeit, immer jederzeit nur auf den *inneren* Faktor (wie vorher beschrieben) fokussieren

Visualise as view inside of body as internal (three things in control) and view outside of body as external.
Internal should be smiled upon, cherished and cared for
External is just indifferent. Doesn't matter at all (literally 😐)
