Here’s a **comprehensive guide** on how to work with actions in your system, focusing on what to assign upon **creation** and how to handle these assignments (e.g., priorities, flags, due dates) as tasks evolve. This approach ensures a balance of **efficiency**, **adaptability**, and **goal alignment**.

---

## **1. Assignments Upon Task Creation**

When creating a task, consider the **minimum viable inputs** to make it actionable without overloading yourself with unnecessary details.

### **What To Assign on Creation**

1. **Context** (Mandatory)
	- **What**: Assign the task to one of your **primary contexts** (`🛡️ Focus`, `⚔️ Quick Wins`, etc.).
	- **Why**: This is the backbone of your system and determines where the task will appear in your contextual workflows.
	- **How**: Ask yourself, *Where will I most likely perform this task?*

	**Example**:
	- Writing a report → `🛡️ Focus`
	- Sending an email → `⚔️ Quick Wins`
	- Scheduling a meeting → `🤝 Collaborate`

2. **Task Description** (Mandatory)
	- **What**: Write a clear, concise description of the task.
	- **Why**: A well-written task description saves time when reviewing or executing.
	- **How**: Use a simple "action + outcome" format:
	  - *"Write outline for Q1 marketing plan"* instead of *"Marketing plan"*

3. **Priority** (Optional for Simple Tasks, Mandatory for Important Tasks)
	- **What**: Assign a priority level (`🔴 High`, `🟠 Medium`, `🟡 Low`).
	- **Why**: Priority ensures you focus on tasks with the most significant impact.
	- **How**:
	  - High (`🔴`): Tasks critical to deadlines or goals.
	  - Medium (`🟠`): Important but not urgent.
	  - Low (`🟡`): Optional or "nice-to-have" tasks.

	**Rule of Thumb**:
	- Assign priority immediately if it’s **clear** (e.g., a deadline-driven task).
	- Leave priority blank for non-urgent tasks and assign it later during a review.

4. **Due Date** (Optional)
	- **What**: Assign a due date if the task is time-sensitive or part of a deadline-driven project.
	- **Why**: Ensures tasks appear in relevant time-based Smart Lists (e.g., `📅 Today`, `📆 This Week`).
	- **How**:
	  - Set precise dates for hard deadlines.
	  - Use broader dates (e.g., "end of the week") for less rigid tasks.

5. **Flag** (Optional)
	- **What**: Use a flag (`🏁`) for tasks requiring special attention or follow-up.
	- **Why**: Flags elevate the visibility of critical tasks, making them easier to track.
	- **How**:
	  - Flag tasks that need frequent review or have dependencies.

### **Example Of Initial Task Creation**

- Task: Write a blog post draft
  - Context: `🛡️ Focus`
  - Description: "Write first draft for blog post on productivity tips."
  - Priority: 🟠 Medium
  - Due Date: Next Friday
  - Flag: Not flagged (no special attention needed yet).

---

## **2. Handling Assigned Factors Later**

As tasks progress, revisit and update their details during **daily reviews**, **weekly reviews**, or as circumstances change.

### **How To Handle Specific Factors**

1. **Priorities**
	- **When to Update**:
	  - Shift priorities when the task’s urgency or importance changes.
	  - Reassess during **weekly reviews** or when new tasks are added.
	- **How to Use**:
	  - Limit high-priority tasks (`🔴`) to a manageable number daily (e.g., 3-5).
	  - Use medium (`🟠`) for ongoing work and low (`🟡`) for tasks without immediate impact.

	**Example**:
	- A task initially marked as 🟠 Medium (e.g., "Prepare meeting agenda") becomes 🔴 High if the meeting date moves up.

2. **Due Dates**
	- **When to Update**:
	  - Adjust due dates as schedules shift or priorities change.
	- **How to Use**:
	  - For overdue tasks, reschedule to a realistic date (`⏰ Overdue`).
	  - Use specific dates for tasks tied to external deadlines and general timeframes (e.g., end of the week) for less critical items.

	**Example**:
	- A missed task ("Send follow-up email") moves to tomorrow and gets re-prioritized as 🔴 High.

3. **Flags**
	- **When to Add**:
	  - Flag a task during reviews if it requires:
		 - Frequent monitoring.
		 - Follow-up or collaboration.
	- **When to Remove**:
	  - Remove the flag once the task no longer needs special attention.
	- **How to Use**:
	  - Use flags sparingly for a clean `🏁 Flagged` Smart List.

	**Example**:
	- A task initially unflagged ("Check with Sarah on report status") becomes flagged (`🏁`) after Sarah indicates she'll send the draft tomorrow.

## **3. Daily Workflow**

1. **Morning Setup**:
	- Open `📅 Today` to see all tasks due today.
	- Review `🔥 High Priority` and `🏁 Flagged` for critical items.
	- Update priorities and assign **daily focus tasks** (`🌟 Focus for Today`).

2. **During the Day**:
	- Use contextual lists (e.g., `🛡️ Focus`, `⚔️ Quick Wins`) to guide real-time task selection.
	- Reassign priorities or due dates as needed for new tasks or changing circumstances.

3. **Evening Wrap-Up**:
	- Mark off completed tasks.
	- Reassign overdue tasks (`⏰ Overdue`) or move them to tomorrow’s plan.
	- Flag any items requiring follow-up or review.

---

## **4. Weekly Review Workflow**

1. **Review Situational Lists**:
	- Check `⏰ Overdue` for unfinished tasks and reschedule.
	- Revisit `📌 No Due Date` to see if any tasks need activation.
	- Look at `👥 Waiting On` to ensure follow-ups are progressing.

2. **Adjust Priorities**:
	- Reassess tasks across all contexts.
	- Promote tasks to `🔴 High Priority` or flag (`🏁`) those needing special attention.

3. **Plan for the Week**:
	- Use `📆 This Week` to outline weekly commitments.
	- Set due dates for tasks aligned with upcoming deadlines.

4. **Align with Goals**:
	- Check `🏔️ Long-Term Goals` and `⏳ Backlog` to ensure you’re progressing toward broader objectives.

---

## **5. Key Principles**

1. **Keep It Minimal on Creation**:
	- Assign only what’s necessary to make the task actionable: Context, Description, and (optionally) Priority.

2. **Be Flexible with Assignments**:
	- Update priorities, due dates, and flags as circumstances evolve.

3. **Limit Cognitive Load**:
	- Avoid overloading tasks with unnecessary details upfront—refine them later during reviews.

4. **Leverage Smart Lists**:
	- Use `📅 Today`, `🔥 High Priority`, and `🏁 Flagged` for immediate visibility of key tasks.
	- Navigate by contexts (`🛡️ Focus`, `⚔️ Quick Wins`, etc.) during execution.

5. **Focus on Progress, Not Perfection**:
	- Regularly refine your system but prioritize doing the work over perfect organization.
