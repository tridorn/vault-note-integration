Your instinct to stop and assess your strategic trajectory is exactly what a serious founder would do. Let’s strip away the noise and look at **what your real options are**, based on your context:

---

## **Your Current Position**
- **You’re early-stage**, embedded in a student incubator setting.  
- **You have a real-world sponsor (ProCredit)** with a specific regional focus: Eastern Europe/Balkans.  
- You’re **new to fintech and startups**, meaning you want high-leverage moves but also need a path with **low terminal risk**.  
- You want to solve a **real problem**, not build noise.

Given that, let’s assess the **three primary paths** realistically open to you:

---

## **Option 1: Build a Solution *for ProCredit* (Narrow, Targeted B2B Path)**

### **What It Means:**  
You build a product that solves a pain point **specifically for ProCredit** (e.g., diaspora banking, cross-border onboarding, green SME lending). You aim to either:  
- License it to them (like a SaaS plug-in),  
- Partner long-term (as a white-label or tech provider),  
- Or **get acqui-hired / absorbed** if the solution is mission-critical.  

### **Pros:**  
- **Clear problem-owner** → your work is instantly relevant.  
- You can get **access to data, mentorship, even budget** from ProCredit.  
- A successful pilot with them is **instant credibility** (and could snowball to other banks).  
- **Low burn rate** → you don't need to raise capital aggressively.  
- **Best option if your team is strong on execution but weak on capital.**

### **Cons:**  
- You’re **locked into ProCredit’s needs and pace**—banks are slow.  
- It’s not VC-backable unless you generalize the product for others.  
- You might solve a problem **only ProCredit cares about.**  
- **Ceiling is lower** than building a standalone product.

### **Verdict:**  
If your goal is **pragmatic, high-likelihood success**, **start here.** If you build a **plug-and-play cross-border onboarding or remittance tool**, you can sell it to *ProCredit first, and others later*. This is how most real-world B2B fintechs begin.  
You’d essentially be a **specialized infrastructure fintech**, like **Tink, Plaid, or Mambu—but for Eastern Europe.**

---

## **Option 2: Build a Fintech Product *for Banks Like ProCredit* (Scalable B2B Fintech Infrastructure)**

### **What It Means:**  
You use the insight from working with ProCredit to build a **generalized, modular fintech product** that solves a **widespread pain point across regional banks** (e.g., cross-border KYC, instant remittances, green loan onboarding UX, etc.).

Your goal is to **serve multiple regional banks**—ProCredit just happens to be your wedge client.

### **Pros:**  
- It’s **VC-backable**—you’re building infrastructure that scales.  
- You can pivot based on market signals from multiple banks.  
- You remain **independent**, can grow internationally.  
- **Huge potential ceiling**: even a niche infra player in Europe is a 9-figure company.

### **Cons:**  
- You need **deep clarity on a repeatable pain point**.  
- Banks are slow-moving; **sales cycles can kill momentum**.  
- **Harder to validate early unless you deeply co-build with ProCredit or others.**  
- Requires some capital/technical backing to build robust APIs/platforms.

### **Verdict:**  
This is the **most strategic path** if you want to build a real company.  
Start by solving one clear, **urgent pain point for ProCredit**, then abstract it.  

Example: If you build a KYC-light remittance layer for ProCredit’s diaspora users—**you now have a product every bank from Moldova to Albania could use.**

---

## **Option 3: Build Your Own Fintech App / Neobank / Digital Layer (Independent B2C Fintech)**

### **What It Means:**  
You build a fintech app or banking platform that **goes directly to users**: refugees, migrants, SME owners. You bypass banks.  

Think: a cross-border neobank for Eastern Europe; a crypto-backed remittance tool for Ukraine; an SME green loan marketplace.

### **Pros:**  
- **Full freedom**: you're not tied to anyone's infrastructure.  
- Massive potential if it works → you can build Revolut-level scale.  
- You control branding, product, UX.  
- **No need to negotiate with banks.**

### **Cons:**  
- **Very high capital need**.  
- **Regulatory nightmare**: you’ll need e-money licenses, banking partners, AML tooling.  
- You compete head-on with giants: **Revolut, Wise, PaySend, etc.**  
- Takes **12–24 months to even get an MVP in market**.  
- **Very low chance of success unless you’re a repeat founder or have deep fintech backing.**

### **Verdict:**  
This is the **most ambitious and the most dangerous** path.  
Do **not** start here unless:
- You’re funded already,
- You have a strong CTO/founding team,
- And you’ve already validated the problem deeply.

This could be a **long-term evolution** if you start with Option 1 or 2 and want to go B2C later.  
But **don’t start your first ever fintech this way.** It’s how you burn out.

---

## **What Should *You* Do Right Now?**

### **Recommended Path:**
> **Start by solving a real, high-friction problem for ProCredit that could generalize to similar banks.**  

- This gets you **traction, credibility, a real user, and proof of work.**  
- You stay lean, focused, and don’t waste time building a fintech cathedral for no one.  
- If it works, you either:
   - Get a **pilot and case study**, then go sell to other banks.
   - Or abstract the product into a **fintech infra platform** that you scale.
   - Or pivot toward B2C once you deeply understand the user need.

---

## **Concrete Examples of Smart “Start Small” Ideas**
These are **problems ProCredit can’t solve fast—but you can**:

- **“Diaspora Connect”** – one-click onboarding + banking toolkit for ProCredit diaspora customers, enabling them to manage accounts in home and host country seamlessly.  
- **“Green SME Wizard”** – a tool that helps SMEs generate ESG-compliant project plans and eligibility docs for green loans.  
- **“Veteran Finance Hub”** – a platform that matches veterans with inclusive lenders, support programs, and credit tools.  
- **“KYC Light”** – an API product that helps banks onboard semi-documented displaced people faster and compliantly.
