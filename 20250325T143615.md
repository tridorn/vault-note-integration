Excellent redirection. With **UniCredit as your sponsor**, your goal should be to **solve a high-friction problem in their operating region**—ideally something that:  
- Aligns with their **strategic weaknesses** or gaps,  
- They **cannot easily solve internally** due to bureaucracy or tech inertia,  
- And gives them an **edge over other banks** in post-crisis, high-growth markets like Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, etc.

## **Problem-Focused Framing: Solving What UniCredit Can’t (Alone)**

### **Core Problem:**  
**Traditional banks like UniCredit struggle to efficiently serve displaced, underbanked, or highly mobile populations in Ukraine and the Balkans—especially in digital-native, low-cost ways.**  

---

## **Solution Space: What Can You Solve for UniCredit?**

Here are three tightly defined, **high-leverage problem spaces**, where you can build a fintech solution that **helps UniCredit do something they otherwise can't**—especially across Eastern Europe & Ukraine:

---

### **1️⃣ Modular Fintech Frontend for UniCredit’s Unbanked Strategy**  
#### **Problem:**  
UniCredit’s infrastructure isn’t built for highly mobile, often undocumented populations like Ukrainian refugees or rural Balkan citizens.  
They can’t easily onboard them, and don’t offer the **fast, mobile-first UX** that Revolut or Wise deliver.

#### **Your Solution:**  
**Build a lightweight fintech frontend (“Digital Envelope”) that plugs into UniCredit’s backend via API.**  
- Enables **mobile-first onboarding**, even with minimal documentation (eKYC).  
- Offers a **slimmed-down wallet**, cross-border transfers, and remittance tools.  
- Routes transactions through **UniCredit rails**, giving them new users & volume.  
- Use gamified UX to **pull in young, digital-native users** from rural or post-war areas.  

#### **What Problem You Solve for UniCredit:**  
- **Extends their reach into populations they structurally can’t serve.**  
- **Keeps them competitive against Revolut/N26** without building a full neobank.  
- **Boosts transaction volume and user acquisition** in underserved regions.

---

### **2️⃣ Ukraine–Balkans Remittance Gateway (with Compliance Layer)**  
#### **Problem:**  
Cross-border remittances from Ukrainian refugees to family at home are **costly, fragmented, and inefficient**—and banks like UniCredit are losing this volume to Wise, Western Union, PayPal, etc.  

#### **Your Solution:**  
**Build a compliant remittance platform tailored to Ukraine–Balkans corridors, with local integrations (cash-out, mobile wallets, bank transfers).**  
- Offer **stablecoin/fx arbitrage engine** to keep costs ultra-low.  
- Build **AML/KYC compliance tooling** designed for displaced & non-resident customers.  
- Enable **UniCredit integration via API** to handle fiat on/off ramp.

#### **What Problem You Solve for UniCredit:**  
- **Recaptures lost revenue from remittance flows** that are currently bypassing their infrastructure.  
- **Gives them corridor-specific visibility** and AML clarity they don’t have.  
- **Positions UniCredit as a regional payments leader** across Eastern Europe.  

---

### **3️⃣ SME Finance Layer for Rebuilding Ukraine**  
#### **Problem:**  
UniCredit will soon be part of **post-war rebuilding efforts**, but they are structurally cautious lenders.  
They lack visibility & risk tools to finance **Ukrainian and Balkan SMEs** rebuilding in volatile environments.  

#### **Your Solution:**  
**A “credit intelligence” layer that feeds UniCredit better SME underwriting data**—especially for displaced entrepreneurs and micro-SMEs.  
- Use **alt-data (e.g., eCommerce history, payment flows, platform activity)** to generate risk profiles.  
- Integrate a **microloan platform** on top, with UniCredit as the lender-of-record.  
- Build first in Ukraine, then expand into Serbia, Romania, etc.

#### **What Problem You Solve for UniCredit:**  
- **De-risks lending to war-affected SMEs**, giving them access to reconstruction capital.  
- Makes them **look bold and strategic**, while staying within their risk tolerance.  
- **Adds to their ESG and public impact score** (which banks care about enormously now).  

---

## **Most Rational Pick: Option 2 – Ukraine–Balkans Remittance Gateway**
**Why?**  
- It’s **immediately monetizable** (take a % of transfers).  
- UniCredit **has the backend rails but not the UX, flexibility, or compliance stack** to serve this market dynamically.  
- You **solve a bleeding problem**: money is flowing outside their ecosystem (to Wise, PayPal, crypto) because they can’t move fast.  
- You can **start lean**, prove traction in one corridor (e.g., Germany/Poland → Ukraine), and scale regionally.  

---

## **Your Framing in the Pitch:**
> _“UniCredit is losing millions in cross-border volume every year to fintechs that can serve refugee populations faster, cheaper, and more flexibly. We’re building the compliance-ready, mobile-first remittance infrastructure UniCredit needs to win these corridors back.”_
