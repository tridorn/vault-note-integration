	Innovation comes from identifying opportunities hidden in plain sight and having the courage to pursue them when others hesitate.

2. **"Leverage Is the Key to Exponential Growth."**  
	Maximize impact by utilizing resources—time, capital, people, technology—to amplify results beyond individual capabilities.

3. **"Strategic Risk Is the Catalyst for Transformation."**  
	Calculated risks are essential for breakthrough success. Assess the potential upside against the downside, and act decisively when the odds are in your favor.

	Wealth is a byproduct of creating significant value for others. Prioritize solving big problems and meeting needs on a large scale.

5. **"Build Networks, Not Just Businesses."**  
	Success is magnified through relationships. Cultivate a powerful network of allies, mentors, and partners who can open doors and provide support.

6. **"Continuous Learning Drives Continuous Earning."**  
	In a rapidly changing world, constant learning is imperative. Stay ahead by being informed, adaptable, and open to new ideas.

7. **"Time Is the Most Valuable Asset."**
