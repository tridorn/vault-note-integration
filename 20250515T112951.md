Create notes for entire timeframes that serve as overviews and are filled on-the-go. 

- Not "Directive of 2025-05-15", just "2025-05-15"
- Filled during that timeframe
- Explicitly mentioning concrete files created or filled during that timeframe
- Linking (back and forth) between other files unique to that timeframe (e.g. directives)
- Reflections of only things unique to that timeframe, other reflections deserve own note
- Create that note in Obsidian
