A more direct request would be: **"Break down points 7, 8, and 10 into simplified yet operationally effective rules--without dumbing them down, but assuming zero prior structure."**

Here is an **ELI5-style breakdown**, focused on **functionality over theory**. This is not about habits. It's system design for a high-agency life.

* * *

## **7. Sleep--Wake System (Energy Stability Infrastructure)**

**Problem if ignored**: You lose 20--40% cognitive performance due to drift, inconsistency, and poor anchoring. Most people don't realize they're underperforming because they have no baseline.

### Your System Should Include:

#### 1. **Fixed Wake Time**

- Decide a **single wake-up time** that works 6--7 days/week. Example: 06:30.
- Varying bedtime is tolerable. Varying wake time isn't. That causes jet lag symptoms.
- Use an alarm if needed, but **get natural light ASAP** (open window, go outside). This locks your body clock.

#### 2. **Shutdown Routine**

- 1 hour before sleep = **no decisions, no screens, no food**.
- Ritual: turn lights low → brush teeth → read fiction → sleep.
- If you want one rule only: **zero screens 60 minutes before sleep.**

#### 3. **No Blue Light Late**

- Install f.lux or Night Shift on devices.
- Or better: don't use devices. Output > input. Do nothing.

#### 4. **No Stimulants After 6h of Wake**

- If you wake at 06:30, **cut caffeine at 12:30 latest**.
- It stays in your system and silently ruins sleep quality.

#### 5. **Anchor It to Food**

- Eat your first meal within 2h of waking. That meal (plus light) teaches your body: "day has begun".

## **8. Communication Control (Email & Message Discipline)**

**Problem if ignored**: You operate on _other people's timeframes_, not your own. Your attention is leased out, not sovereign.

### Your System Should Include:

#### 1. **2 Email Check Windows Per Day**

- Example: 11:00--11:30 and 16:30--17:00.
- Block them in your calendar. Never check outside of them.
- During those blocks: triage → respond → archive → exit. Done.

#### 2. **No Notifications--Ever**

- Turn off badges, sounds, banners for email, Slack, WhatsApp.
- Set phone to **Do Not Disturb** by default, whitelist only essentials.

#### 3. **Canned Responses (Templates)**

Create templates for the following:

- Declining meetings
- Redirecting inquiries
- Saying no to unpaid work or speculative ideas

Example:

> "Thanks for reaching out. I'm currently at capacity and not taking on additional calls or projects. Appreciate your understanding."

Store them in a text expander or notes app. Saves 20+ minutes/day.

#### 4. **Segment Your Inbox**

- Rules/filters that auto-label:

    - Newsletters → "/Reading"

    - Transactions → "/Receipts"

    - Priority clients → "/Action"

This makes triage instant. Inbox Zero in <10 minutes.

## **10. The Default "No" System (Boundary Architecture)**

**Problem if ignored**: You will say yes to obligations that drain you. And once you say yes once, it becomes precedent.

### Your System Should Include:

#### 1. **Pre-Written No's**

Templates for saying no to:

- Calls
- Speculative partnerships
- Free work
- Introductions
- "Can I pick your brain?"

Example:

> "I've committed to a fixed execution calendar right now and can't take on anything outside of it. Hope you understand."

These remove emotion from decision-making. No negotiation. Just execution.

#### 2. **Public Boundary Page**

Have a visible link (website, LinkedIn, Notion) with:

- What you do
- What you don't do
- What to expect if contacting you

> Example: "I don't join early-stage advisory boards, sign NDAs, or do calls under 30 minutes."

This turns away non-serious people automatically.

#### 3. **Personal Rulebook**

Define a small doc for yourself with the following:

- I never… [join unpaid calls]
- I always… [ask for context before accepting a meeting]
- I only… [do deep work in the morning]

Even if private, this codifies your boundaries. No improvisation. Just rules.

#### 4. **Make "Yes" Costly**

Treat every "yes" as a commitment of hours. Ask:

- Is it worth 3 hours of my future?
- Does this fit any core priority?
- Will this bring compounding returns?

If not: auto-no.
