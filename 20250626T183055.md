**Correction**  
A more exact request would read: _"Derive a cost-efficient desktop architecture from fundamental workload requirements (4K 100 Hz gaming and mixed productivity), enumerating each component and the logic behind its inclusion."_

* * *

### 1 Design Premises

- **Performance floor** Native 4 K at ≥ 90 fps in modern engines, sustained under productivity loads.
- **Longevity** AM5 platform (road-mapped by AMD to 2028+) and ATX 3.1 PSU.
- **Budget ceiling** ≈ €1 550 retail in Germany (Frankfurt market).
- **Noise / thermals** Air-only solution, no exotic loops.

### 2 Resulting Bill of Materials

| Tier-1 components | Street price (EUR) | Rationale & evidence | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **CPU** AMD Ryzen 7 7700 8 C / 16 T | ≈ €240 | 8-core Zen 4 secures multicore headroom while undercutting X3D pricing . | 
| **CPU cooler** DeepCool AK620 (optional) | ≈ €60 | Dual-tower >190 W dissipation; stock cooler suffices at stock TDP but limits boost margin . | 
| **Mainboard** Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX | ≈ €165 new / €120 refurb | PCIe 5.0 × 4 M.2, VRM overhead for future 12-/16-core drops . | 
| **Memory** 32 GB (2 × 16) DDR5-6000 CL30 (Silicon Power Zenith or equivalent) | ≈ €83 | Sweet-spot latency/throughput, EXPO-ready ([pcgamer.com](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/32-gb-of-ddr5-ram-for-usd83-will-see-you-ready-to-shield-bash-your-way-through-doom-the-dark-ages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). | 
| **GPU** Radeon RX 7900 XT 20 GB | €619 -- €680 | 4 K raster performance within 10 % of RTX 4080 S at 60 % of the price . | 
| **SSD** Crucial P3 Plus 2 TB NVMe Gen4 | ≈ €114 | 5 GB/s sequential; ample capacity for workflows/games . | 
| **PSU** Corsair RM850e (2025, ATX 3.1, 12V-2×6) | €118 -- €150 | Gold efficiency; native 600 W GPU cable for RDNA 3/RTX 50 . | 
| **Chassis** Phanteks Eclipse G360A (ATX, mesh, 3 × 140 mm) | ≈ €100 | Proven airflow; fits 400 mm GPUs and 360 mm radiators . | 

**Indicative total:** €1 465 bare-bones / €1 525 with the AK620.

### 3 Justification Chains

1. **CPU vs. GPU balance** At 4 K the load is ≥ 75 % GPU-bound; investing in the 7900 XT yields the highest tangible fps/€ delta. The Ryzen 7 7700 grants adequate thread budget for compile/render tasks while keeping platform cost low. Upgrading to a 7800X3D (+ €110) nets single-digit fps gains--poor ROI given the present GPU ceiling.

2. **Platform longevity** B650 boards with robust VRM and DDR5 6000 CL30 kits hit the current Zen 4 efficiency sweet spot. The AM5 socket roadmap allows a later drop-in Zen 6 upgrade without board or memory replacement.

3. **Power envelope** Full-load draw (CPU 125 W, GPU 340 W, rest 60 W) peaks near 525 W. An 850 W ATX 3.1 unit provides ≥ 40 % headroom, silent operation under Eco-mode, and forward compatibility with next-gen GPUs.

4. **Thermals & acoustics** The G360A mesh and three stock D-RGB fans keep delta-T °C well below throttling thresholds. The optional AK620 shaves ~8--10 °C off CPU core temps at 100 % load, sustaining higher boost clocks.

5. **Cost‐efficiency checkpoint** Alternative "budget-GPU" path (RX 7800 XT 16 GB @ ≈ €429) drops system cost to ~€1 275 but caps typical 4 K frame-rates to 60--70 fps, negating your monitor's 100 Hz potential--strategically unsound given stated requirements.

### 4 Upgrade Trajectory

- **2026--27** Drop-in Zen 5C/Zen 6 CPU (likely BIOS-supported) + second 2 TB Gen 5 SSD when price/GB falls below €0.05.
- **2028** GPU refresh to RDNA 5 / RTX 5070 Ti class--the RM850e already complies with 12V-2×6 current spec.
- **Peripheral refresh** Replace worn Razer input devices ad-hoc; they no longer constrain overall throughput.

### 5 Actionable Decision

Execute the full rebuild now; partial grafts onto your 2014 platform misallocate capital and retain multiple systemic bottlenecks. Liquidate legacy parts while resale value persists and redeploy the proceeds toward the above configuration.
