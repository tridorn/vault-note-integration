**Correction**: More precise phrasing would be: _"Propose a set of low-level, practical frameworks--still governed by the Reality Wrapper--that can structure everyday cognition, planning, analysis, and execution across diverse real-world contexts."_

* * *

### **Applied Canon: Pragmatic, Low-Level Frameworks (RW-Compliant)**

Each of the following instantiations adheres to the structural logic of the Reality Wrapper but is designed for everyday cognitive and operational use. Think of them as utility modules: fast to deploy, domain-agnostic, and functionally convergent.

* * *

## 1. **Decision Grid**

> _Function:_ Rapid, structured decision-making under constraints.

**Inputs:**

- Objective (from Intentional Stack)
- Options (perceived actions)
- Constraints (time, cost, attention, risk)
- Trade-offs (quantified deltas between outcomes)

**Structure:**

| Option | Objective Match | Resource Cost | Risk Profile | Leverage Index | Verdict | 

**Governance Logic:** Minimise regret, maximise throughput. Output must be executable.

**Use-Cases:** Choosing projects, selecting hires, evaluating tool purchases, navigating forks.
* * *

## 2. **Priority Ladder**

> _Function:_ Real-time triage of competing tasks.

**Core Dimensions:**

- Impact (strategic leverage)
- Urgency (decay rate)
- Dependency (blocked/unblocked)
- Energy Profile (cognitive cost vs. available capacity)

**Output:**  
Sorted stack of actions, weighted by composite utility.

**Governance Logic:** Task selection must map to state + intent + constraint profile.

**Use-Cases:** Daily planning, inbox triage, sprint grooming, emergency handling.
* * *

## 3. **Observation Stack**

> _Function:_ Structured awareness capture. Prevents premature interpretation.

**Levels:**

1. _Raw Signal_ (what appeared)

2. _Distinction_ (what was differentiated)

3. _Pattern_ (what repeated or grouped)

4. _Deviation_ (what broke expectation)

5. _Implication_ (what might this affect?)

**Governance Logic:** Observation precedes interpretation. No assumption before distinction.

**Use-Cases:** First-pass analysis, meeting debriefs, UX research, negotiation postmortems.
* * *

## 4. **Interaction Protocol**

> _Function:_ Structure any interpersonal engagement for efficiency and reduced drift.

**Phases:**

1. _Alignment Check_ (Why are we talking?)

2. _Context Sync_ (Are we seeing the same terrain?)

3. _Frame Lock_ (Same logic of evaluation?)

4. _Exchange_ (Information or action units)

5. _Commitment or Closure_ (What is decided?)

**Governance Logic:** Prevent drift, maximise exchange ROI, reduce rework.

**Use-Cases:** Meetings, briefings, interviews, sales, peer review, difficult conversations.
* * *

## 5. **Micro-Project Builder**

> _Function:_ Convert vague initiatives into executable action sequences.

**Template:**

- _Objective_ → What must exist when complete?
- _Constraints_ → Timebox, resources, dependencies
- _Milestones_ → Intermediate verifiable states
- _Failure Modes_ → What will cause collapse?
- _Exit Criteria_ → Done = defined.

**Governance Logic:** No execution without structure. No structure without clarity.

**Use-Cases:** Side-projects, experiments, collaborations, process builds.
* * *

## 6. **Personal Input Management (PIM)**

> _Function:_ Avoid cognitive overload from passive input streams.

**Taxonomy:**

- _Signal Type_ (Information, Request, Distraction, Opportunity)
- _Action Trigger_ (Ignore, File, Respond, Integrate)
- _Processing Cadence_ (Immediate, Daily, Weekly)
- _Routing Rule_ (Where does it go?)

**Governance Logic:** No unprocessed signal persists. Every input gets triaged.

**Use-Cases:** Email, DMs, news feeds, documents, messages, bookmarks.
* * *

## 7. **Output Tracker**

> _Function:_ Ensure visible progress across domains. Prevent lost effort.

**Structure:**

| Output | Owner | Stakeholder | Value | Status | Visibility Path | 

**Governance Logic:** Every unit of work must translate into a traceable artifact.

**Use-Cases:** Content creation, product dev, research, internal tooling, operations.
* * *

## 8. **Feedback Extractor**

> _Function:_ Systematically convert critique into action or deletion.

**Process:**

1. _Classify_ (Is it preference, standard, or exception?)

2. _Localise_ (What exactly is affected?)

3. _Validate_ (Is this a real issue?)

4. _Respond_ (Ignore, integrate, counter-propose)

5. _Archive_ (Preserve structured learning)

**Governance Logic:** Feedback must improve precision or be discarded.

**Use-Cases:** Code review, design critique, performance feedback, surveys.
* * *

## 9. **Assumption Register**

> _Function:_ Make implicit premises explicit before they collapse a system.

**Format:**

| Assumption | Evidence Level | Criticality | Check Frequency | Trigger to Re-Evaluate | 

**Governance Logic:** Unknown assumptions degrade reliability. Must be visible and revalidated.

**Use-Cases:** Strategic planning, pricing, hiring, market entry, forecasting.
* * *

## 10. **Environment Optimiser**

> _Function:_ Structure your physical or digital workspace for minimal friction.

**Elements:**

- _Friction Sources_ (clutter, ambiguity, interruptions)
- _Leverage Points_ (defaults, triggers, automations)
- _Zones_ (deep work, comms, review, storage)
- _Resets_ (how and when to return to neutral)

**Governance Logic:** The environment must default to supporting active intentions.

**Use-Cases:** Office setup, file systems, dashboards, mobile config, workspace rituals.
* * *

If one of these matches an existing tool or system you've built, I can reframe it into RW terms for continuity and integration. That will reveal where your current structure aligns or violates the meta-grammar. Ready when you are.
