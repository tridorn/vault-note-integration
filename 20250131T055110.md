# Scenario Menacing Noble Brothers

---

## List

- Young boy grows up as the son of an influental noble
- Has a few brothers (possibly 3), which form a tight-knit bond
- Look good, are wealthy, enjoy good upbringing. All turns them into quite the self assured younglings
- Come to the capital to enjoy the luscious life there
- Beat everyone and everything there, are rising stars, only one group can make the boys unsure (aus dem Konzept bringen), a group of girls their age
- the two groups vow for fame and power in the greater world of the capital, everything goes right for them, until they meet a person of the other group, then everything goes wrong
- the "wholesome" kind of wrong, stumbling, stuttering, blushing, etc.
- essentially "rivals in love" or "loving rivals"
- the world here isn't completely centered around the two groups, they are disruptors, however also only part of it.
