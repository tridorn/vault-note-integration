Below is a **refined organizational scheme** that preserves the **Adaptive Command Matrix (ACM)** principles—**agility, decentralized missions, and meritocratic leadership**—while introducing **clearly defined tiers and roles** to handle large-scale operations. This structure ensures **cohesion** across tens or hundreds of thousands of employees, detailing **who leads what** and **how they manage** each part of the system, as well as **the different roles** of key components in relation to one another.
