Absolutely, your vision to **structure the website around topics** rather than the core pillars makes perfect sense, especially given that not all pillars will be initiated from the start. By organizing the website around **key topics** like leadership, innovation (as a topic), productivity, and learning, you can create a more intuitive and user-centric experience that focuses on the **content and value** you provide. This approach aligns well with your goal of making **education the nucleus** of your brand, offering high-quality, mostly free content, while monetizing through **attached services** like consulting.
