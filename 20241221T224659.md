Not quite—while there are strong **primary associations** between the disciplines (assent, desire/aversion, and action) and specific virtues, they are not strictly exclusive. Each discipline can involve multiple virtues depending on the context. Let’s break this down more clearly:

---

### **1. Primary Associations Between Disciplines and Virtues**

	- **Assent** (Judgment of impressions): Primarily tied to **Wisdom**  
	  Wisdom ensures you perceive reality correctly and make rational judgments.  
	  Example: “This criticism is not harmful in itself; it’s how I interpret it.”

	- **Desire/Aversion** (What to pursue or avoid): Primarily tied to **Temperance** and **Courage**  
	  - Temperance helps regulate desires (avoiding excess).  
	  - Courage helps face fears and aversions (enduring difficulties bravely).  
	  Example: “I want comfort, but I will endure this discomfort for the sake of the greater good.”

	- **Action** (Behavior): Primarily tied to **Justice** and **Courage**  
	  - Justice ensures fairness and fulfilling obligations.  
	  - Courage enables virtuous action despite fear or difficulty.  
	  Example: “I’ll do what’s right, even if it’s hard.”

### **2. Overlapping Virtues Across Disciplines**

While the above associations are primary, any discipline may involve *any* of the four virtues. Here’s how they overlap:

#### **Assent And the Virtues**

	- **Wisdom**: Ensuring judgments are rational and aligned with reality.  
	  Example: “Is this thought true and helpful?”
	- **Courage**: Facing the truth, even when uncomfortable.  
	  Example: “I must admit my mistake rather than hide it.”
	- **Temperance**: Restraining impulsive or excessive judgments.  
	  Example: “I’ll avoid jumping to conclusions out of anger.”
	- **Justice**: Evaluating impressions about fairness and ethics.  
	  Example: “Am I judging others fairly, or am I being biased?”

#### **Desire/Aversion And the Virtues**

	- **Temperance**: Moderating desires and resisting excess.  
	  Example: “Do I need this, or am I indulging unnecessarily?”
	- **Courage**: Facing fears or aversions bravely.  
	  Example: “I’ll confront this challenge instead of avoiding it.”
	- **Wisdom**: Knowing what is worth desiring or avoiding.  
	  Example: “Is this truly good, or am I chasing an illusion?”
	- **Justice**: Aligning desires with fairness and duty.  
	  Example: “Am I pursuing what is good for others, not just myself?”

#### **Action And the Virtues**

	- **Justice**: Acting fairly, fulfilling obligations, and helping others.  
	  Example: “How can I act in a way that serves others?”
	- **Courage**: Acting despite fear or difficulty.  
	  Example: “I’ll speak up for what’s right, even if it’s unpopular.”
	- **Wisdom**: Acting thoughtfully and strategically.  
	  Example: “What is the best course of action here?”
	- **Temperance**: Acting with self-restraint and balance.  
	  Example: “I’ll avoid overreacting and respond calmly.”

### **3. Practical Implications for Stoic Practice**

Understanding that virtues can overlap across disciplines allows for a more flexible and nuanced practice. For example:  
	- When dealing with a fear (**desire/aversion**), **wisdom** might help you determine whether the fear is rational, while **courage** helps you act despite it.  
	- When taking action (**action**), **wisdom** ensures the action is thoughtful, **justice** ensures it is fair, and **courage** ensures you follow through despite challenges.

This overlap reflects the **interconnectedness of the virtues** in Stoicism:  
> “The virtues are inseparable, because you cannot be courageous without being wise, or just without being temperate.”

### **4. Refined System: Discipline-Virtue Matrix**

Here’s a simplified matrix showing how each virtue can apply across the three disciplines:

| **Discipline**       | **Wisdom**                                  | **Courage**                              | **Justice**                              | **Temperance**                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Assent**            | Rational judgment of impressions.          | Facing uncomfortable truths.             | Fair judgments about others.             | Restraining impulsive thoughts.          |
| **Desire/Aversion**   | Knowing what is truly worth pursuing.       | Braving fears and aversions.             | Desiring what is fair and right.         | Moderating excessive desires.            |
| **Action**            | Strategic and thoughtful action.           | Acting despite difficulty.               | Fulfilling duties and obligations.       | Acting with restraint and balance.       |

### **5. Why This Perspective Matters**

1. **Flexibility in Application**: Recognizing overlap allows you to adapt Stoicism to complex situations. A single moment may involve multiple disciplines and virtues simultaneously.  
	- Example: When standing up for a colleague, **justice** motivates your action, **courage** helps you overcome fear, and **wisdom** ensures you do so effectively.

2. **Strengthens Your Practice**: By integrating multiple virtues into each discipline, you cultivate a well-rounded Stoic mindset.  
	- Example: While practicing **temperance** in avoiding excess, you also strengthen **wisdom** by reflecting on what is truly necessary.

3. **Deeper Understanding**: This perspective highlights how Stoic virtues and disciplines are interconnected. They work together to create a unified, virtuous life.

In conclusion, while each discipline has primary virtues (assent → wisdom, desire → temperance/courage, action → justice/courage), the virtues interact across all disciplines, offering flexibility and depth in Stoic practice.
