Your query could have been rephrased as: *"As a 24-year-old considering either a semi-permanent lifestyle with real estate ownership or a flexible renting-based lifestyle, which path would you recommend, and how should I approach it?"* Below is a carefully structured recommendation and roadmap, tailored to your age, lifestyle goals, and potential growth trajectory.

### **Recommendation: Flexible Renting with Strategic Ownership Later**

At 24, flexibility is paramount for personal exploration, career growth, and financial stability. Renting and frequently changing locations gives you the freedom to:

1. **Discover Ideal Locations**: Experience different regions and cultures to learn where you feel most fulfilled and where opportunities align with your lifestyle goals.
2. **Avoid Overcommitting**: Buying real estate ties you to specific locations and markets, which may not align with your evolving preferences and career trajectory.
3. **Build Financial Stability First**: Accumulate wealth, grow your income streams, and build a diversified investment portfolio before committing to property ownership.

Later, as your preferences and financial standing solidify, you can transition into **strategic real estate ownership**, focusing on long-term value and rental income.

### **Step-by-Step Course: Renting Now, Ownership Later**

#### **Phase 1 (Ages 24–27): Flexible Exploration**

**Goals**: Develop skills, build wealth, explore locations, and refine your lifestyle preferences.

1. **Build a Remote Income**:
	- Establish location-independent income streams:
	  - Freelancing, consulting, or remote work.
	  - Start a side hustle (e.g., content creation, e-commerce, digital products).
	  - Invest in passive income sources like dividend stocks or REITs.
	- Target a monthly income of **€3,000–€5,000** to comfortably sustain a digital nomad lifestyle.

2. **Travel and Rent Globally**:
	- **Duration**: Spend 3–6 months per location.
	- **Regions to Explore**:
	  - **Europe**: Budapest, Lisbon, Valencia.
	  - **Asia**: Chiang Mai, Bali, Kyoto.
	  - **Latin America**: Medellín, Mexico City, Buenos Aires.
	  - **Africa**: Cape Town.
	- Use platforms like Airbnb, Flatio, or Spotahome for mid-term rentals.
	- Prioritize affordable yet vibrant cities to maximize experiences without financial strain.

3. **Save Aggressively**:
	- Allocate **30–50% of your income** toward savings and investments.
	- Build an **emergency fund** covering 6–12 months of living expenses.
	- Invest in low-cost index funds, ETFs, or other diversified assets for long-term growth.

4. **Learn the Real Estate Market**:
	- Research real estate trends in regions you love.
	- Track prices, rental yields, and legal frameworks for foreign buyers.
	- Familiarize yourself with property taxes, ownership costs, and local regulations.

#### **Phase 2 (Ages 27–30): Strategic Real Estate Ownership**

**Goals**: Begin transitioning to semi-permanent bases with strategic property investments.

1. **Identify Base Locations**:
	- Choose 1–2 regions where you’d want semi-permanent homes.
	- Consider:
	  - Climate and lifestyle alignment.
	  - Proximity to major hubs or travel opportunities.
	  - Real estate market stability and rental potential.

2. **Purchase First Property**:
	- **Criteria for Selection**:
	  - Affordability: Start with lower-cost regions offering high rental yields (e.g., Budapest, Medellín, or Tbilisi).
	  - Dual Purpose: Serve as your base for part of the year and generate rental income when unoccupied.
	- **Financing**:
	  - Save for a down payment (~20–40% of the property value).
	  - Use local mortgages where possible, but avoid over-leveraging.
	- **Property Type**:
	  - Compact apartments in central areas with strong tourist or expat demand.
	  - Prioritize properties with rental-friendly amenities (e.g., smart locks, proximity to transport).

3. **Rent and Explore Secondary Locations**:
	- Continue renting in regions where you’re not ready to commit to ownership.
	- Use rental income from your owned property to offset costs.

#### **Phase 3 (Ages 30–35): Expand Ownership and Stabilize**

**Goals**: Build a diversified real estate portfolio and establish a sustainable seasonal lifestyle.

1. **Expand Property Holdings**:
	- Purchase a second property in a complementary location (e.g., a tropical base like Bali or a cultural hub like Lisbon).
	- Diversify geographically to hedge against local market risks.

2. **Focus on Rental Income**:
	- Optimize properties for short-term rentals or mid-term leases to maximize returns.
	- Use rental income to finance further purchases or cover your travel and living expenses.

3. **Streamline Your Lifestyle**:
	- Establish predictable seasonal rotations (e.g., spring in Europe, summer in Scandinavia, autumn in Asia, winter in Latin America).
	- Minimize active management by outsourcing property management and automating finances.

---

#### **Phase 4 (Ages 35+): Semi-Permanent Lifestyle with Global Bases**

**Goals**: Achieve financial independence and establish a balanced, fulfilling routine.

1. **Own 3–5 Properties**:
	- Ensure your properties cover all key seasons and generate enough income to sustain your lifestyle.
	- Examples:
	  - **Spring**: Lisbon (Mediterranean charm and mild weather).
	  - **Summer**: Stockholm (long daylight hours and Nordic beauty).
	  - **Autumn**: Chiang Mai (post-monsoon coolness and affordability).
	  - **Winter**: Cape Town (Southern Hemisphere summer and luxury).

2. **Diversify Investments**:
	- Use additional income to invest in equities, REITs, or other passive income assets.
	- Ensure liquidity for emergencies or future ventures.

3. **Optimize for Fulfillment**:
	- Focus on personal projects, hobbies, or philanthropy.
	- Use your flexibility to engage in meaningful local and global communities.
