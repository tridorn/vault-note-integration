# CRAPM Adjust Phase Data Categories for Google Form

For logging data from the Adjust phase of your CRAPM routine efficiently in a Google Form, you'll want to focus on capturing the essential information that reflects the adjustments made without making the process too cumbersome. Here's a streamlined approach to logging these adjustments, including suggested data categories and units for each field in your Google Form:

1. **Date and Time**
	- **Unit:** Timestamp
	- **Description:** Automatically capture the date and time when the adjustment log entry is made.

2. **Type of Adjustment**
	- **Unit:** Multiple choice
	- **Options:**
	  - Distraction Removal
	  - Priority Change
	  - Task Delegation
	  - Task Postponement
	  - Break Schedule Adjustment
	  - Environmental Change (e.g., lighting, noise level)
	  - Workflow/Process Change
	  - Other (provide an option to specify)

3. **Reason for Adjustment**
	- **Unit:** Short answer
	- **Description:** Briefly describe the reason for the adjustment (e.g., "minimize interruptions," "address urgent task not previously identified").

4. **Effectiveness Rating (Post-Adjustment)**
	- **Unit:** Linear scale
	- **Description:** Rate the perceived effectiveness of the adjustment in improving focus or productivity.
	- **Scale:** 1 (Not Effective) to 5 (Highly Effective)

5. **Additional Notes**

This structured approach to logging adjustments in a Google Form allows for quick data entry, ensuring that the process is not time-consuming. The data captured will enable you to track the types of adjustments you frequently make, understand the reasons behind these changes, and evaluate their effectiveness over time. This insight can help you refine your workflow and environment for optimal productivity and well-being.
