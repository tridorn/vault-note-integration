Correction: You should have asked: “How do I navigate the filesystem via the command-line interface as a Linux beginner?”

⸻

Filesystem Navigation – Minimal Set

You only need four primary commands to move efficiently:

1. pwd – Print working directory

Shows where you are.

pwd

Example output:

/home/yourusername


⸻

2. ls – List directory contents

ls           # list current folder
ls -l        # long format (permissions, size, dates)
ls -a        # show hidden files (starting with .)

Example:

ls ~/Documents


⸻

3. cd – Change directory

cd FOLDER_NAME           # move into folder
cd ..                    # move up one level
cd                       # go to home directory
cd ~/Documents           # go to Documents
cd /etc                 # go to an absolute path

Examples:

cd ~/Documents/ObsidianVault
cd ..
cd

Use Tab for autocomplete.

⸻

4. tree (optional) – Visualise folder hierarchy

Install it inside Toolbox:

sudo dnf install tree

Then:

tree ~/Documents


⸻

Quick Practical Example:

cd ~
pwd                         # should show /home/yourname
ls                          # list home directory contents
cd Documents
ls
cd ObsidianVault
ls -l


⸻

Tip: Use Absolute and Relative Paths Precisely
	•	/ = root of filesystem
	•	~ = your home directory
	•	. = current directory
	•	.. = parent directory

⸻

That’s enough to move anywhere in the system. Keep commands minimal. Memorise nothing—practice once, repeat.
