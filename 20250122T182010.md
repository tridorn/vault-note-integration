# What I Really Need

Your inquiry could have been more succinctly phrased as: “Given all the components you've outlined for the IT ecosystem, what are the essential elements that I should focus on, considering we are a student club with limited resources?”

Given that **AKB is a student initiative**, it’s crucial to strike a balance between ambition and practicality. You won’t need every single component I’ve outlined, especially considering budget constraints, team size, and immediate needs. Below is a streamlined approach focusing on the **essentials** you should prioritize for an effective, resource-efficient setup.

### **Core Priorities for AKB’s IT Ecosystem**

---

### **1. Simple and Scalable Web Hosting**

#### **Why It’s Essential**

Your **member portal** is the heart of the initiative. It should serve as a hub for event management, registrations, announcements, and file sharing. However, you don’t need a highly complex infrastructure—start small with a lightweight, manageable system.

#### **What You Really Need**

- **Amazon Lightsail** instead of EC2: Since this is a student club, you don’t need the complexity of EC2 unless scaling becomes critical. **Lightsail** offers an easier, more cost-effective way to launch and manage your member portal or website with pre-configured applications like **WordPress**.
  - **Cost**: Lightsail starts at ~$5/month, and it’s easy to scale up if needed.
- **Basic Website/Portal**: Start with a **WordPress** site for simplicity, where members can register for events, view announcements, and download resources. WordPress has easy-to-use plugins for event management.

#### Focus

- Keep the website or portal lean and focused on key member needs like **event registration** and **file downloads**.

---

### **2. Basic File Storage (Documents and Media)**

#### **Why It’s Essential**

You’ll need a place to store important documents, such as meeting notes, event materials, and media like recorded webinars. However, extensive file management systems like **WorkDocs** or internal shared drives are overkill for now.

#### **What You Really Need**

- **Amazon S3**: This is perfect for your document and media storage needs. You can store and share files easily with simple access controls.
  - **Cost**: Free for the first 5GB under the AWS Free Tier. If you exceed this, the cost is ~$0.023/GB.
  
- **File Sharing**: For member access, integrate S3 with your portal, so members can download shared files directly from the website.

#### Focus

- Keep file storage in S3 simple and use built-in **WordPress plugins** to connect your files directly to your portal for easy access.

---

### **3. Event Management and Registrations**

#### **Why It’s Essential**

Managing event registrations (especially for the conference) and tracking attendee lists is one of your core needs. You don’t need a complex database for this, but you do need a tool to keep this organized.

#### **What You Really Need**

- **WordPress Event Plugins**: You can use free or low-cost WordPress plugins like **Event Manager** or **WP Event Manager** to handle event registration, ticketing, and attendance tracking.
  - **Cost**: Most plugins offer a free tier, with paid upgrades for more advanced features (typically ~$50/year if needed).

- **Google Forms** (Alternative): For small-scale events or simple surveys, you could also use **Google Forms** to handle registrations and link this back to a **Google Sheets** document for easy tracking.

#### Focus

- Start with simple, ready-made tools (WordPress plugins or Google Forms) to manage event registrations without setting up a complex backend infrastructure.

---

### **4. Video Conferencing for Webinars and Events**

#### **Why It’s Essential**

You will need to host **virtual events**, like webinars, guest lectures, or meetings. However, you don’t need a custom or embedded video conferencing solution, as most third-party tools will suffice.

#### **What You Really Need**

- **Zoom (Free Tier)**: Use **Zoom** for online meetings and webinars. The free tier gives you 40-minute meetings with up to 100 participants, which should be enough for most student events.
  - **Cost**: Free for up to 40 minutes and 100 attendees.
  
- **YouTube Live** (for larger events): For broadcasting larger events or recordings, **YouTube Live** is free and easy to integrate with your website for public viewing.

#### Focus

- Stick to **Zoom** and **YouTube Live** for simple, low-cost solutions, without integrating more expensive or complex platforms like **Amazon Chime**.

---

### **5. Basic Ticketing and Support System**

#### **Why It’s Essential**

Managing member queries and technical issues efficiently ensures smooth operations, but you don’t need a complex ticketing system for the size and scope of your initiative.

#### **What You Really Need**

- **Google Forms** or **Trello**: Use **Google Forms** to collect member queries and feedback, or a simple **Trello board** for managing internal issues and tracking tasks.
  - **Cost**: Free.
  
- **Freshdesk (Free Tier)**: If you prefer a more structured ticketing system, **Freshdesk’s free plan** is perfect for tracking and responding to support queries without complex setups.

#### Focus

- Keep it simple with **Google Forms** or **Freshdesk**’s free plan to handle basic member support without incurring extra costs.

---

### **6. Automation for Essential Tasks**

#### **Why It’s Essential**

While automation is a great way to scale your processes, you only need it for simple tasks like sending event reminders or collecting feedback. Complex automation can wait until the club scales further.

#### **What You Really Need**

- **Zapier (Free Tier)**: For basic automations, use **Zapier** to connect apps like Google Sheets, WordPress, and email for simple notifications or task triggers.
  - **Cost**: Free for up to 100 tasks per month.
  
- **AWS Lambda (Optional)**: Only use **AWS Lambda** if you need to automate specific tasks like data backups or minor file processing. For now, Zapier can cover most of your automation needs.

#### Focus

- Use **Zapier** for simple automations and task management, deferring more complex setups like Lambda for later stages.

---

### **7. Security and Identity Management**

#### **Why It’s Essential**

Keeping your systems secure, even if simple, is critical. You don’t need enterprise-level security, but basic protections like **IAM roles** and **MFA** are a must.

#### **What You Really Need**

- **AWS IAM**: Use **IAM roles** to control who can access your AWS resources (like S3 buckets, databases, etc.).
  - **Cost**: Free.
  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enable MFA for key accounts (admins, database managers) to ensure higher security.

#### Focus

- Basic **IAM roles** and **MFA** will ensure your core systems remain secure without needing heavy investment in enterprise-level solutions.

---

### **What You Don’t Need Right Now**

- **Amazon WorkDocs** or any complex document collaboration tools. Google Drive or even simple S3 storage will suffice for file sharing.
- **Complex Database Solutions**: Stick with a basic registration plugin or Google Sheets for managing member data. You won’t need Amazon RDS unless you scale significantly.
- **Expensive Automation (like Lambda)**: Keep automation simple through tools like Zapier until you need more powerful serverless functions.
- **Chime or Microsoft Teams**: Stick to **Zoom** and **YouTube Live** for webinars.

---

### **Final Essential Setup**

- **Amazon Lightsail** for hosting your member portal (WordPress).
- **Amazon S3** for file storage (documents, media).
- **Event plugins** (like WP Event Manager) or **Google Forms** for registration.
- **Zoom (free)** for video conferencing and webinars.
- **Google Forms** or **Freshdesk (free)** for support ticketing.
- **Zapier (free)** for basic automations.
- **AWS IAM** with **MFA** for security.

This streamlined setup will keep costs low, operations simple, and give you everything you need to run an efficient, functional IT ecosystem for AKB.
