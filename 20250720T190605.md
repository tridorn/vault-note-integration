Excellent -- now that your **metadata schema**, **folder system**, and **lifecycle workflow** are rationalized and versionable, the final piece is:

> ‚úÖ **Note body structure** -- How to write individual notes clearly, consistently, and scalably.

Let's now design a **future-proof internal structure for your notes**: one that supports fast capture, layered thinking, automation, and human readability -- without ever feeling like "just overhead."
* * *

## üß± Guiding Principles for Note Body Structure

| Principle | Why it matters | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Atomic structure** | You think in units -- so each note captures _one idea, task, insight, or concept_. | 
| **Separation of layers** | Metadata ‚â† structure ‚â† content ‚â† commentary ‚â† history. Each has its place. | 
| **Progressively deep** | Structure allows you to write fast _and_ refine over time without mess. | 
| **Anchor to metadata** | The body should mirror metadata like `title`, `summary`, `status`. | 
| **Machine-parsable blocks** | Use section headers and clearly marked boundaries for automation (Dataview, LLMs, exports). | 
* * *

## üìù Canonical Note Template (in-body)
    
    
    # üìå title%20from%20YAML
    
    > üîñ Summary  
    > same%20as%20%60desc.summary%60%20in%20YAML%20--%20optional%20quote%20box%2C%20bolded%20keywords
    
    ---
    
    ## 1. Context
    
    - **Why this note exists**  
      Short paragraph on trigger, question, goal, or source -- like "This came out of reading Deep Work," or "Spontaneous idea during a walk."
    - **Stage / Status**  
      Reflected via badges or callouts (optional):  
      > [!info]+ Status  
      > stage: work  
      > status: draft  
      > linked project: `[[P2025-001-DeepWork]]`
    
    ---
    
    ## 2. Core Content
    
    This is the **main idea, draft, insight, explanation, or task body**.  
    Structure freely -- use Markdown headers, bullets, numbered steps, examples.
    
    Use:
    - `##` for major sections
    - `###` for layers within
    - `> [!tip]` or `> [!warning]` for emphasis blocks
    
    Try to:
    - Write full sentences (machine readability)
    - Use one sentence per paragraph when outlining
    - Link to related notes inline with `[[uid-title]]`
    
    ---
    
    ## 3. Related
    
    Optional block for internal references.
    
    - **See also**: `[[20240614144702-FlowState]]`, `[[20240405121530-Attention_Management]]`
    - **Backlink context**: Short 1--2 line explanation why this note links to each reference.
    
    ---
    
    ## 4. Commentary / Development Log
    
    Use this to **journal your own thought process**, refinements, or timestamps.
    
    ```md
    ### 2025-07-20
    - Promoted from Triage ‚Üí Plan
    - Decided this should be a method, not a case study
    

> [!note] This is like your mini "git commit history" inside the note.

* * *

## 5. Next Steps (if any)

If this note is active (stage = work, plan), list pending actions:
    
    
    - [ ] Add examples from actual sprints
    - [ ] Ask Bob for input
    - [ ] Clean up note and move to `Library`
    

If inactive, omit this section.

    ## ‚úçÔ∏è Minimal Capture Note (Quick)
    
    ```markdown
    # Untitled insight from podcast
    
    > Thought during commute:
    > The discomfort of silence often forces people to generate weak opinions -- could be reframed into a "tension tolerance" model?
    
    

When you triage this:

- Move it to `Plan` or `Nurture`
- Replace `# Untitled...` with final title
- Add metadata
- Flesh out core sections

## üß† Evergreen Note (Library)
    
    
    # Cognitive Switching Tax
    
    > The cost imposed by shifting mental context between tasks. Research suggests it can take up to 23 minutes to regain full focus after switching.
    
    ---
    
    ## 1. Definition
    
    The cognitive switching tax refers to the decrease in mental efficiency and working memory when a person switches from one task to another...
    
    ## 2. Examples
    
    - Email interrupting deep writing
    - Slack conversation mid-debug session
    
    ## 3. Related Concepts
    
    - `[[20240614144702-FlowState]]`
    - `[[20240405121530-Attention_Management]]`
    
    ## 4. Source Notes
    
    - Cal Newport, *Deep Work*, Ch. 2
    - Gloria Mark, "Multitasking in the Digital Age"
    
    ---
    

This structure is designed to:

- Be **instantly readable**
- Feed directly into Dataview queries or LLM summarizers
- Avoid the "blank page" feeling

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Tools / Enhancements

| Tool | Purpose | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Note Composer** | Generates section scaffolds from metadata | 
| **YAML-sync linter** | Ensures title + H1 match; `desc.summary` == top quote | 
| **Dataview** | Index: show incomplete notes, notes missing a section | 
| **Callout styles** | Use Obsidian callouts (`[!info]`, `[!tip]`, etc.) to visually organize without headers | 
| **Heading regex rules** | Validate that every `Library/` note contains `## Definition`, `## Related`, etc. | 
* * *

## ‚úÖ Summary: What a Good Note Looks Like

| Element | Present? | Why | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `# Title` | ‚úÖ | Always syncs with YAML | 
| Summary (quote or callout) | ‚úÖ | Readable in previews, hover, search | 
| Clear sections | ‚úÖ | Enables re-use, extraction, skimming | 
| Inline links | ‚úÖ | Strengthens graph, encourages reuse | 
| Commentary | Optional | Shows evolution / author's thought | 
| Next steps | Optional | Only for active work | 

* * *

Would you like me to generate:

- Markdown templates for each note type (Capture, Library, Project, Research)?
- A script to auto-sync `title`, `summary`, and H1?
- Obsidian command palette snippets to insert scaffolds?

Let me know -- we can fully automate this scaffolding layer next.
