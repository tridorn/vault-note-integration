You should have said:  
**“Tell me practically: how do I source these companies? Where do I find the information? What channels, tactics, and tools should Eupator use to build a real Mittelstand deal pipeline?”**

Here’s the direct, tactical answer you need:

---

# **How to Source Acquisition Targets for Eupator**

You have three real-world channels. Use all of them in parallel.

---

## **1. Direct Proprietary Outreach (best long-term flywheel)**

| What | How | Tools |
|-----|-----|------|
| **Owner Lists** | Find companies fitting your size + sector criteria | Handelsregister (Germany/Switzerland), North Data, FirmenWissen |
| **Direct Contact** | Write highly personalized letters (yes, real mail). Follow up via call if no reply. | Craft 1-page "Succession Guardian" letters, offer no-pressure dialogue |
| **Conferences** | Attend SME owner conferences (e.g., UnternehmerTage, local IHK succession events) | Prepare Corpus Diagnostic teaser: offer free health audit |

**Goal**:  
Build trust with owners **before they list** their company with brokers.

---

## **2. Intermediary / Broker Sourcing (fast, deal-ready inventory)**

| What | How | Tools |
|------|-----|------|
| **M&A Boutiques** | Build relationships with 5–10 small regional firms handling deals < €20m EV | Cold approach boutique M&A shops (use LinkedIn, BDU directory in Germany) |
| **Search-fund Marketplaces** | Tap platforms listing small succession deals (e.g., Axial, DealCircle, NextChange, Succession Link) | Search filters: Germany, Austria, Switzerland; €1–10m EBIT; services/software |
| **Accountants & Fiduciaries** | Many family accountants manage succession planning quietly | Offer simple co-sell partnerships (accountant recommends you first) |

**Goal**:  
Get **first-look rights** or be added to buyer lists early.

---

## **3. Inbound Marketing Magnet (medium-term play)**

| What | How | Tools |
|------|-----|------|
| **Succession Content** | Build “Eupator Succession Center” microsite (plain, authoritative) | White-papers: "How to Secure Your Company Legacy"; “Corpus Diagnostic: a New Standard for Healthy Transfers” |
| **Succession Webinars** | Free educational webinars for SME owners approaching 60+ | Partner with local banks or chambers of commerce |
| **Corpus Succession Award** | Annual €10k prize for best structured SME succession story | Press attention + positioning as the home for thoughtful owners |

**Goal**:  
Create *pull* rather than just *push* over time.

---

# **Concrete Steps: Your 90-Day Pipeline Build**

| Week | Action | Deliverable |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1–2 | Identify 50–100 companies fitting ideal profile | Excel pipeline: Name, City, Revenue est., Owner est. age, Website |
| 2–4 | Send 30 tailored letters + 10 emails + 10 LinkedIn connects | Template adapted to Corpus value proposition |
| 4–6 | Call 20 boutique M&A brokers; arrange intro calls | Broker CRM built; define “send me everything < €10m EV” rule |
| 6–8 | Build v0.1 inbound site (basic: home page + corpus succession audit offer) | Landing page live + form capture system |
| 8–12 | Attend 1 succession or SME financing conference; set 10 coffee meetings | 10 personal leads or referrals |

**KPI:**  
- 10 live owner dialogues by Month 3.  
- 2–3 broker relationships yielding qualified leads.

---

# **Key Tools You Should Set Up Immediately**

| Tool | Use |
|-----|-----|
| **CRM (HubSpot free or Pipedrive)** | Track owners, brokers, status, next steps |
| **Pipeline Dashboard (Airtable / Notion)** | Visualize where leads live (cold, engaged, NDA, IOI) |
| **Mail-merge software (e.g., MailMerge365)** | Personalize at scale, but make it *hand-crafted* per owner |
| **Eupator Diagnostic Teaser PDF** | Simple one-pager explaining what a Corpus audit looks like for an SME |
| **Owner Interview Script** | 10-question call script focused on uncovering readiness, timing, and trust anchors |

---

# **Critical Success Rules**

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Never lead with “I want to buy your business.”** | Scares owners; lead with “preserving legacy + scaling your life's work.” |
| **Treat every call like a medical diagnosis, not a sale.** | Owners will open up if you *listen* like a physician. |
| **Corpus is your edge—but don’t oversell it immediately.** | First win *trust*, *then* reveal your structural advantage. |
| **Focus first on 1–2 regions.** | Flywheel is local first; Mittelstand deals are highly regional trust markets. |
| **Be ready for long courting cycles (6–18 months).** | Sellers often need emotional time to come around even after first soft yes. |

---

# **Summary**
> **Proprietary sourcing → Broker network → Inbound authority flywheel.**

You want 50 % of your pipeline from *proprietary relationships*, 30 % from *brokers*, and 20 % from *inbound* within 18–24 months.

Would you like me to now design a **Sourcing Playbook v1.0** — an operational document you can deploy inside Eupator’s Venture Division immediately? (Structured like Corpus: Initiative Source layer applied to succession targeting.)  
It would codify the entire process.
