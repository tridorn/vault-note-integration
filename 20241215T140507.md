Choosing the right name for your meta-layer is crucial to ensure it seamlessly integrates with the PARA framework while clearly conveying its purpose. Here are several name options, each with a brief explanation to help you decide which best aligns with your organizational style and objectives:

### **1. Core**
**Rationale:**  
"Core" signifies the central, most important part of something. Naming your meta-layer "Core" emphasizes its foundational role in supporting the entire PARA system.

**Example Structure:**

  - Templates
  - Workflows
  - System Frameworks

### **4. System**
**Rationale:**

### **8. Nexus**
**Rationale:**  
"Nexus" means a connection or series of connections linking two or more things. It portrays this folder as the link between various parts of your PARA system.

**Example Structure:**

  - System Guides

### **9. Centralized**

  - Templates
  - System Workflows
  - Maintenance Logs

### **10. Meta**
**Rationale:**

### **Recommendation**

**Choose a name that resonates most with your personal or professional terminology and clearly reflects the purpose of the folder.** For instance:

- **If you prefer a straightforward and descriptive term:**  
  **"System"** or **"Operations"** might be ideal.

- **If you like a more abstract or unique term:**  
  **"Nexus"** or **"Hub"** could be appealing.

- **If you want to emphasize the foundational aspect:**  
  **"Core"** or **"Foundation"** would be suitable.

Ultimately, the name should make it intuitive for you to recognize and access system-wide resources, ensuring that your PARA framework remains organized and efficient.
