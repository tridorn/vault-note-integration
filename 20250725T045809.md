It's incredibly beautiful and inspiring, of course. The locals are kind of a mix of loveable, snobby, sophisticated and yet provincial. It's technically the capital of Italy but that means nothing to most Italians who don't live in Rome.

I've never seen rain like I saw in Rome, it absolutely buckets it down. Nice, hot weather getting a bit mental in high summer when most non tourist jobs stop anyway and everyone who can fucks off.

Wonderful parks full of statues and garbage. Crappy public transport and services, I remember walking home in pitch black because all of the street lamps were broken- just try not step in dog shit.

Some of my work colleagues actually lived in the streets named after their family, so a kind of aristocratic but somewhat static society. I remember Roman friends complaining that no bars or restaurants were in the hands of anyone under the age of 70, especially in the center, which means the city is a bit stuck.

Excellent gay scene, really fun discos and bars right next to historic sites which is a bit of a head fuck.

Apartments are incredibly expensive and if they were refurbished in the 1950s they are considered new. Most romans live in very cool midcentury parts of town.

Food is orgasmic, it's a battle to not eat fried artichokes and zucchini flowers everyday. Best bread in Italy in my opinion. The water is amazing straight from the tap- just delicious.

The Vatican is a big presence, it looms large, as does the government. Every Roman man has been propositioned by a priest which is either funny or infuriating depending on your point of view. Lots of official cars driving politicians around who eat lobster and eat caviar and do fucking nothing for italy.

Tourists are everywhere but the locals turn ignoring them into an art.

Rome feels very isolated in comparison to the north of italy where lots of major cities are close to each other. The beach is easy to get to via Mussolini built train lines and it's beautiful.

Wandering around in the evening, via Giulia, piazza Farnese, it's pretty life affirming. Beautiful place.
