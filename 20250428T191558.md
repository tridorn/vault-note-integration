Below is a **punch-list of outward-facing work** that turns “file folder start-up” into a venture that *looks and sounds real* to customers, banks, vendors, and investors.

---

## 1. Brand Bedrock (Week 0-1)

| Task | What “done” looks like |
|------|-----------------------|
| **Name lock-in** | - .com or .io domain secured.<br>- EUIPO trademark search shows no conflict.<br>- Short, pronounceable, no weird spelling. |
| **One-line promise** | Sentence a 12-year-old gets: “We make green loans for small businesses fast, cheap, and safe.” |
| **Core values (3-5 words)** | e.g. “Clarity, Proof, Speed.”—these guide tone and visuals. |

---

## 2. Visual Identity (Week 1-2)

| Deliverable | Minimum spec |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Logo** | Simple icon + wordmark; works in 1-color and favicon size. |
| **Color palette** | 1 primary (trustworthy blue/green), 1 accent, 3 neutrals. |
| **Typography** | Web-safe pair: headline font + body font. |
| **Brand sheet** | 1-page PDF showing logo usage, colors (HEX + CMYK), fonts. |

*(Hire a freelancer or use Canva Pro templates; cost ≈ €500-1 000.)*

---

## 3. Narrative & Voice (Week 2-3)

| Asset | Use |
|-------|-----|
| **Long-form story (≈600 words)** | “Why we exist” for About page & PR pitches. |
| **Tone guide (1 page)** | Examples of headlines, button copy, and emails—so every writer sounds consistent. |
| **Tagline options (3)** | Short phrase for website hero and slide covers. |

---

## 4. Digital Front Door (Week 3)

| Element | Must contain |
|---------|--------------|
| **Landing site (4 pages)** | Home → Problem & Solution; “How it works” flowchart; About/Team; Contact with form.<br>Cookie banner + privacy notice compliant with GDPR. |
| **Domain email** | name@startup.com via Google Workspace. |
| **Basic SEO** | Title tags, meta description, sitemap; register on Google Search Console. |
| **Google Analytics / Matomo** | Track sign-ups and scroll depth. |

*(No heavy blog yet—just authority landing pages.)*

---

## 5. Credibility Toolkit (Week 3-4)

| Asset | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **One-pager PDF** | Logo header, pain/solution bullets, process diagram, pilot stats placeholder, contact Info. |
| **Press kit** | Zip file with logo variants, founder bios (150 words), product screenshots, and FAQ. |
| **Social proof schedule** | Plan 3 LinkedIn posts/month: customer quote, pilot announcement, regulatory insight. |

---

## 6. Legal & Trust Badges (Parallel)

| Badge / Statement | Why |
|-------------------|-----|
| **“Pending BaFin Innovation Hub” mention** | Signals regulatory engagement. |
| **GDPR privacy policy** | Mandatory; borrow template, have lawyer review. |
| **EU Green Claims Compliance line** | “Energy-saving data independently measured via smart devices.” Avoid greenwashing fines. |

---

## 7. Comms Channels Setup

- **LinkedIn company page** (primary B2B arena).  
- **Twitter/X handle** (optional, for policy watchers).  
- **Newsletter list** via MailerLite; start collecting emails on site (“Get pilot updates”).  
- **Slack or Discord vendor community** (invite-only—for installers & auditors).

---

## 8. Roll-out Sequence

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Day 0** | Domain + placeholder page (“Launch soon—join waitlist”). |
| **Day 14** | Logo, color, type approved. |
| **Day 21** | Full landing site live; press kit downloadable. |
| **Day 28** | Publish first LinkedIn post + send intro email to waitlist. |

---

## 9. Continuous Brand Hygiene

- **Quarterly brand retro:** update screenshots, stats, customer logos.  
- **Tone policing:** one person reviews all outbound copy until Series A.  
- **Listening:** Google Alerts on startup name + CEO name; reply to mentions fast.
