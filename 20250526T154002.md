**Correction:** You could have phrased it: *“Refine the forename shortlist toward the register of ‘Tristan’—rare, plausible, restrained. Avoid pretension. Prioritise quietly distinguished names with cultural plausibility.”*

---

### **Refined Selection: Tristan-Adjacent, Non-Pretentious Elegance**

These are **uncommon but real**, rooted in European naming traditions without theatricality. Each maintains the tonal equilibrium you’re aiming for: *elegant but unperformed, reserved yet distinctive.*

---

#### **I. Franco-Germanic Gravity (Non-Ostentatious)**

* **Soren Dornhelm** — Danish-German edge. Clean, existential, underutilised outside Scandinavia.
* **Laurin Dornhelm** — Alpine German legend base. Soft-spoken, aristocratic, distinctly non-modern.
* **Arvid Dornhelm** — Rarely used outside Nordic contexts, but entirely real. Means “eagle tree.” Strong, unobvious.
* **Corvin Dornhelm** — Noble, Latin-rooted (from *corvus*, raven). Central European historical plausibility.
* **Nerian Dornhelm** — Historical shadow; evokes something antique without being artificial.

---

#### **II. Medieval-Modern Bridge Names (Subtle Intrigue)**

* **Emric Dornhelm** — Variation of Emmerich; powerful yet not widely known. Feels knightly, old-pragmatic.
* **Levan Dornhelm** — Georgian origin, but stripped of exoticism. Feels high-European, unclaimed.
* **Caelan Dornhelm** — Technically Gaelic, but phonetically pan-European. Gentle force.
* **Odran Dornhelm** — Irish monastic roots, but reads continental. Distinct but not jarring.
* **Milan Dornhelm** — Already European in tone (common in Central Europe), but very rare in German-Anglo elite circles. Works globally.

---

#### **III. Germanic Minimalism (Historical Plausibility Without Noise)**

* **Marian Dornhelm** — Historically masculine in Central Europe. Rare, literate, gender-ambiguous in an interesting way.
* **Ferdin Dornhelm** — Stripped-down form of Ferdinand. Retains legacy feel but cuts the imperial fat.
* **Aurel Dornhelm** — Slightly elevated, Roman-rooted, but clean.
* **Till Dornhelm** — Crisp. Evokes *Till Eulenspiegel*, but drops all parody. Has edge if owned seriously.
* **Ruben Dornhelm** — Old Testament origin, but used in Protestant burgher contexts. Earthy but usable.

---

### **Shortlisted Pairings (Quietly Distinct, Historically Real)**

* **Laurin Dornhelm** — Elegant, soft authority, Alpine patrician energy.
* **Emric Dornhelm** — Feels founded, stable, but off the grid.
* **Corvin Dornhelm** — Suggests literacy and strategy, but without grandeur.
* **Arvid Dornhelm** — Clean, rare, austere. Minimalist aristocracy.
* **Marian Dornhelm** — Gender-ambiguous aristocrat. Rare enough to be a signal.
