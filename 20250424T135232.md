*Correction → Clearer wording might have been:*  
> “Forge a **single, coherent talent-architecture** that welds together the Officer ladder, the Specialist & Innovation skill-tracks, and the assignment taxonomy into one meritocratic, up-or-out operating system. The result must reward A-players, inculcate ACM culture, and guarantee that the best ascend while the rest recycle or exit.”

## I / Prime Design Principles  

1. **One Company—Three Career Orbits, One Gravitation**  
   – *Command*, *Expert*, *Venture* tracks share identical promotion gates and evaluation math.  
2. **Assignment ≠ Career**  
   – You *rotate* through assignments; you *progress* through grades.  
3. **Up-or-Out Clock**  
   – Fixed “dwell limits” in each grade: pass the gate or revert to lower-pressure track / exit.  
4. **Culture as Curriculum**  
   – Every grade jump requires completion of **ACM Academy** modules + live mission tour.  
5. **Transparent Scorecard**  
   – Three-axis quantitative rubric; promotion boards publish anonymised tallies.

## II / Unified Grade Lattice (“Eupator Talent Matrix”)  

| **Band** | **Command Track** | **Expert Track** | **Venture Track** | **Dwell-Limit** |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **G-0** | Probe Officer (AMU Lead) | Probe Specialist | Probe Innovator | 2 missions |
| **G-1** | Field Officer (LFO) | Senior Specialist | Innovation Pilot | 6 quarters |
| **G-2** | Senior Field Officer (Task-Force Cmdr) | Principal Expert | Venture Captain (Spin-out GM) | 8 quarters |
| **G-3** | Staff Officer (AGS Cell Chief) | Distinguished Expert | Venture Architect (Portfolio Dir.) | 10 quarters |
| **G-4** | Senior Staff Officer / Command XO | Fellow | Venture General Partner | 12 quarters |
| **G-5** | Council Member | n/a* | n/a* | open |

\* Fellows and VGPs may receive *ex-officio* Council seats when elected.

**Dwell-Limit** = maximum time in-grade; failure to promote triggers Forced Pivot review: lateral shift, demotion, or exit.

## III / Assignment Classes (Where Grades Operate)

| Assignment | Typical Grade Span | Tenure | Purpose |
|------------|--------------------|--------|---------|
| **Core Mission** (AMU, Group, TF) | G-0 → G-2 | Mission horizon | Tactical delivery |
| **Staff Posting** (AGS, ICC) | G-1 → G-3 | 4–12 mo | Doctrine, planning |
| **OCD Line** | G-0 → G-3 (Experts mainly) | Indefinite | Continuity services |
| **Flash Cell** | Any | ≤72 h | Crisis response |
| **Advisory** | G-2+ or external | Episodic | Non-binding counsel |
| **Partner-AMU** | Mixed | Contract | Outsourced sub-mission |

Assignments are *rotational*; grades are *permanent* (until promotion/demotion).

## IV / Promotion Mechanics (One Math for All)

### 1. **Tri-Axis Score (0-100 each)**  
| Axis | Weight | Data Inputs |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Mission Impact** | 45 % | KR attainment %, budget delta, cycle time |
| **Doctrine Contribution** | 30 % | AAR adoption count, playbook citations, patents |
| **Leader Effect** | 25 % | Team eNPS, attrition, psychological-safety index |

> Passing Gate = weighted composite ≥ 80 + Board vote.

### 2. **Quarterly Promotion Boards**  
– Chaired by AGS Chief + cross-track peers.  
– Blind dossiers → deliberation → public promotion bulletin.

### 3. **Up-or-Out Execution**  
– At dwell-limit minus one quarter, candidate flagged “amber.”  
– If subsequent Board denies promotion → Forced Pivot panel within 30 days.

## V / ACM Academy (Mandatory Curriculum per Grade)

| Grade Gate | Core Modules | Capstone |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| G-0 → G-1 | Mission Economics, Feedback Loops, ACM Culture | Live mission “Blue-Red” debrief |
| G-1 → G-2 | Task-Force Finance, Talent Multiplication, Systems Thinking | Shadow-command a TF for 2 sprints |
| G-2 → G-3 | Strategy Craft, Scenario Wargaming, Stakeholder Capitalism | Write & defend a Doctrine Addendum |
| G-3 → G-4 | Portfolio Governance, Ethical Power, Public-Company Readiness | Lead Enterprise-wide exercise |
| G-4 → G-5 | Stewardship Colloquium, Macro-Risk Lab | Council peer review |

Completion recorded in **Academy Database** (Notion relation to People).

## VI / Cross-Track Transfers (The “Oscillation Charter”)

| Entry Condition | Required Bridge Tour |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Expert ➞ Command | 2 missions as Probe Officer |
| Command ➞ Expert | 6-month deep-tech sabbatical; publish whitepaper |
| Any ➞ Venture | 1 Innovation Pilot mission + validated MVP |
| Venture ➞ Command | Show profitable spin-out + LFO shadow tour |

Max 2 oscillations in any 36-month window.

---

## VII / In-Workflow Implementation (Notion & Automation)

1. **People DB** → property **Grade** (select) + **Board-Score** (formula).  
2. **Quarterly Script** (Zapier) → pull KR metrics, eNPS survey, AAR citations → autopopulate Board scorecards.  
3. **Promotion Board Page** → linked view of candidates with board-score ≥ 75 (pre-read).  
4. **Auto-Flag** “Amber” status at dwell-limit – 90 days.  
5. **Career Pivot Kanban** tracks transitions, sabbaticals, exits.

## VIII / Why This Unification Satisfies Meritocracy & “Commander Culture”

1. **Singular Metric Engine** – Everyone, irrespective of craft, ascends via the same transparent tri-axis score.  
2. **Up-or-Out Cadence** – Mediocrity is time-boxed; the organisation constantly renews its A-player quota.  
3. **Cross-Pollination** – Oscillation Charter prevents silo ossification and fertilises doctrine with fresh viewpoints.  
4. **Officer Corps Backbone** – Command track shoulders cultural stewardship and venture catalysis while Specialists and Innovators fuel depth and novelty.  
5. **Doctrine-Learning Loop** – Mandatory AAR adoption and Academy outputs bake culture into artefacts, not folklore.

Hence Eupator (or any ACM entity) becomes a **“company of commanders”**: talent flows through a clear lattice, excellence is mathematically surfaced, and the organisation continuously sharpens itself on the whetstone of transparent, rhythmic evaluation.
