**Correction:** "Which domains and handles should I secure?" would have been more grammatically precise.

### Priority Digital Real Estate for Persona Consolidation: _Tristan Dornhelm_

#### 1. **Domain Hierarchy (By Strategic Value)**

| Priority | Domain | Rationale | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **1** | `dornhelm.com` | Root asset. Clean, authoritative, ownable. Anchor for all brand activity. | 
| **2** | `tristandornhelm.com` | Defensive registration. Captures direct lookups from full-name recall. | 
| **3** | `dornhelm.co` / `dornhelm.io` | Optional, tech-leaning or design-centric extensions. Useful for spinouts or concept projects. | 
| **4** | `dornhelm.xyz` | Low-cost future hedge. Signals crypto/web3 adjacency if ever needed. | 
| **5** | Common misspellings | If applicable, capture typosquats (e.g. _dornhelm.net_, _dornhelm.org_) depending on capital. | 

**Action:** Secure _dornhelm.com_ immediately. Price is irrelevant if you're serious. It's your root identity namespace.

#### 2. **Social Handle Control Grid**

| Platform | Handle to Secure | Notes | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Instagram | `@dornhelm` or `@tristandornhelm` | Visual presence, even if dormant. Needed for brand symmetry. | 
| X / Twitter | `@dornhelm` or `@t_dornhelm` | Intellectual authority. Can remain low-activity but must exist. | 
| LinkedIn | `linkedin.com/in/tristandornhelm` | Minimum credible professional profile. Use for credibility laundering. | 
| YouTube | `@dornhelm` | Even if unused. Future-proofing for long-form or talks. | 
| TikTok | `@dornhelm` | Optional. Only if you foresee culture-facing activity. | 
| Substack | `dornhelm.substack.com` | Thought leadership, essays, investor letters--if relevant. | 
| GitHub | `dornhelm` | If technical output is involved at any point. | 
| Mastodon / Farcaster / Warpcast | `@dornhelm` | Optional hedge. Web3-native audiences may expect presence. | 

**Handle Strategy:**

- Aim for `@dornhelm` wherever possible for elegance and uniformity.
- Fall back to `@tristandornhelm` if short form is taken.
- Avoid numerical suffixes or hyphenation.

### Additional Tactical Recommendations

- **Trademark Check:** Run a preliminary check on _Dornhelm_ for any active trademarks, especially in consulting, media, or tech.
- **Email Infrastructure:** Secure `hello@dornhelm.com`, `press@`, `contact@`, `td@`--these signal maturity even if inactive.
- **Gravatar / Avatar Cohesion:** Register Gravatar to control visual presence across platforms that auto-pull it (e.g. WordPress, Disqus).
- **Favicon + Minimal Brand Assets:** Even a static landing page at `dornhelm.com` with high-aesthetic minimalism creates brand asymmetry.
