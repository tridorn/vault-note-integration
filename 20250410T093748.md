You’re right. What I gave you was too even, too generic—lacking the **structural granularity** necessary for true modular design. You don’t want thematic categories. You want **clearly delineated, discrete operational components**, each functioning like a **plug-in module**, capable of being built, replaced, scaled, or automated independently.

Let’s rearchitect this from the ground up.

---

## **The Modular Company Architecture (MCA)**  
> A layered, decomposed operating system made of discrete, interoperable components—each rational, forward-compatible, and fully swappable.

---

## **Layer 1: Foundational Layer**  
> *Establishes the existence and sovereign logic of the entity.*

| Component            | Function                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Identity.Registry`   | Name, legal entity, domain, registration data |
| `Mission.Statement`   | Why it exists—non-changing, purpose-rooted    |
| `Thesis.Vector`       | What space it moves in—changeable trajectory  |
| `Governance.Chart`    | Control logic: who decides, who owns what     |
| `Founder's Clause`    | Core, inviolable doctrines                    |
| `Legal.Structure`     | GmbH, LLC, UG, trust, foundation, etc.        |

---

## **Layer 2: Strategic Layer**  
> *Defines directional intent and resource alignment.*

| Component               | Function                                             |

| `Kill.Criterion`         | When something gets shut down / reabsorbed          |

---

## **Layer 3: Intelligence Layer**  
> *Captures knowledge, observations, and decisions.*

| Component               | Function                                              |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

| `Archive.Book`           | Long-form reflection, usually post-mortem             |

---

## **Layer 4: Execution Layer**  
> *Turns knowledge and strategy into structured action.*

| Component              | Function                                                  |

## **How You Use This**

### **To Build From Scratch**
You go **layer by layer**, module by module:
- Layer 1 → Incorporate, define identity and governance
- Layer 2 → Declare strategy and create Mission Cards
- Layer 3 → Build intelligence memory with Decision Logs + Research Dossiers
- Layer 4 → Begin operating with Method Maps and Execution Paths
- Layer 5 → Hire and onboard with Role Cards and Org Rings
- etc.

### **To Audit or Refactor an Existing Business**
You ask:  
**“Do we have an Offer.Card?”**  
**“Where is our Access.Grid defined?”**  
**“Do our Decision.Logs exist?”**

You don’t fix everything at once. You fix **what’s missing**.

## **What Makes This Different**

| Quality                | MCA Delivers                                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Modular**            | Each component can be independently added/replaced |
| **Forward-Compatible** | AI agents, automation, and fractional roles ready  |
| **Replaceable**        | Nothing is sacred—components can be forked or killed |
| **Composable**         | Build with what you need, skip the rest           |
| **Replicable**         | Can be copied across ventures or scaled into templates |

Would you like me to:
- Build this as an interactive **Notion-based Company Generator** with templates per component?
- Design a **visual systems map** (poster-style) that shows how these components interlock?
- Create a **self-audit checklist**, 1 row per module, with "exists/clear/incomplete" fields?

Pick your interface—and we bring the stack alive.
