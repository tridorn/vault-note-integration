Below is a “decision matrix” that experienced shorthand users, court reporters, and journalists usually run through.  Read it once, circle the factors that matter most to you, and you’ll know which path to commit to for the next decade of daily note-taking.

Key factor	Pen-shorthand front-runners	Machine-shorthand front-runner
Top sustainable speed	Gregg (>120 wpm proven)  ￼  Teeline (100-120 wpm in newsroom practice)  ￼	Stenotype (180 wpm exam minimum; 225-375 wpm common for pros)  ￼ ￼
Learning curve to 60 wpm (≈fast handwriting)	Teeline ≈ 6-8 weeks  Gregg Simplified ≈ 3-4 months	Steno (Plover + hobby board) ≈ 4-6 months
Read-back months or years later	Teeline easiest (alphabet cues)  Gregg good if you keep practising  Pitman excellent but requires thick/thin strokes and special pens  ￼ ￼	Excellent—your output is already digital text
Portability / zero electronics	✅ (any notebook & smooth pen)	❌ need a stenotype or NKRO keyboard + laptop/tablet
Community & modern learning material	Gregg and Teeline both have active online groups, free PDFs, YouTube drills	Plover project offers free software, Discord support, kits from ≈€120  ￼ ￼
Ceiling if you later want professional-grade speed	Gregg can break 150 wpm, but >180 wpm is rare. Pitman historically hit 200 wpm with huge effort.	Designed for 200-300 wpm; scales indefinitely

Rational recommendation

1. Primary tool: Gregg Shorthand – Simplified edition (1955)

Why this version?
	•	Speed headroom: 120–150 wpm is reachable for non-reporters; that’s double a fast longhand hand.  ￼
	•	Balanced memory load: Simplified cut the brief-form list in half compared to the older “Anniversary” version, so you can reach working speed months sooner without losing the elegant flow that makes Gregg fast.  ￼
	•	No special pen pressure: Unlike Pitman you never worry about thick/thin strokes—any smooth roller-ball or fountain pen will do.
	•	Abundant modern resources: Free scanned manuals, Anki decks, and an active community site (gregg-shorthand.com) mean you’re never stuck for material.  ￼

Bottom line: If you’ll be filling pages every day on ordinary paper, Gregg Simplified maximises long-term speed and practicality.

2. Secondary fall-back: Teeline

Choose Teeline only if ultra-fast ramp-up overtakes raw speed on your priority list. Journalists regularly hit 100 wpm after a few months, and its quasi-alphabetic outlines are easier to read cold.  ￼

3. Future-proof add-on: Plover machine shorthand

If, a year from now, you discover you’re still losing ideas because your hand can’t keep up, bolt a €120 hobby stenoboard to your laptop and learn Plover. You’ll type in chords at >180 wpm and everything will land straight into a text file—perfect for archiving or searching.  ￼ ￼

How to commit (without wasting effort)
	1.	Buy or print “The Gregg Shorthand Manual Simplified” (2nd ed.). Keep the book open beside your notebook.
	2.	Daily ladder: 15 min theory + 15 min dictation drill. At ~Unit 30 (6-7 weeks) you’ll already outpace longhand.
	3.	Monthly review page: once a month, re-read a random older page. If you can’t instantly decode 95 %, slow down new theory until readability sticks.
	4.	Decision checkpoint at 6 months:
	•	If you’re ≥100 wpm and happy—stay with Gregg.
	•	If you crave more speed—layer in Plover evenings; your Gregg muscle memory won’t interfere.

Final word

For a paper-first, English-only workflow, Gregg Simplified is the most rational long-run choice: fastest sustainable pen system, huge resource base, zero specialised gear.  Keep Teeline as “plan B” for quick onboarding, and remember Plover exists if you ever hit your ceiling and want to rocket past it.
