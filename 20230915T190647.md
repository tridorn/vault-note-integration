# Workout swimming

## Warm up

### Light Cardio

Swim a few easy laps

### Dynamic stretching

1. **Arm Circles**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and extend your arms straight out to your sides at shoulder height. Start making small circles with your arms, gradually increasing the size of the circles. After 15-30 seconds, reverse the direction of the circles. This exercise targets your shoulder joints and warms up the muscles around them.

2. **Shoulder Swings**: Stand upright and swing one arm forward as if you were doing a freestyle stroke, but without the body rotation. Repeat for 15-30 seconds, then switch arms. This warms up the muscles involved in your swimming stroke.

3. **Torso Twists**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, lift your arms up with elbows bent so your hands are at chest level. Gently twist your torso to one side, then the other, keeping your hips facing forward. Do this for about 30 seconds. This helps to warm up your core and lower back.

4. **Hip Circles**: Stand with your hands on your hips, feet shoulder-width apart. Move your hips in a circular motion, as if you were hula hooping. Do this for 15-30 seconds, then switch directions. This helps to loosen up the hips, which are crucial for proper swimming form.

5. **Leg Swings**: Hold onto a wall or rail for balance, stand on one leg and swing the other leg forward and backward in a controlled manner. Do this for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs. This helps to warm up your hip flexors and glutes.

6. **Ankle Circles**: While holding onto a wall or rail for balance, lift one foot off the ground and rotate the ankle in a circular motion. Do this for 15-30 seconds, then switch directions and feet. Ankles need to be flexible for effective kicking.

7. **Squats**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and then lower your body as if sitting back into a chair. Keep your back straight, your knees over your feet, and your weight on your heels. Rise back to a standing position. Do this for about 15-30 seconds. Squats are good for activating your lower body, particularly your quads and glutes.

## Main workout

Here's a beginner swimming workout to help improve your freestyle form and build endurance. Remember to maintain a comfortable, moderate pace to promote recovery.

**Set 1: Technique Drills (4 x 50 meters)**
- Start with 4 laps of technique drills, with 30 seconds rest in between each lap.
- Drill 1 (2 laps): **Finger-Tip Drag Drill** - As you recover your arm above the water, drag your fingertips across the surface of the water. This helps improve arm recovery form.
- Drill 2 (2 laps): **Catch-Up Drill** - Begin with both arms extended in front of you. Start a stroke with one arm, but don't begin a stroke with the other arm until the first one has 'caught up'. This drill helps improve stroke timing and reduces cross-body movement.

**Set 2: Pull and Kick Focused (4 x 50 meters)**
- The second set focuses on strengthening the pull and kick, with 30 seconds rest between each lap.
- Lap 1-2: **Pull Focused** - Hold a pull buoy between your thighs (if available, otherwise just focus on pulling more). This isolates your arms by minimizing your kick. Concentrate on your arm technique.
- Lap 3-4: **Kick Focused** - If you have a kickboard, hold it in front of you and kick. If not, simply kick with your hands extended. This focuses on your kick and lower body.

**Set 3: Full Stroke (4 x 50 meters)**
- The third set is freestyle swimming with 30 seconds rest in between each lap. Focus on integrating everything together, maintaining good form throughout.

**Set 4: Cooldown (2 x 50 meters)**
- Finish with 2 slow, relaxed laps. This is to cool down and help start the recovery process.

This workout totals 700 meters. Remember to keep your focus on technique, especially during the drills, and adjust the lengths to fit your fitness level and swimming ability. As your technique and stamina improve, you can increase the length of each set or reduce the rest periods between laps.

## Cooldown

### Light cardio

Go to the outside area and swim around.

### Static stretching

1. **Shoulder Stretch**: Extend one arm straight out in front of you at shoulder height. Bend your elbow and place your hand on the side of your neck or upper back. With your other hand, gently pull the elbow towards the midline of your body until you feel a stretch in your shoulder. Hold for 20-30 seconds and then repeat with the other arm.

2. **Tricep Stretch**: Raise one arm straight up, then bend your elbow to place your hand on your upper back, reaching as far down as comfortable. Use your other hand to gently press down on the bent elbow. You should feel a stretch in your tricep and into your shoulder. Hold for 20-30 seconds, then switch arms.

3. **Chest Stretch**: Stand in a doorway or corner of the pool with your arms bent at a right angle. Place your forearms against the wall. Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your chest and front of your shoulders. Hold for 20-30 seconds.

4. **Quadricep Stretch**: Stand on one foot and pull the other foot up towards your buttock, keeping knees together and pushing your hips forward. Use a wall for balance if needed. Hold for 20-30 seconds and then switch legs.

5. **Hamstring Stretch**: Extend one leg in front of you, heel on the pool floor, toes pointing upward, and the other leg slightly bent. Slowly bend forward from the hip until you feel a stretch in the back of your extended leg. Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders. Hold for 20-30 seconds, then switch legs.

6. **Calf Stretch**: Stand arm's length from a wall, place your right foot behind your left foot. Slowly bend your left leg forward, keeping your right knee straight and your right heel on the ground. Lean into the wall until you feel a stretch in the back of your right leg. Hold for 20-30 seconds, then switch sides.

7. **Hip Flexor Stretch**: Stand with one foot in front of the other. Bend your front knee until you feel a stretch in the hip of the back leg. Keep your torso upright and push your hips forward. You may want to use the pool wall for balance. Hold for 20-30 seconds, then switch legs.
