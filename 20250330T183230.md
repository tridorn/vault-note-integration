**HOUSE EUPATOR**  
**CHARTER OF COMPARTMENTALIZATION**  
*Vol. I — Law of Isolation, Resilience, and Silent Continuity*

---

## **Preamble**

To endure is to be distributed.  
To grow without collapsing is to divide without dissolving.

This Charter exists to encode the principle that **no unit, no person, no protocol within the House shall ever possess the full shape of the House.** Knowledge must be partial. Access must be gated. Proximity must be earned.

> *“The limb knows how to move, not why the body moves.”*

This is not distrust. It is **discipline**.  
Compartmentalization ensures that the House may grow large and deep **without exposure, infiltration, or fragility.**

---

## **Article I — The Law of Domains**

The House is divided across **three compartmentalized domains**:

### 1.1 **Informational Domain**
- All knowledge is tiered according to clearance.
- No document, archive, or codex shall be accessible in full to any member below the Praetorian Core.
- Segmented Vaults (Outer / Middle / Inner) shall be used for data storage, each with unique authentication protocols.

### 1.2 **Functional Domain**
- All missions are executed by independent units (Cells).
- Each Cell is to operate autonomously, with no lateral awareness of other Cells.
- Commands flow **vertically** only, unless exception is granted by the Core.

### 1.3 **Social Domain**
- Members shall know only those others with whom their duties require interaction.
- Identities are not to be revealed across branches, unless granted under **Rite of Contact**.
- Personal, legal, and House identities must be kept separate.

---

## **Article II — Tiered Clearance Structure**

Each member of the House is assigned a **Clearance Tier**:

| Tier | Name        | Access |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 0    | Observer    | None; potential recruit |
| I    | Acolyte     | Cell-level functional knowledge |
| II   | Knight      | Regional or domain knowledge |
| III  | Steward     | Chapter-level strategic insight |
| IV   | Consul      | Cross-chapter operations |
| V    | Praetorian  | Full spectrum visibility |
| VI   | Primarch    | Total control; root access |

Tier advancement is not automatic and is gated by **Trial, Oath, and Confirmation**.

---

## **Article III — Operational Cells**

### 3.1 Mission Units
- Each mission shall be assigned to a **cell** of no more than 7 individuals.
- Cells are dissolved after mission closure.
- Each cell reports to a designated Steward or Consul.

### 3.2 Isolation Clause
- No cell may inquire into the activity of another.
- Breach of this clause constitutes **Espionage** and is subject to erasure.

---

## **Article IV — Data Sanctity Protocol**

### 4.1 Vault Segmentation
- The Memory Vault is segmented into:
  - **Outer Vault** — accessible to all members
  - **Middle Vault** — strategic documents, chapter protocols
  - **Inner Vault** — codices, succession documents, origin protocols

Each vault requires independent authentication. Access attempts are logged and sealed.

### 4.2 Ciphered Lore
- Certain documents may be disguised under fictional, poetic, or coded language.
- Deciphering rights are granted only by the Core.

---

## **Article V — Communication Protocols**

### 5.1 Identity Layering
- Each member must maintain three identities:
  - **Legal Identity** — used only for official paperwork, banking, and state engagement  
  - **Public Persona** — used in media, professional life, visible House activities  
  - **House Identity** — internal codename used in all House operations

These identities must **never fully overlap**.

### 5.2 Gated Channels
- Communication shall occur only on approved, encrypted platforms.
- Each Cell uses a separate platform and linguistic cipher.
- Inter-cell communication must be authorized under **Rite of Contact**.

---

## **Article VI — Access and Initiation**

### 6.1 The Rule of Ascent
- No individual may be granted Tier III+ clearance without:
  - Trial by Mission  
  - Oath of Loyalty  
  - Memory Review  
  - Confirmation by at least two Praetorians

### 6.2 The Shadow Path
- Some individuals will serve for years under limited context.
- They will not be told they are part of the House.
- This is by design. Their loyalty is proven in action, not ceremony.

---

## **Article VII — Counter-Infiltration Protocol**

### 7.1 Canary Operations
- Information given to new initiates is seeded with minor, trackable anomalies.
- Leaks will be traced by signature.

### 7.2 Loyalty Monitoring
- All active members undergo periodic review—operational, psychological, and ideological.
- Sudden changes in behavior, unexplained inquiries, or breach of silence are grounds for immediate suspension.

### 7.3 Deadman Locks
- Key protocols, vaults, and systems will lock and self-wipe upon unauthorized access or signal of capture.

---

## **Article VIII — Failure & Containment**

### 8.1 Failure Cascade
- Upon evidence of infiltration:
  - All compromised cells enter Dormant State.
  - Keys rotate. Vaults seal.
  - Communications reroute through fallback channels.

### 8.2 Silent Purge
- Members identified as compromised may be:
  - Downgraded  
  - Ghosted (cut from all systems)  
  - Publicly removed (only in extreme cases)  
  - Ritualistically erased from the Book of Names

No explanation is required. Silence is protection.

---

## **Article IX — Amendment & Enforcement**

- This Charter may only be amended by:
  - 100% consensus of the Praetorian Core  
  - Final approval from the Primarch  
  - Record entered into the Inner Vault, sealed with the Sigil Key

Any violation of this Charter, intentional or negligent, is considered **a breach of the Code**.

---

## **Final Clause: The Blind Architect**

The House does not need to be known to survive.  
It needs only to remember its shape, follow its Code, and speak its will.

Let the left hand never know the right.  
Let the world never see the whole.  
Let the seed grow unseen, until the forest cannot be cut.
