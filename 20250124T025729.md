Yes, you're absolutely right—while the **AMU Leader** has a critical role in guiding the team, the **rotation of leadership** based on phases (such as planning, execution, and review) is a key feature of the AMU structure. This rotation ensures that leadership isn't concentrated in one person throughout the mission but is **distributed based on expertise** and the evolving needs of the project.

### **1. Rotating Leadership: How it Works**

Rotating leadership based on the mission’s phase allows the team to benefit from **different skill sets** and leadership styles at different stages of the project. Here's how this might be structured:

- **Planning Phase**: The leader could be someone with strong **strategic thinking** or **project management skills**, capable of breaking down the mission into actionable steps, setting milestones, and coordinating resources.
- **Execution Phase**: The leader might be someone with expertise in the core functional area of the mission (e.g., a **technical expert** or product manager) to ensure smooth execution and real-time problem solving.
- **Review/Completion Phase**: The leader could be someone who excels in **analytical thinking** or **communication**, capable of collecting insights, facilitating retrospectives, and preparing final reports for leadership.

Rotating the lead based on the team member’s expertise keeps the mission **fluid and dynamic** and ensures that every phase has the right **kind of leadership** to drive success.

### **2. Ensuring All Team Members Understand the Broader Strategy**

To ensure that all team members—not just the initial leader—are aware of the **broader strategic implications** of the mission, there are several mechanisms in place:

#### **A. Strategic Briefings for the Entire Team**

While the **AMU Leader** receives initial strategic direction from the Leadership Council, it is critical that the **entire AMU team** participates in a **mission briefing**. This briefing should outline:

- The **long-term strategic goals** of the company.
- How the mission **aligns with the broader objectives**.
- Key **performance indicators (KPIs)** that measure success at both the mission level and how those KPIs contribute to company-level goals.

This ensures that every team member understands the **strategic importance** of the mission from the outset, regardless of who is currently leading the team.

#### **B. Involvement in Strategic Planning**

Even though leadership rotates, all team members should be involved in the **planning phase** to some extent. This collaborative process allows team members to:

- Understand the **full scope** of the mission and its impact.
- Offer input on how the mission should proceed, based on their own areas of expertise.
- Internalize the broader context so they can make informed decisions even when they aren't leading.

#### **C. Transparent Communication Channels**

**Continuous communication** across the team ensures that the strategy remains visible to everyone throughout the mission:
- **Regular check-ins and stand-ups**: Frequent meetings or stand-ups where the entire team reviews progress in light of the overall strategy.
- **Clear documentation**: Platforms like Trello, Asana, or Notion can host key strategic documents and mission briefs that everyone can access. This includes notes from the Leadership Council, strategic objectives, and ongoing KPIs.

#### **D. Leadership Coaching From LFOs**

**Leadership Field Officers (LFOs)** play a key role in ensuring that team members, especially those stepping into leadership roles during different phases, understand the strategic implications. They provide **mentorship** and **strategic oversight**, making sure that no matter who is leading, the team's actions remain aligned with the company's overall objectives.

#### **E. Peer Learning and Cross-Team Collaboration**

Rotating leadership fosters a culture of **peer learning** and **cross-collaboration**. Each team member is responsible for ensuring that they understand the broader strategy, not just in their immediate tasks but in how their work contributes to the mission’s larger objectives.

### **3. Ensuring Strategic Continuity Across Phases**

While leadership may rotate across phases, strategic continuity is maintained through a **combination of tools and processes**:

- **Shared Strategic Documents**: Every team member has access to strategic documentation, ensuring that they are always aware of the mission’s alignment with broader goals.
- **Feedback Loops**: Each time leadership rotates, there are formal feedback loops (check-ins, strategic reviews) that ensure the new leader is briefed on what has been done and what needs to happen next.
- **Mid-Mission Strategic Reviews**: Periodic strategic reviews with LFOs and key stakeholders ensure that even as leadership rotates, the team remains aligned with the **overall mission objectives** and broader strategic goals.

---

By rotating leadership and ensuring that **strategic knowledge** is shared and communicated throughout the AMU, you foster a team that is both **adaptive and aligned**. This structure avoids the common pitfall where only one person holds the strategic knowledge, ensuring that everyone contributes meaningfully to the company’s long-term vision.
