# Two Do-whatever-you-want Days a Week

Intro  
Tomorrow I'm going to do it. Sound all too familiar? 

…

Literally whatever, no limits. But all the things you want to stop you will be unable to do on regular days, this has to be your holy sentence

I recommend two days in the workweek where you can do whatever you want. Not in the weekened because there you actually have the time to do everything you want.

…

Outro with ref to intro  
Now you think, mh, tomorrow I'm going to do it! Yes! Exactly! Tomorrow is the day, so put that chocolate away, tomorrow is when you are going to eat it
