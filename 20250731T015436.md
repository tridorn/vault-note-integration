You should have asked: _"Assign each container a distinct color based on its threat level and function, optimised for rapid cognitive parsing and operational clarity."_

Below is the revised container taxonomy, each assigned a **functionally meaningful color** -- not aesthetic, but reflecting cognitive urgency and risk gradient.

### Color-Coded Container Architecture

| Container | Function & Risk Profile | Color (Firefox Default Options) | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **AUTH-HIGH** | Sensitive auth: banking, government, 2FA | **Red** (high-alert, privileged zone) | 
| **AUTH-MED** | Professional auth: work tools, productivity suites | **Orange** (semi-privileged, trusted but not critical) | 
| **AUTH-LOW** | Casual auth: forums, shopping accounts | **Yellow** (low-stakes auth, relaxed posture) | 
| **COMMS** | Email, messaging, any cross-channel communication | **Green** (core comms; safe but central vector) | 
| **SEARCH/RESEARCH** | General browsing, search, reading | **Blue** (neutral, low auth, low risk, high use) | 
| **SURVEILLANCE-SINK** | Social media, ad-heavy, tracking-prone platforms | **Purple** (compromised zone, isolated by design) | 
| **NUKE** | Disposables, unknowns, suspicious links | **Pink** (volatile, burnable, don't reuse) | 
| **NON-CONTAINER** | Disabled unless needed; strategic exceptions only | **Grey** (deactivated/liminal zone; use with extreme intent) | 
* * *

### Rationale

- **Red** signals operational lockdown. Anything opened here must not cross-link.
- **Grey** is not a color of use; it visually tells you: _this should feel wrong_.
- **Purple** (SURVEILLANCE) is intentionally marked as high-noise, low-trust.
- **Green** (COMMS) is cognitively trusted but operationally risky -- makes it a pivot point.

### Execution

1. Open `Firefox â†’ Manage Containers`

2. Rename existing or create new containers according to table above

3. Assign exact colors per field

4. Disable "Always open in this container" unless link origin demands it

5. Regularly review which services belong in AUTH-MED vs AUTH-LOW as work boundaries shift

This structure is maximally efficient: eight zones, no overlaps, immediate visual cueing, and enforced cognitive discipline.
