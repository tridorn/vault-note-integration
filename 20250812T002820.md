Correction: You should have asked: “What are the essential CLI commands and operators beyond navigation, and how do I remove a directory properly?”

⸻

Part I: Directory Removal

rm – Remove files and directories

rm file.txt               # remove file
rm -r folder/             # remove folder and contents recursively
rm -rf folder/            # force removal, no prompts (use with precision)

Example:

rm -r ~/Documents/ObsidianVault

Risk: rm -rf has no undo. Confirm the path before executing. Run ls first.

⸻

Part II: Core CLI Commands Worth Learning Immediately

These are high-leverage for working efficiently in terminal. Grouped by function.

⸻

File & Directory Manipulation

cp	Copy files or directories
mv	Move or rename
mkdir	Create a directory
touch	Create an empty file
stat	Show detailed metadata on file

Examples:

cp file1.txt file2.txt
mv file.txt archive/
mkdir newfolder
touch empty.txt
stat file.txt


⸻

Viewing Content

Command	Function
cat	Output file content (entirely)
less	Page through content interactively
head	Show first N lines
tail	Show last N lines (add -f to follow)
wc	Word/line/char count

Examples:

cat notes.md
less logs.txt
head -n 20 bigfile.txt
tail -f server.log
wc -l notes.md


⸻

System Inspection

Command	Function
whoami	Show current user
hostname	Show system name
df -h	Disk space usage
du -sh	Folder size
uptime	System uptime
top / htop	Show system resource usage

Example:

du -sh ~/Downloads


⸻

Text Search & Filters

Command	Function
grep	Search for patterns in files
find	Search for files by name/criteria
cut	Extract columns from text
awk / sed	Text manipulation

Examples:

grep "TODO" notes.md
find ~/Documents -name "*.md"
cut -d',' -f1 data.csv


⸻

File Permissions and Ownership

Command	Function
chmod	Change permissions
chown	Change ownership
ls -l	Shows permission string (drwxr-xr-x etc.)

You won’t need these often on Silverblue unless doing CLI scripting.

⸻

Package Management (Inside Toolbox)

Command	Function
sudo dnf install <pkg>	Install package
dnf search <term>	Search package
dnf remove <pkg>	Uninstall

Example:

sudo dnf install ripgrep


⸻

Archiving and Compression

Command	Function
tar -czf	Create .tar.gz archive
tar -xzf	Extract archive
zip/unzip	For .zip archives

Example:

tar -czf vault.tar.gz ObsidianVault/
unzip archive.zip


⸻

Operators and Shell Shortcuts

Symbol	Function	Example
>	Redirect output to file	ls > list.txt
>>	Append output to file	echo "log" >> log.txt
`	`	Pipe output into next command
&&	Run next only if previous succeeds	mkdir test && cd test
;	Run commands sequentially	cd test; ls
*	Wildcard	rm *.log


⸻

Summary: High-Priority Commands to Internalise
	•	cd, ls, pwd, rm -r
	•	cp, mv, mkdir, touch
	•	less, grep, find
	•	df -h, du -sh, top
	•	git clone, git pull, git commit (for your vault workflow)

Practice these on your real files. Don’t “learn” them abstractly—use them operationally. That’s the retention path.
