### **Solution Blueprint – “Green-Risk Intelligence Fabric”**

---

#### 1. Product Stack (“Five Interlocking Engines”)

1. **Data-Ingestion Spine** – open-banking APIs, ERP connectors and IoT/smart-meter feeds funnel raw financial, operational and energy-consumption data into the platform. Every artefact is hashed and time-stamped to create an immutable audit trail banks can cite during supervisory reviews.  ([The EBA publishes its final Guidelines on the management of ESG ...](https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-its-final-guidelines-management-esg-risks))  
2. **Taxonomy & Eligibility Engine** – a rules/ML hybrid that maps each expenditure line to EU Taxonomy, LMA Green-Loan Principles and the forthcoming voluntary EU Green-Loan label. When Brussels amends criteria, only the rules table changes; the data lake remains intact.   
3. **MRV Loop (Measurement-Reporting-Verification)** – continuous sensor + invoice reconciliation detects under-performance in real time and escalates remediation tickets to vendors; covenant checks move from annual PDF uploads to daily deltas.  
4. **Guarantee-Stack Orchestrator** – an API that auto-attaches KfW Umwelt, InnovFin, and InvestEU Sustainability guarantees, calculates residual LGD and pre-populates annexes the lender must file.   
5. **Risk-File Compiler** – generates a machine-readable dossier (JSON & human-legible PDF) aligned with the EBA’s 2025 ESG-risk file template; one-click export fulfills the *loan-origination and monitoring* guidelines.  ([[PDF] Final Report - European Banking Authority](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-01/fb22982a-d69d-42cc-9d62-1023497ad58a/Final%20Guidelines%20on%20the%20management%20of%20ESG%20risks.pdf))

#### 2. Stakeholder Workflows

**SME Owner (≅ 15-minute flow)**  
1. Digital ID + basic KYC.  
2. “Green Passport” wizard autofills taxonomy eligibility and subsidy/guarantee matches.  
3. Marketplace presents pre-costed retrofit packages with IRR, CO₂ savings and guarantee-adjusted APR.  
4. Selection locks pricing; application file is generated and pushed to lender dashboard.

**Vendor / Installer**  
* Onboarding: KYB, warranty history, and insurance proof.  
* Progress milestones signed via mobile app; sensor data unlocks escrow.  
* Performance slippage triggers automatic punch-list and, if unresolved, blacklists vendor.

**Lender**  
* Receives structured risk file + ESG evidence bundle; PD/LGD already adjusted for guarantee coverage.  
* Accept/reject API sends decision; term sheet returned to SME in the portal.  
* Post-funding, MRV feed updates internal risk systems; deviations trigger covenant alerts.

---

#### 3. User-Facing Surfaces

* **SME Portal** – plain-language scores and ROI calculators; compliance jargon abstracted away.  
* **Vendor Console** – milestone tracker, inventory finance line linked to project progress.  
* **Bank Dashboard / API** – push/pull; full audit logs; option to embed widgets in existing credit workstation.

---

#### 4. Tech & Governance Architecture

* **Cloud-native micro-services** (Kubernetes) hosted in EU sovereign cloud (GAIA-X compliant).  
* **Zero-trust** identity: OAuth2 + verifiable credentials for documents.  
* **Event-driven pipeline** (Kafka) to stream sensor data; ML models retrained nightly.  
* **Audit layer**: every data mutation produces an append-only ledger entry, exportable as WORM archive for ECB audits.  
* **Data rights**: SMEs own raw data; platform retains derivative analytics under perpetual licence—lock-in without over-reach.

#### 5. Monetisation & Moat Enforcement

1. **Origination fee (1–2 %)** – banks pay; less than their average SME acquisition CAC.  
2. **Subscription** – SMEs purchase “ever-green compliance” updates; fee ratchets whenever EU widens taxonomy scope.  
3. **Data services** – anonymised performance curves sold to reinsurers for climate-risk pricing—competitors cannot replicate without longitudinal MRV data.

Switching costs escalate quadratically with portfolio size because banks would need to re-validate historical ESG evidence to leave the platform.

#### 6. Execution Milestones

* **M-0 → M-3:** Integrate open-banking, ERP and smart-meter connectors; ship SME onboarding MVP.  
* **M-4 → M-6:** Live pilots with one Landesbank and five vetted retrofit vendors; close ≥10 loans.  
* **M-7 → M-12:** Attach InvestEU guarantee layer; publish default-probability reduction study; raise Series A priced on data-network effects.

### **Essence**

Your product is **not** a loan marketplace; it is the *regulatory evidence rail* that transforms messy SME data into capital-grade, guarantee-enhanced assets.  Own the compliance bottleneck, and every euro of green lending must transit your fabric.
