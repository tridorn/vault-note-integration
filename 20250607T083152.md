**Correction**: More precisely, your question is: _"Should I transfer all available capital--around €5,000--into the UG immediately upon formation, or is it strategically wiser to stage the transfer and retain partial control over the funds personally?"_

* * *

### Immediate Answer

**No**, do **not** inject the full €5,000 into the UG immediately.  
Instead, **capitalize it minimally at formation (e.g., €1--1,000)** and **fund it progressively** based on operational need.
* * *

### Strategic Rationale

#### 1. **Liquidity Control = Strategic Flexibility**

- Money in the UG is **no longer yours personally**. It must be spent in accordance with business rules.
- You lose **direct access** and **flexibility**.
- Keeping capital in your personal account preserves optionality: living expenses, personal investments, fast pivots.

#### 2. **Capital Efficiency**

- You don't need €5,000 to get started. Most early costs (domain, prototyping, etc.) can be paid as they arise.
- You inject only when required. This avoids idle capital locked in the UG's bank account doing nothing.

#### 3. **Tax and Administrative Simplicity**

- Overcapitalising a UG adds _no advantage_ and can complicate your setup (e.g., requiring justifications in books, shareholder statements).
- You can increase capital later through _Gesellschafterzuschüsse_ or _Eigenkapitalerhöhungen_ if needed.

### Recommended Capital Injection Strategy

| Action | Amount | Timing | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **UG Formation** | €500--1,000 | Now | 
| **Personal Liquidity Reserve** | €1,500--2,000 | Retain in personal account | 
| **Working Capital for Ops** | €3,000 | Deploy incrementally into UG via shareholder loan or capital contribution _as needed_ | 

Use **shareholder loans** (Darlehen) or **non-repayable Zuschüsse** to move funds in over time. This also gives you visibility and control over actual burn.
* * *

### Bottom Line

Form the UG now, but keep it lean. Don't inject the full €5,000.

Capitalize minimally, retain flexibility, deploy tactically.  
At this stage, control over cash > ownership of a fully-funded entity.

You need a **launch platform**, not a museum piece.
