Excellent question—and the answer reveals why shorthand is actually ideal for your use case.

⸻

🔁 Misconception: Shorthand is just for transcription

Most people associate shorthand with court reporters or journalists frantically scribbling down someone else’s words. That’s where it shines, yes—but not where it ends.

⸻

✅ Truth: Shorthand works equally well for composing, reflecting, and thinking

When you’re thinking on paper—brainstorming, processing, making connections—you’re doing three things at once:
	1.	Capturing fleeting thoughts
	2.	Structuring them
	3.	Keeping up with your brain speed

Shorthand is specifically designed to support that trio:

⸻

🧠 1. Speed supports cognition

Cognitive science shows that when you’re trying to write full sentences, your working memory gets overloaded. You’re:
	•	recalling the idea
	•	constructing grammar
	•	spelling
	•	forming letters

Shorthand strips away most of that. Instead of “The main thing I need to address is…” you might write:

✦ main → addr ⇨

Which lets your brain stay focused on the idea, not the sentence.

⸻

🔎 2. It enables exploratory writing

Think of shorthand as a cognitive sketchpad, not a finished essay. You can:
	•	Jump between thoughts without transitions
	•	Capture nuances like tone/emphasis (underline, symbols, positioning)
	•	Create nested structures on the fly
	•	Invent your own symbols (Gregg is flexible that way)

It’s more notational than narrative. You aren’t writing “what you think”—you’re sketching how you think.

⸻

🛠️ 3. It invites personal systems

People who use shorthand for exploratory work often develop hybrids:
	•	Mixing in symbols: → ⇨ ✧ ★ ⊕
	•	Making their own abbreviations for common mental moves:
	•	q/ for questions
	•	r/ for reflections
	•	∆ for change
	•	Using spacing/layout as part of the meaning

These become part of your personal visual language, like a second syntax.

⸻

✍️ 4. Gregg in particular supports fluid composition

Gregg isn’t just about copying—it was explicitly designed for fast original composition. Its early business courses trained people to:
	•	Take dictation and write memos or letters
	•	Draft ideas without lifting the pen
	•	Use “brief forms” that are semantically dense

You’ll find the system naturally supports inner monologue and branching thoughts.

⸻

📘 Real-world parallel

Writers like David Allen (Getting Things Done) and Ryder Carroll (Bullet Journal) treat free-form note-taking as a kind of personal operating system. If they’d had shorthand fluency, it’d simply supercharge that same system—more signal, less friction.

⸻

🚀 Summary

Question	Answer
Can shorthand support idea-generation, not just recording others?	Yes. That’s one of its superpowers.
Is it usable mid-process (not just after I’ve figured things out)?	Yes—especially for ambiguous, messy, evolving thoughts.
Will it restrict my freedom or expressiveness?	No—it removes formality, adds speed, and opens space.


⸻

If you’re writing all day to think, not just to record, then shorthand—particularly something smooth and flexible like Gregg Simplified—is not only a fit. It’s likely the most frictionless tool you haven’t yet mastered.
