**Preferred wording of your query:**  
"Identify and compare routers that can act as a single, scriptable Wi-Fi client (to automate captive-portal log-ins) and wired gateway for my devices within the EU market. Recommend the one that best balances cost, capability, and longevity."

### 1 Non-negotiable technical criteria

| Capability | Rationale | Minimum spec | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Full OpenWrt (or equivalent) with root shell** | Required for cron-based captive-portal script | ≥ 16 MB flash / ≥ 128 MB RAM | 
| **Dual radio, 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) preferred** | Survives congested dorm airtime for years | 2×2 802.11ac acceptable, 802.11ax ideal | 
| **≥ 1 Gb LAN port** | Provides wired feed to the desktop | 1 × Gigabit | 
| **Low idle draw (< 8 W)** | Important in student housing where sockets are few | < 10 W | 

Routers falling short (e.g. TP-Link TL-WR902AC, 8 MB / 64 MB flash-RAM) are excluded. ([openwrt.org](https://openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr902ac_v3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **GL.iNet GL-MT3000 "Beryl AX"** | 512 MB / 256 MB | AX3000 (2×2 ax) | 1 G LAN + 2.5 G WAN | ≈ 90 € ([store-us.gl-inet.com](https://store-us.gl-inet.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooqcELJif41Qrn8RsIO-Yo9-KErjfyTvfULILrjhy9Ln-TcMCKy&utm_source=chatgpt.com), [gl-inet.com](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt3000/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Root shell, cron, proven captive-portal guide ([docs.gl-inet.com](https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/3/tutorials/connect_to_a_hotspot_with_captive_portal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | < 8 W draw; pocket size | 
| **GL.iNet GL-AXT1800 "Slate AX"** | 512 MB / 256 MB | AX1800 (2×2 ax) | 1 G LAN + 1 G WAN | ≈ 130 € ([store-eu.gl-inet.com](https://store-eu.gl-inet.com/collections/travel-routers?srsltid=AfmBOoqo7MYp6d1ZV8SMTPM7tHx3WnSbzdaD8ahVX3voi0OmMiuIAQBH&utm_source=chatgpt.com), [gl-inet.com](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-axt1800/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Same automation path; slightly larger chassis | Adds second Ethernet port; VPN throughput ↑ | 
| **GL.iNet GL-AR750S "Slate"** | 128 MB / 16 MB | AC750 (2×2 ac) | 3 × 1 G | ≈ 60 € ([gl-inet.com](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-ar750s/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Still scriptable; hardware ceiling low | Flash/RAM barely adequate for future packages | 
| MikroTik hAP ax lite | 256 MB / 128 MB | 2.4 GHz ax only | 1 G | ≈ 70 € | OpenWrt support still experimental ([forum.openwrt.org](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/adding-openwrt-support-for-the-mikrotik-hap-ax-lite/155926?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | RouterOS shell powerful but steeper learning | 
| ExpressVPN Aircove GO | 512 MB / 256 MB | AX3000 | 1 G | ≈ 160 € + subscription ([lifewire.com](https://www.lifewire.com/expressvpn-aircove-go-8609136?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Locked to vendor firmware; subscription drag | Over-priced for use-case |

### 3 Trade-off analysis

_Performance headroom._  
The captive-portal script itself is lightweight; what matters is longevity under firmware updates and optional VPN. Slate AX and Beryl AX both clear the 512 MB RAM bar, leaving ample headroom for WireGuard or AdGuard Home; Slate AX outperforms on raw VPN throughput but costs ~40 € more. ([gl-inet.com](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt3000/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [gl-inet.com](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-axt1800/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

_Physical ports._  
Your desktop needs a wired feed. Both AX models expose at least one gigabit LAN. Slate AX gives a second (gigabit) port via WAN-to-LAN switch; Beryl AX offers only one, but its WAN is 2.5 Gb and can be reassigned if ever required.

_Power & thermals._  
Beryl AX idles below 8 W ([gl-inet.com](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt3000/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)); Slate AX is similar in practice. MikroTik's USB-C powered unit is frugal but radio-limited (2.4 GHz only).

_Firmware maturity._  
GL.iNet ships a well-maintained OpenWrt fork with GUI and immediate root. Their captive-portal workflow is officially documented. ([docs.gl-inet.com](https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/3/tutorials/connect_to_a_hotspot_with_captive_portal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) MikroTik requires either RouterOS scripting (different syntax) or unofficial OpenWrt builds still in flux.

_Price discipline._  
Beryl AX delivers nearly Slate AX capability at a ~30 % lower outlay; AR750S saves another 30 €, but its 128 MB RAM will be a bottleneck by 2027.

### 4 Recommendation

Buy **GL.iNet GL-MT3000 "Beryl AX."**

- Why: Best cost-to-capability ratio; ample RAM/flash; documented captive-portal workflow; single USB-C power; silent; one 2.5 G+one 1 G port covers the desktop plus future NAS; firmware updated quarterly.
- How to deploy:

    1. Flash latest stable GL-MT3000 firmware (built on OpenWrt 23).

    2. In web UI set _Repeater_ to join the dorm SSID.

    3. SSH in, drop a curl-based login script (`/usr/bin/portal.sh`), and add a cron entry `@daily /usr/bin/portal.sh >/dev/null 2>&1`.

    4. Wire desktop to LAN port; leave Wi-Fi broadcast on for laptops/phones.

Total spend: < 100 €, payable once, zero recurring fees. The solution eliminates daily AGB clicks across all devices and gives you a private subnet with future VPN / DNS-filtering headroom.

If you later demand higher VPN throughput (>400 Mb/s) or dual LAN ports, upgrade to **Slate AX**; otherwise Beryl AX suffices for the next five-year horizon.
