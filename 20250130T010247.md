# Generalised Content of each IPO Step

Certainly! To adapt the **Input → Process → Output** framework into a more generalized, non-knowledge-specific context, here’s a **clear delineation of each step**, describing its purpose and what to put in each one.

---

### **1. Input: Capturing Raw Information**

**Purpose:**  
The Input step is for collecting and summarizing raw information, observations, or data that serve as the foundation for whatever you're working on. This is the "what" of your note—what is the source, context, or content you're engaging with?

**What to Put in Input:**
- **Descriptions of the situation, event, or task**:
  - What happened, what was observed, or what you need to address.
- **Lists of facts, details, or requirements**:
  - Example: "List of team members attending a meeting," "details of a workflow," "daily tasks."
- **Context**:
  - Where is this information coming from? What is its scope? Why is it relevant?
- **Raw data**:
  - If it’s a report, include figures, trends, or key takeaways.
  - For tasks, note what needs to be done.
- **Background Information**:
  - Any pre-existing knowledge or inputs necessary to understand the situation.

**Example (Event Planning):**

```
- Event: Annual Team Retreat
- Date: December 5-7, 2024
- Attendees: 15 team members
- Location options: Mountain Resort, Beachside Hotel
- Proposed activities: Team-building games, workshops, evening socials.
```

### **2. Process: Analyzing, Reflecting, and Connecting**

**Purpose:**  
The Process step is for engaging critically with the raw input. This is the "why" and "how" of the note—why the input matters and how it connects to broader ideas or decisions. It’s about taking the data or context from the Input and working with it meaningfully.

**What to Put in Process:**
- **Questions to clarify, refine, or explore**:
  - Example: "Does the location meet all logistical requirements?" or "Which tasks are highest priority?"
- **Analysis of patterns, relationships, or meaning**:
  - Example: "Mountain Resort has more outdoor space for team-building activities."
- **Reflections or evaluations**:
  - Example: "Workshops should focus on cross-department collaboration."
- **Connections**:
  - Link this information to related concepts, tasks, or projects.
- **Considerations or challenges**:
  - Example: "Dietary restrictions may complicate meal planning."

**Example (Event Planning):**

```
- Critical Questions:
  - Does the Mountain Resort have enough indoor facilities in case of bad weather?
  - Is the Beachside Hotel too far for easy transportation?
- Observations:
  - Mountain Resort supports outdoor activities but lacks proximity to public transport.
  - Beachside Hotel offers better dining options but limited team-building spaces.
- Challenges:
  - Confirming attendance and dietary needs early will reduce last-minute issues.
```

### **3. Output: Synthesizing into Actions and Insights**

**Purpose:**  
The Output step is where you summarize your conclusions, generate actionable steps, and note insights or takeaways. This is the "what now" of the note—what should you do with this information or analysis?

**What to Put in Output:**
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Summarize the most important insights from the Process step.
  - Example: "Mountain Resort offers better opportunities for team-building activities."
- **Actionable Steps**:
  - Define what needs to be done next, based on the analysis.
  - Example: "Contact the Mountain Resort to confirm availability and pricing."
- **Goals or outcomes**:
  - Specify the desired result of your actions.
  - Example: "Finalize the location by the end of this week."
- **Personal Reflections or Lessons Learned**:
  - Example: "Organizing early reduces logistical stress."
- **Decisions or priorities**:
  - Highlight what has been decided or prioritized.

**Example (Event Planning):**

```
- Key Takeaways:
  - Mountain Resort offers the best facilities for outdoor team-building activities.
  - Transportation logistics may require arranging a shuttle service.
- Actionable Steps:
  - Contact Mountain Resort for pricing and availability (due by October 31).
  - Send out dietary needs survey to all attendees by next week.
- Decisions:
  - Prioritize Mountain Resort but secure a backup option.
- Personal Reflection:
  - Planning early allows room for adjustments; consider starting next year’s retreat planning earlier.
```

### **Generalized Breakdown of Each Step**

Here’s a generalized view of what each step should accomplish, regardless of context:

#### **Input: What You gather**

- Captures all the raw, unprocessed details.
- Answers **“What’s happening?”** or **“What needs to be addressed?”**
- Focuses on facts, observations, or background information.

#### **Process: What You Think about**

- Engages critically with the input.
- Answers **“Why does this matter?”**, **“What patterns or problems exist?”**, or **“How does this connect to broader tasks or ideas?”**
- Focuses on analysis, evaluation, and reflection.

#### **Output: What You do**

- Synthesizes the information into conclusions or next steps.
- Answers **“What’s the plan?”**, **“What are the key takeaways?”**, or **“What actions need to follow?”**
- Focuses on actionable insights, summaries, and future planning.

### **Examples Of Non-Knowledge Use Cases**

#### **Daily Note**

- **Input:** Record daily observations (tasks completed, significant events, mood).
- **Process:** Reflect on the day’s successes, challenges, and areas for improvement.
- **Output:** Define priorities for tomorrow and note lessons learned.

#### **Habit Tracker**

- **Input:** Log habits completed (e.g., exercise, reading, journaling).
- **Process:** Analyze trends or patterns (e.g., "Consistently missed workouts on Mondays").
- **Output:** Adjust the habit plan (e.g., "Move workouts to afternoons on Mondays").

#### **Trading Journal**

- **Input:** Record trades (e.g., stock, price, rationale).
- **Process:** Analyze performance (e.g., "Trade 1 succeeded because of XYZ").
- **Output:** Plan strategy adjustments (e.g., "Focus on sectors showing growth potential").

#### **Meeting Notes**

- **Input:** Document what was discussed, who attended, and key points.
- **Process:** Evaluate decisions made and identify unresolved issues.
- **Output:** Define follow-up tasks and distribute minutes if needed.

### **Final Thoughts**

By generalizing the **Input → Process → Output** structure:
1. **Input** becomes the collection of raw, unfiltered information.
2. **Process** is the thoughtful engagement with that information to draw meaning or insights.
3. **Output** translates everything into actionable steps, decisions, or conclusions.

This framework is versatile enough to apply to virtually any task or situation, whether you're processing knowledge, planning projects, or reflecting on personal activities. Let me know if you’d like help creating specific examples for more use cases!
