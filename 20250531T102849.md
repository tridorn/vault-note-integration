A more surgical formulation would be:  
**"If I pay Germany's exit tax (Wegzugsteuer), return, and later emigrate again, do I incur the tax a second time?"**

### Legal mechanism

1. **Initial departure** -- § 6 AStG taxes latent gains in ≥ 1 % shareholdings (or, from 1 Jan 2025, fund units > €500 k) once you were unlimitedly taxable for 7 of the previous 12 years.

2. **Return within seven years** -- If you re-establish unlimited liability within 7 years (extendable to 12) and have not disposed of the shares, the assessment is cancelled ab initio and any instalments already paid are refunded. ([steuerberaten.de](https://www.steuerberaten.de/blog/579/rueckerstattung-der-wegzugssteuer-bei-rueckkehr-nach-deutschland/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3. **Legal fiction of continuity** -- § 6 (2) s. 4 AStG treats that "temporary absence" as if you had **never left** for the purpose of the 7-/12-year test. This change (Bundestag 2022, JStG draft) expressly blocks the loophole of a quick re-entry/exit cycle. ([Zugtrust](https://www.zugtrust.ch/news/neue-regelungen-zur-wegzugsbesteuerung-analyse-der-entstrickungstatbestaende-seit-2022-54?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Bundestag DServer](https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/047/2004729.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

4. **Second departure** -- A new exit triggers **again** if, counting the years before the first move plus the years after re-entry, you still satisfy "7 in 12" and still hold the qualifying stake. The taxable base, however, is limited to the further appreciation **since the step-up at re-entry**; you are not double-taxed on the same gain.

5. **If the clock no longer fits** -- Only when enough of the earlier residence period has aged out of the 12-year look-back (or your shareholding has fallen below the thresholds) will a second move escape § 6. In practice this demands remaining non-resident for more than a decade or dismantling the holding.

### Strategic consequences

| Leverage point | Practical effect | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Length of stay after return** | A short re-entry does **not** protect you; continuity fiction keeps the 7-year count alive. | 
| **Asset restructuring before return** | Moving shares into a non-German parent, a discretionary trust, or dissolving the ≥ 1 % stake before re-immigration can ring-fence later gains from the second exit tax but must be completed **before** you reacquire German residence. | 
| **Timing** | To avoid a second charge without restructuring, you would need a non-German period > 12 years, which nullifies the earlier residency years. That is rarely compatible with "coming back for a while." | 
| **Cash-flow management** | Installment payment (seven years, with bank guarantee) remains available, but immediate liquidity planning is mandatory; the tax is due at the moment of border-crossing, not at an actual sale. |

### Ancillary traps

- **Extended limited tax liability (§ 2 AStG, ten years)** -- Even after the second exit you may still be taxed on certain German-source income if you are a German national and keep "substantial interests" in Germany. ([Rose & Partner](https://www.rosepartner.de/en/taxes-abroad-emigrants-lawyer-lawfirm-germany.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Inheritance/gift taxes** -- Returning resets the five-year clock that deems German nationals still resident for gift/estate purposes.
- **2025 fund extension** -- From 1 Jan 2025 the regime applies to ETF or fund positions above €500 k or ≥ 1 % of units. Plan restructurings before that threshold bites.

### Executive verdict

You may certainly re-enter Germany, but the legislature has closed the "boomerang" route. A subsequent emigration will re-ignite exit taxation whenever the statutory conditions are met, with the asset basis stepped up to the value on re-entry. Mitigate by either (i) eliminating the qualifying stake before you come back, or (ii) remaining abroad long enough that Germany's 12-year window no longer captures the earlier residence period. Anything short of that is merely postponement, not avoidance.
