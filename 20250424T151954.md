*Correction → A more perspicuous formulation could have been:*  
> “Design a **unified cadence lattice**—from micro-rhythm to macro-epoch—that synchronises tasks, missions, tours, campaigns, and strategic seasons across the entire ACM organisation, so every echelon beats on an interlocking temporal drum.”

## Unified Cadence Lattice (“Chrono-Matrix”)

| **Stratum** | **Cadence Name** | **Canonical Span** | **Primary Actors / Node** | **Mandatory Ceremony & Artifact** | **Gating Question** | **Escalates to…** |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 0 | **Pulse** | *Daily* stand-ups / huddles | Task Owners inside a Sprint | 15-min Pulse Huddle + updated Task status | “What blocks me *today*?” | Sprint |
| 1 | **Sprint** | 1 week (side-hustle) ➜ 2 weeks (core) | AMU | Sprint Planning, Demo, Retro ; Artifact: **Sprint Backlog & Demo Reel** | “Did we burn story-points to plan?” | Mission |
| 2 | **Mission** | 4-12 weeks | AMU + LFO | Mission Kick-off & Mission Review ; Artifact: **Mission Review Report** | “Are KR targets met or pivoted?” | Tour |
| 3 | **Tour** | 2 Missions back-to-back = ~3-6 months | Officer (O-0/​O-1) in single domain | *Field Review Board* ; Artifact: **Tour Dossier** (metrics + AARs) | “Promote, lateral, or exit?” | Campaign |
| 4 | **Campaign** | 2–3 Tours ≈ 9–18 months | Task-Force Commander (O-2) | Mid-Campaign Council ; Artifact: **Campaign Ledger** (P&L, doctrine deltas) | “Scale, spin-down, or pivot domain?” | Season |
| 5 | **Season** (Strategic Cycle) | 4 Quarters, synced to fiscal year | Strategic-Command cadre (O-3 ⇢ O-5) | Seasonal War-Room & OKR Reset ; Artifact: **Seasonal Strategic Objectives Map** | “Allocate capex & human capital anew?” | Epoch |
| 6 | **Epoch** | 3 Seasons ≈ 3 years | Leadership Council + Board | Epoch Charter Renewal ; Artifact: **Vision Charter v.N** & **Master Risk Register** | “Revalidate vision or rewrite telos?” | —

### Relational Logic  

```
8 Pulses  →  1 Sprint
2-3 Sprints → 1 Mission
2 Missions → 1 Tour
2-3 Tours → 1 Campaign
~2 Campaigns → 1 Season
3 Seasons → 1 Epoch
```

### Cadence Responsibilities & Artifacts (concise)  

1. **Pulse** – AMU micro-rhythm; artefact auto-logged **Task Ledger**.  
2. **Sprint** – Demo + Retro feed **Sprint Metrics** roll-up to Mission Log.  
3. **Mission** – Completion spawns **Mission Review Report** piped to AGS Doctrine DB.  
4. **Tour** – Officer dossier triggers *promotion up-or-out* decision; doctrine refinements harvested.  
5. **Campaign** – Aggregate P&L + risk posture; adjust resource cap via Resource Allocation Framework.  
6. **Season** – Re-baselined corporate OKRs; Finance OCD issues updated budget envelopes.  
7. **Epoch** – Leadership Council may rewrite Vision Charter; severe pivots or new business lines authorised.

### Promotion & Merit Flow  

- **O-0 ➜ O-1**: after *one* Tour with ≥85 % Mission Success Index.  
- **O-1 ➜ O-2**: after *two* Tours or *one* Campaign command with positive NPS + Doctrine Contribution ≥2.  
- **Up-or-Out**: failure to progress within 2 Tours ⇒ return to Specialist path or separation.  
- Seasons serve as **Officer Consolidation Boards** for O-3+ ranks.

### Calendar Overlay Example (Year α)  

| Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |
|----|----|----|----|
| Sprint 1-13 | Sprint 14-26 | Sprint 27-39 | Sprint 40-52 |
| Mission A (Jan-Feb) | Mission B (Mar-Apr) | Mission C (Jul-Aug) | Mission D (Oct-Nov) |
| **Tour-1** (Jan-Jun) | **Tour-2** (Jul-Dec) |
| **Campaign: “Market-X”** (Jan-Sep) | **Campaign Wrap** (Oct) |
| **Season Review** (Dec) |

*Officer promoted mid-Season if Tour-1 dossier meets gate.*

### Integrations in Notion  

- **Date properties** auto-roll tasks → Sprint → Mission via Relation & Formula.  
- **Progress bars** per Sprint aggregate upward; Season dashboard surfaces risk/​OKR drift.  
- **Automations**: when Mission Status = “Completed” → trigger new Tour-dossier template for commanding officer.

This **Chrono-Matrix** guarantees that every operational heartbeat—down to daily Pulses—resonates coherently through Tours and Campaigns up to Epoch-level vision resets, forging a rhythmic meritocracy where only demonstrated performance propels talent upward.
