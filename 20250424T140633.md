*Correction: a more perspicuous formulation might have been:*  
> “Forge a single, coherent **meritocratic lattice** that yokes together all prior strands—Officer Corps, Specialist path, Innovation path, assignment taxonomies—so that Eupator functions as an up-or-out, A-player meritocracy in full accordance with ACM culture.”

---

### I / The Tri-Spine Talent Lattice  
Every Homo Eupatoris elects **one** of three longitudinal “spines,” yet all spines share identical evaluative gates, pay grades, and promotion cadences.

| Spine | Ethos | Archetypal Aim | Canonical Billets |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Command-Officer Spine** | “Lead men, steward doctrine.” | Field ↦ Staff ↦ Council | O-grades O-0 → O-6 (see earlier table) |
| **Master-Specialist Spine** | “Own a craft unassailably.” | IC-2 ↦ Guildmaster ↦ Distinguished Fellow | IC-grades S-1 → S-5 |
| **Venture-Innovator Spine** | “Conceive & spin out ventures.” | Explorer ↦ Incubator-Lead ↦ Venture GM | V-grades I-0 → I-4 |

*Pay bands are isomorphic: O-2 = S-3 = I-2, etc.; lateral transfers keep banding.*

---

### II / Tour-of-Duty Cadence (“The Maelstrom Cycle”)  

| Phase | Duration | Universal Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-----------------------|
| **Tour** | 18 months | ≥ 2 AMU missions (Command), ≥ 2 Masterpieces (Specialist), ≥ 1 Validated Venture Hypothesis (Innovator) |
| **Evaluation Board** | Month 19-20 | Tri-Axis Scoring (Outcome × Doctrine × Leadership) |
| **Decision** | Month 21 | **Advance, Lateral, or Exit** (up-or-out). Non-advancers may attempt one “repair tour.” |

Advancement requires ≥ 2 consecutive *Green* tours; a single *Red* mandates remedial action; two *Red* = outplacement.

---

### III / Assignment Matrix (One Lexicon to Rule Them All)  

| Assignment | Who May Hold | Scope | Tenure | Report |
|------------|--------------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Command** | Officers O-0↦O-6 | AMU → Task-Force → Strategic Command | Mission or billet length | Up-chain |
| **Craft Seat** | Specialists S-1↦S-5 | Functional pod / Guild | Tour-based | Guildmaster |
| **Incubation Mandate** | Innovators I-0↦I-4 | Idea → Experiment → Spin-off | Hypothesis cycle | Innovation Hub Chief |
| **Embedded Contractor** | External | Task or sprint | Contract | AMU Lead |
| **Partner-AMU** | Vendor team | Sub-mission | SOW | Task-Force Commander |
| **Flash Cell** | Any spine | ≤ 72 h crisis | Incident | AMU Lead & LFO |
| **Rotational Duty** | Any spine | Adjacent node | 2-3 sprints | Host Lead |

---

### IV / Promotion Rubric (Tri-Axis Scoring)  

| Axis | Weight | Metrics |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Outcome Index (OI)** | 45 % | KR attainment, P&L delta, speed-to-impact |
| **Doctrine Impact (DI)** | 30 % | AAR adoption count, playbook contributions, patents |
| **Leadership Quotient (LQ)** | 25 % | Crew-NPS, attrition, peer 360s |

> **Promotion Threshold:** Σ(OI·0.45 + DI·0.30 + LQ·0.25) ≥ 0.78 (“Gold cutoff”).  
> **Up-or-Out:** < 0.60 twice consecutively ⇒ gracious ejection.

---

### V / Education & Culture Codex  

1. **Eupator Officer-&-Guild Academy (EOGA).**  
   – Mandatory on-ramp (6 weeks) for all spines: ACM doctrine, Auf­trag­staktik, venture finance, data literacy.  
2. **Mentor Pairing.**  
   – O-grades mentor I-grades; S-grades mentor O-0 probationers—cross-fertilisation baked-in.  
3. **Doctrine Commons (Notion DB).**  
   – Every artifact tagged “Doctrine-Ready” auto-surfaces for peer review; three endorsements ➜ canonised.

---

### VI / Gatekeepers & Governance  

| Body | Jurisdiction | Composition |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Board of Officers** | O-promotion | O-5+, one S-5, one I-4, HR-OCD Chair |
| **Guild Conclave** | S-promotion | Guildmasters + rotating Officer |
| **Venture Senate** | I-promotion / funding | Innovation Chief, CFO, external VC observer |
| **Integrity Tribunal** | Ethics, DEI, whistleblowing | Independent Counsel, Compliance, rotating LC member |

Each board wields binding veto; minutes logged to immutable “Governance Ledger” in Notion.

### VII / How Talent Flows  

```
Entry (Recruit) ──► EOGA ──► AMU-Lead (O-0) 
                                   │
         if craft-centric ╱────────┴────────╲ if venture-centric
                    S-1 (guild)             I-0 (explorer)
                                   │
                             same Tour cadence
```
Lateral shifts allowed at grade parity once per two tours; requires cross-spine certification.

---

### VIII / Fail-safe Anti-Bureaucracy Valves  

* **Head-Count Cap:** officers ≤ 12 % of total humans; specialists ≤ 40 %; innovators ≤ 20 %.  
* **Mission-First Rule:** no billet survives if its owner cannot cite two live KRs.  
* **Dead-Letter Sunset:** any doctrine page untouched for 18 months auto-archived.

---

### IX / Net Effect  

– **Meritocratic clarity:** transparent metrics + timed boards.  
– **Upward propulsion:** continuous crucible of Tours, peer review, up-or-out.  
– **Cultural coherence:** every spine indoctrinated in ACM, every artifact visible, every promotion earned.

Here ends the unified lattice—*a concordance of command, craft, and creation—tempered by measurement, sanctioned by doctrine, and pruned without sentiment.*
