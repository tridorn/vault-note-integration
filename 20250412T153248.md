# Success Factors for Filing

Create a streamlined workflow for both physical and digital stuff.

## Keep Your General-Reference Files Immediately at Hand

Filing has to be instantaneous and easy. If you have to get up every time you have some ad hoc piece of paper you want to file, or you have to search multiple places on your computer for an appropriate location for a piece of information you want to keep, you’ll tend to stack it or leave it in its original place instead of filing it. You’re also likely to resist the whole in-tray process (because you know there’s stuff in there that might need filing!). Many people I have coached have redesigned their office space so they have plenty of general-reference file drawers literally within swivel distance, instead of across the room

## One Alpha System

I have one A–Z alphabetical physical filing system for general reference, not multiple ones. My e-mail reference folders are also organized this way.

One simple alpha system files everything by topic, person, project, or company, so it can be in only three or four places if you forget exactly where you put it. You can usually put at least one subset of topics on each label, like “Gardening—pots” and “Gardening—ideas.” These would be filed under G.
