## Dynamic Stretching

Here is a sample dynamic stretching routine you can do before your workouts. Dynamic stretches are generally performed 8-10 times, but this can vary depending on your individual needs and the time you have available.

1. **Leg Swings**: Hold onto a wall or a sturdy object for balance and swing one leg forward and backward. This stretch warms up your hips, thighs, and glutes.

2. **Lateral Leg Swings**: Similar to leg swings but swing your leg side-to-side in front of your body without crossing the midline. This warms up the inner and outer thigh muscles.

3. **Arm Circles**: Extend your arms out to your sides and make small circles forward for 30 seconds, then reverse and do small circles backward for 30 seconds. Increase the size of the circles and repeat. This warms up the shoulders.

4. **Lunges**: Take a step forward with your right foot and lower your body into a lunge position. Push through your right foot to return to a standing position, then repeat on the left side. This warms up your glutes, quads, and hamstrings.

5. **Butt Kicks**: Stand tall and kick one heel up towards your glutes, then repeat with the other heel. You can do this while stationary or walking forward. This warms up your hamstrings and quads.

6. **High Knees**: Stand tall and march in place while lifting your knees as high as possible. This warms up your hips, glutes, and quads.

7. **Torso Twists**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and twist your torso to the right, then to the left. This warms up your core and lower back.

8. **Hip Circles**: Stand with your hands on your hips, feet hip-width apart, and make circles with your hips clockwise, then counter-clockwise. This warms up your hips, lower back, and core.

9. **Neck Rolls**: Stand or sit upright, drop your chin to your chest, then slowly roll your head to the right, back, left, and down in a smooth, circular motion. Switch directions after a few rotations. This warms up your neck muscles.

Remember, the goal of dynamic stretching is to warm up your muscles and joints by moving them through their full range of motion. Be sure to maintain control during the movements - don't fling or throw your body parts around. Each movement should be smooth and deliberate. If any movement causes pain, stop doing it and consult with a healthcare professional or a fitness trainer.

## Static Stretching

Static stretching after a workout can help cool down the body, improve flexibility, and promote recovery. Each stretch should be held for about 20-30 seconds. Here's a sample routine:

1. **Hamstring Stretch**: Sit on the floor with your legs extended straight in front of you. Bend at the waist and reach for your toes, keeping your knees straight.

2. **Quadriceps Stretch**: Stand tall and hold onto a wall or sturdy object for balance. Grab your right foot and pull it towards your buttock, keeping your knees together and pushing your hips forward. Switch and repeat with the left foot.

3. **Calf Stretch**: Stand facing a wall and place your hands on the wall at about chest height. Step back with your right foot, keeping it flat on the ground. Bend your left knee and lean into the wall, feeling the stretch in your right calf. Switch and repeat with the left leg.

4. **Hip Flexor Stretch**: Kneel on your right knee, with your left foot flat on the floor in front of you and your left knee bent at 90 degrees. Push your hips forward until you feel a stretch in the front of your right hip. Switch and repeat with the left hip.

5. **Glute Stretch**: Sit on the floor and extend your legs in front of you. Bend your right knee and place your right foot over your left leg, then twist your torso to the right, pushing against your right knee with your left elbow. Switch and repeat on the left side.

6. **Chest Stretch**: Stand tall, interlace your fingers behind your back, and push your hands down and away from your body, opening up your chest.

7. **Shoulder Stretch**: Extend your right arm across your body and gently pull it towards your chest with your left hand, feeling a stretch in your right shoulder. Switch and repeat with the left arm.

8. **Triceps Stretch**: Raise your right arm overhead, bend at the elbow so your hand is reaching towards your upper back. Use your left hand to gently push down on your right elbow. Switch and repeat with the left arm.

9. **Lower Back Stretch**: Lie on your back, hug your knees to your chest, and gently rock side to side.

10. **Neck Stretch**: Sit or stand tall, gently tilt your head to the right, bringing your ear towards your shoulder until you feel a stretch in the left side of your neck. Switch and repeat on the left side.

As always, make sure to breathe deeply and relax during each stretch, and never stretch to the point of pain. If any stretch causes discomfort, back off or skip that stretch.
