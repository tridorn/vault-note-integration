### Tips for Maintaining the Folder Structure

1. **Set Up Rules and Filters**: Configure your email client to automatically move emails to the appropriate folders based on the alias they were sent to or keywords in the subject.
2. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your folders to clean up or archive old emails, ensuring your folders remain organized and manageable.
3. **Use Labels/Tags**: If your email client supports it, use labels or tags in addition to folders for more granular organization.

This structured approach will help you keep your emails organized, making it easier to manage your inbox and find important communications when needed.
