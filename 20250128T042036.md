You’re absolutely right to focus on tasks that align with a **project's current stage**. This approach keeps your system focused and avoids unnecessary clutter. Here’s a guide to help you decide **how to handle tasks for each stage**, **what to do with sequential tasks**, and **how to integrate milestones** effectively.

---

## **1. Tasks and Current Project Stage**

Only create tasks relevant to the **current stage** of a project. This ensures you're working on actionable steps without getting bogged down by tasks that depend on future work.

### **How To Handle Each Stage**

#### **a. Planning Stage**

- **Focus**: Structuring the project, identifying resources, and defining the scope.
- **Create Tasks for**:
  - Key deliverables or outcomes (e.g., "Outline project phases").
  - High-level milestones (e.g., "Define timeline for execution").
  - Dependencies to resolve before moving to execution (e.g., "Gather team inputs").
- **Avoid**:
  - Overly granular actions unless they are critical for planning.

**Example**:
- **Project**: Write a Book
  - "Break down chapters into sections."
  - "Define schedule for writing."
  - "Research reference materials."

---

#### **b. Execution Stage**

- **Focus**: Completing actionable work.
- **Create Tasks for**:
  - Immediate, actionable next steps (e.g., "Draft Chapter 1").
  - Any preparatory tasks required for subsequent work (e.g., "Gather quotes for Chapter 1").
- **Avoid**:
  - Creating all sequential tasks at once (e.g., "Write Chapter 1, 2, 3, etc."). Instead, focus on the **current or next immediate step**.

**Example**:
- **Project**: Write a Book
  - "Write outline for Chapter 1."
  - "Draft Chapter 1."
  - (Once Chapter 1 is complete: "Draft Chapter 2.")

---

#### **c. Review Stage**

- **Focus**: Evaluating the work done, refining outputs, and preparing for delivery.
- **Create Tasks for**:
  - Quality checks (e.g., "Review Chapter 1 for consistency").
  - Stakeholder feedback (e.g., "Send draft to editor").
  - Addressing flagged issues (e.g., "Rewrite unclear sections").
- **Avoid**:
  - Creating tasks unrelated to the current state of the project (e.g., future updates or maintenance).

**Example**:
- **Project**: Write a Book
  - "Review Chapter 1 for flow."
  - "Incorporate editor's feedback."

---

#### **d. Milestone Delivery**

- **Focus**: Completing significant phases or delivering outcomes.
- **Create Tasks for**:
  - Formal submission steps (e.g., "Submit final manuscript to publisher").
  - Delivering presentations or progress updates (e.g., "Present draft to stakeholders").
  - Wrapping up deliverables (e.g., "Compile references for appendices").

**Example**:
- **Project**: Write a Book
  - "Submit manuscript to publisher."
  - "Send thank-you notes to contributors."

---

#### **e. Maintenance and Closure**

- **Focus**: Finalizing the project, archiving materials, or managing ongoing updates.
- **Create Tasks for**:
  - Maintenance items (e.g., "Update book website with new links").
  - Archival steps (e.g., "Archive research notes").
  - Closing reflections (e.g., "Document lessons learned").

**Example**:
- **Project**: Write a Book
  - "Archive manuscript versions."
  - "Write project retrospective."

---

### **2. How to Handle Sequential Tasks**

For sequential tasks (e.g., "Read Chapter 1 before Chapter 2"), only create the **next actionable step** in your task manager. 

#### **Why Not Create All Sequential Tasks at Once?**

1. **Avoid Cognitive Overload**:
	- Listing all tasks can clutter your system and distract you from what’s actionable now.
2. **Adaptability**:
	- Plans often change during execution. Listing future tasks might create unnecessary adjustments later.

#### **How To Manage Sequential Tasks**

- Use **notes or checklists** within the project card for future steps.
- As each task is completed, move the next sequential step into your active task list.

**Example**:
- **Project**: Read a Book
  - Current Task: "Read Chapter 1."
  - Project Notes:
	 - Next Steps: 
		- "Read Chapter 2."
		- "Summarize key points from Chapter 2."

---

### **3. Milestones**

Milestones help break projects into manageable chunks and provide checkpoints for progress. They are **not tasks themselves** but are supported by associated tasks.

#### **Why Milestones Matter**

- **Clarity**: Milestones give you a clear sense of progress and achievement.
- **Motivation**: Reaching milestones boosts momentum.
- **Structure**: Milestones create logical breakpoints in larger projects.

#### **How To Integrate Milestones**

1. **Define Milestones in the Planning Stage**:
	- Identify key deliverables or outcomes (e.g., "Complete first draft").
2. **Link Tasks to Milestones**:
	- Ensure tasks align with achieving the milestone.
3. **Track Milestones in Your Kanban System**:
	- Add milestones as labels or separate cards in your project stages.

#### **Example Of Milestones and Tasks**

- **Project**: Write a Book
  - **Milestone 1**: Complete Outline
	 - Tasks:
		- "Brainstorm chapter topics."
		- "Finalize chapter structure."
  - **Milestone 2**: Draft First Half
	 - Tasks:
		- "Write draft for Chapter 1."
		- "Write draft for Chapter 2."
  - **Milestone 3**: Submit Final Manuscript
	 - Tasks:
		- "Incorporate editor's feedback."
		- "Finalize references."

### **4. Practical Workflow**

#### **Task Creation**

1. **Identify the Project Stage**:
	- Only create tasks relevant to the current stage.
2. **Break Down the Next Steps**:
	- Focus on actionable, immediate tasks.
	- Use project notes for deferred or sequential tasks.

#### **Daily Workflow**

1. Use **Overviews** (`Today`, `High Priority`, etc.) to focus on immediate actions.
2. Review **Active Projects** in the Kanban system to ensure tasks align with current project stages.
3. Move tasks into the **next stage** as they are completed.

#### **Weekly Workflow**

1. Review all **projects**:
	- Ensure each has at least one actionable task if it’s in an active stage.
	- Move stalled projects into planning or ideation as needed.
2. Update milestones:
	- Mark completed milestones and adjust future ones as necessary.

---

### **Summary**

1. **Only Create Tasks for the Current Stage**:
	- Focus on what’s actionable now. Avoid cluttering your system with future steps.
2. **Use Notes for Sequential Tasks**:
	- Keep future steps or ideas in project notes or checklists.
3. **Leverage Milestones**:
	- Use milestones to track progress and align tasks with key deliverables.

This approach keeps your system lean, actionable, and focused on progress. Let me know if you need further refinements!
