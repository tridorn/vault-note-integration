**Context**: I operate as a consulting analyst with executional responsibilities in slide and model creation. I rely on structured problem-solving frameworks to clarify ambiguity, construct logic, and deliver high-grade outputs fast. Use the following frameworks as my operating system.

---

### 🔧 **OSDC — Problem-Solving Operating System**

> A tactical cognitive loop for solving ambiguous problems under pressure.

* **Orient**: Clarify the real problem. Restate the objective.
* **Structure**: Decompose into MECE drivers. Build issue/hypothesis trees.
* **Drive**: Prove or disprove hypotheses. Research and model with precision.
* **Communicate**: Synthesize into slides, models, or written arguments. Title = conclusion.

**Use for**: Any discrete analytical task—deck, model, research brief, logic check.

---

### 🧱 **CLEAR — Full Project Execution Framework**

> A structured lifecycle model for end-to-end consulting delivery.

* **Clarify**: Define problem, structure logic tree, list hypotheses.
* **Leverage**: Collect only evidence needed to test those hypotheses.
* **Evaluate**: Build models, interpret results, extract implications.
* **Advise**: Formulate recommendations, tradeoffs, and a roadmap.
* **Relay**: Construct persuasive slides and defend logic in client conversation.

**Use for**: Framing and delivering whole workstreams, not just tasks.

---

### 🧠 **RAPT — Hypothesis-Driven Research Model**

> A methodology for targeted research and analysis.

* **Reframe**: Turn the task into a testable hypothesis.
* **Assemble**: List assumptions and sub-claims.
* **Pull**: Search only for what validates/refutes the hypothesis.
* **Transform**: Every 2–3 facts → 1 conclusion → slide or model input.

**Use for**: Research prompts, benchmarking, pre-slide analysis.

---

### 🗂️ **Slide Doctrine — Communication Discipline**

> Each slide must prove *one* argument with clear logic.

* **Title = Conclusion**
* **Chart = Visual Proof**
* **Body = Implication or next question**

**Use for**: Deck creation, executive presentations, internal memos.

---

### 🧭 **Workflow Cascade**

> Every deliverable should trace back like this:

```
Problem Statement
→ Key Question
→ Issue Tree (MECE Drivers)
→ Hypotheses per Branch
→ Evidence per Hypothesis
→ Findings → Synthesis Points
→ Recommendation Options
→ Final Direction + Roadmap
→ Slides
```

**Use for**: Building logically coherent arguments from scratch.

---

### 🧰 **How to Use This Primer**

At the beginning of any session:

* Assume I want outputs framed in OSDC logic.
* If the task is broader, assume we are in a phase of CLEAR.
* If I ask for research or analysis, apply RAPT.
* Deliver outputs as structured slide-level insights, unless otherwise specified.

These are supposed to structure my thinking, so that I'm able to do things on my own. However, I have to deliver output right this instant and I don't feel ready for it. I am tasked to prepare the kick-off for our consulting project but currently have literally nothing. Attached are an agenda for the kick-off, an example of how a kick-off pitch looked before (with the DOSB), a presentation I started for my analysis results (might be part of the kick-off, but not core), and an introduction to the project (with Zehnder). I'm also tasked to create a spreadsheet with hypotheses so we can test the waters with them, how they feel about certain topics (as they have more knowledge of the topic, allows us to narrow our search).

The below is one approach to some of the base questions.

Ben -- here's the direct route forward. You're under acute pressure, but we can weaponize structure over stress. Your task is to deliver a **Zehnder Strategy Kick-Off**, with three interlinked outputs:  
  
1. **A high-grade kick-off deck** (think structure + direction, not data overload)  
  
2. **A testable hypotheses Excel to probe Zehnder's stance**  
  
3. **A tactical narrative to frame Phase I execution and secure alignment**  
  
  
You're in Phase **C** of **CLEAR**: _Clarify_. What follows is a battle-ready Kickoff Blueprint grounded in your material and primed for execution.  
  
---  
  
## 🔧 OSDC APPLICATION -- STRATEGIC KICK-OFF PREPARATION  
  
### **O -- Orient: Restate the Objective**  
  
**Zehnder Objective:**    
Design and implement a strategy for radiator market growth across EU5, navigating regulatory disruption, shifting customer demands, and emerging tech -- without delusion or waste.  
  
**Kick-Off Objective:**    
Secure Zehnder leadership's alignment on:  
  
- The strategic problem definition ("Where to play / how to win")  
  
- Our hypothesis-led project roadmap (CLEAR)  
  
- What we need from Zehnder (data, interviews, judgment calls)  
  
  
---  
  
### **S -- Structure: Break Down the Problem**  
  
Using your **workflow cascade**, here's how the project scaffolds:  
  
#### Problem Statement  
  
How can Zehnder reclaim growth in a saturated and regulated European radiator market?  
  
#### Key Questions  
  
- What are the most attractive market/product/channel segments?  
  
- How do we outperform entrenched and agile competitors?  
  
- Where does Zehnder's operating model block growth?  
  
  
#### Issue Tree (Condensed)  
  
**1. Where to Play**  
  
- Markets (country-by-country potential)  
  
- Products (panel, towel, electric, hybrid, smart)  
  
- Channels (traditional, eCom, wholesale, direct)  
  
  
**2. How to Win**  
  
- Capability gaps (R&D, sales, ops, digital)  
  
- GTM strategy misalignments  
  
- Pricing/Positioning inconsistencies

### **D -- Drive: Hypotheses to Test with Zehnder**  
  
You need a **hypotheses spreadsheet** with a clear logic:  
  
#### Format (Excel Structure -- by Cluster)  
  
|**Cluster**|**Hypothesis**|**Confidence (1-5)**|**Implication if True**|**Comment**|  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
|Regulatorik|BEG subsidies are driving disproportionate growth in low-temp radiator demand|3|Prioritize Type 33 portfolio in DE|Link to EPBD and heat-pump push|  
|Kunden|B2B installers value ease-of-installation > design in >70% of cases|4|Redesign install process + messaging|Validate via VoC interviews|  
|Produkt|Dual-fuel towel radiators are underrepresented in DE and FR|2|Portfolio gap → product dev needed|Add sales data to validate|  
|Vertriebskanal|Online DIY channels are negligible in IT and CH|4|Focus on trade/wholesale build-up|Confirm with local team|  
|Wettbewerb|IRSAP dominates showroom presence in IT and FR|5|Channel strategy + design innovation|Build DD competitor slides|  
|Pricing|Zehnder premium is not matched by brand awareness in electric segment|3|Brand push + pricing logic refinement|Cross-check with consumer data|  
|Zehnder|Existing salesforce too anchored in hydronic-only value narrative|2|GTM refresh + electric/HP positioning|Interview sales leads directly|  
  
> **Action**: I can draft this Excel for you immediately if desired. Just confirm.

### **C -- Communicate: Kick-Off Deck Architecture**  
  
Use the DOSB Kick-Off deck structure as form, Zehnder content as substance. Your deck should _not_ sell conclusions. It must establish **clarity, direction, and collaboration expectations**.  
  
---  
  
## 📊 SLIDE STRUCTURE -- ZEHNDER KICK-OFF DECK (PROPOSAL)  
  
**Slide 1** -- **Title Slide**    
"Zehnder Growth Strategy -- Kick-Off"  
  
**Slide 2** -- **Objective & Success Criteria**    
Clarify Phase I: define "Where to Play" + "How to Win"  
  
**Slide 3** -- **Project Plan & Phases**    
Show milestone logic (MS00--MS06), highlight Phase I deliverables  
  
**Slide 4** -- **Stakeholder Engagement Model**    
Define review cadence, interviews, and decision gates  
  
**Slide 5** -- **Strategic Frame: Core Questions**    
Pose your 3 big questions (Market Focus, Operating Model Fit, Competitive Differentiation)  
  
**Slide 6** -- **Market Context Snapshot (teaser)**    
5 bullets: demand drop, heat pump policy, electrification, VoC importance, white space risk  
  
**Slide 7** -- **Initial Hypotheses (teaser)**    
Present 5-7 strong hypotheses from your Excel, invite reaction  
  
**Slide 8** -- **Information Required from Zehnder**    
What you _must_ have in coming 10 days (data, contacts, internal views)  
  
**Slide 9** -- **Next Steps**    
Align on workshop dates, MS01/02 input, hypothesis workshop timing  
  
---  
  
## 🎯 Immediate Tactical Priorities  
  
1. **Build the Hypothesis Excel**    
→ Format as above, 3 per cluster. Ready to test waters.  
  
2. **Draft the Kick-Off Deck**    
→ Skeleton deck ready in 3 hours if desired. Add content on request.  
  
3. **Define Open Questions List for Zehnder**    
→ Frame as "What do we need you to react to or clarify to move forward?"  
  
4. **Prepare Deep-Dive Template for Competitors**    
→ One-pager per: Stelrad, Purmo, Glen Dimplex, IRSAP, Jaga. Standard format = product range, GTM, pricing, positioning, innovations.

Would you like me to **generate the Excel file and the Kick-Off deck skeleton immediately**?  
  
If yes, I'll do both in parallel -- you'll have execution-ready materials to plug and run. Just confirm.
