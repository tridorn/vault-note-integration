### Playbook -- Scoping the Execution Stack

_Use this when deciding whether to spawn a new Cell, Mission, Project, Program, or Campaign._  
All questions below should be answered **before** you create artefacts or invite contributors.
* * *

## 1 Cell ðŸŸ¢

**When to spawn one**

1. Work chunk fits inside the current Sprint (â‰¤ 10 working days).

2. Requires â‰¤ 5 focused people sharing the same discipline or code-base.

3. No contractual dependency outside the parent Mission.

4. Success metric is binary ("done / not done"), not KPI-based.

**Red flags**

- KPI impact can't be traced to parent Mission â†’ you're masking a Mission.
- You need a FO or budget approval â†’ scope one level up.
* * *

## 2 Mission ðŸŸ¡

**Gate questions (all must be "yes")**

1. **Objective clarity:** can you finish the sentence _"When Mission X ends, Y will exist"_ in < 20 words?

2. **Timebox certainty:** is 6-12 weeks enough to reach that objective with high probability?

3. **Autonomy boundary:** can the team deliver without waiting on external prioritisation decisions?

4. **Cross-functionality:** does it need â‰¥ 2 disciplines (e.g., design + frontend) to succeed?

5. **Owner available:** is a Commander ready and not overloaded (> 2 concurrent Missions)?

**Scope sizing heuristics**

- **Too small** â†’ objective achievable in < 3 weeks â†’ stay a Cell.
- **Too large** â†’ cannot list top 5 risks on one page â†’ split into sibling Missions.
* * *

## 3 Project ðŸŸ 

**Create one only if**

1. Multiple Missions aim at a _single externally recognisable artefact_ (product, client deliverable, compliance package).

2. Deliverable spans â‰¥ 12 weeks in calendar time.

3. Budget, legal exposure, or client promise needs _one ledger_ for accountability.

4. Closing the Project would not automatically terminate its Missions (i.e., Missions can continue elsewhere).

**Sizing rule-of-thumb**

- 2--6 concurrent Missions = healthy Project.
- > 8 Missions = fracture into two Projects or elevate into a Program.
* * *

## 4 Program ðŸ”µ

**Spawn when**

1. You have _at least two Projects_ that share a macro KPI (e.g., churn â†“, market-share â†‘).

2. Resource trade-offs are happening between those Projects every quarter.

3. One leader can articulate an integrated roadmap covering â‰¥ 6 months.

4. Ending the Program means Projects would lose their shared KPI context.

**Common scoping errors**

- Using Program to park unrelated Projects just to simplify reporting â†’ creates bureaucratic fog.
- Treating large Project as Program substitute â†’ impedes cross-project risk balancing.
* * *

## 5 Campaign ðŸ”´

**Minimum entry criteria**

1. **Strategic bet:** outcome materially shifts the company's market position or long-range cost base.

2. **Capital envelope:** > 10 % of annual budget or > 6 FTE for â‰¥ 12 months.

3. **Multiple Programs** required; single Program isn't sufficient.

4. **Council sponsorship** secured; decision to start or stop sits at Strategic Council level.

**Sizing guardrails**

- If the ambition fits on less than one page of strategic outcomes, it's likely still a Program.
- If kill-cost is < 3 months burn, it's not a Campaign.

## Quick-Reference Matrix -- When to Split, When to Merge

| Symptom (in current unit) | Action | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Objective drifts > 15 % every Sprint | Split into smaller Missions | 
| Weekly blockers come from more than two external owners | Elevate to Project | 
| Budget discussions involve â‰¥ 3 Projects | Elevate to Program | 
| Two Programs fighting for the same capital pool and KPI | Merge under one Campaign | 
| Commander manages > 7 parallel Cells | Spawn a second Cell or new Mission | 

* * *

## Decision Checklist (print-size)

> **Before spawning any unit, answer:**
> 
> 1. _What problem dies when this unit succeeds?_
> 
> 2. _What must exist that doesn't today?_
> 
> 3. _What is the single measurable signal of "done"?_
> 
> 4. _Who loses resources if this unit is created?_
> 
> 5. _Who owns the post-mortem if it fails?_

If answers occupy more than one typed page, you're scoping too big.  
If any answer is blank, you're scoping too small or inventing a unit you don't need.

### Principle to remember

> **Units exist to **absorb coordination cost**.  
Spawn the smallest unit that cancels meaningful uncertainty, and no smaller.
