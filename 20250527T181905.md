**Refinement of your request:**
More precisely, you’re asking: *“Evaluate and redesign the current slide structure used for customer segment VoC synthesis, optimising for clarity and strategic value. Then, provide a prebuilt ChatGPT ADA prompt that auto-generates output in this improved structure.”*

---

## I. **Assessment of Your Current Slide Structure**

### Structure:

Per **customer segment** (slide):

1. Top 3 VoC themes
2. Regional theme differences (North, East, South, West, Central)
3. Primary frustration
4. Consequence
5. Action point

### Evaluation:

| Element                        | Utility                                   | Limitation                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Top 3 Themes**               | Solid – distills complexity               | Lacks prioritisation by impact or urgency                   |
| **Regional Differences Table** | Valuable – captures geographic divergence | Can easily become noise if themes don’t meaningfully differ |
| **Primary Frustration**        | High-signal                               | Too narrow: a single frustration may oversimplify           |
| **Consequence**                | Useful for impact                         | Often vague or hard to quantify in natural language         |
| **Action Point**               | Strategic                                 | Risk of generic/unsubstantiated recommendations             |

### Key Omissions:

* No **theme intensity/frequency** indicators
* No **latent needs** or **emotional tone** synthesis
* No indication of **sentiment polarisation**
* No **temporal shifts** if interviews span a time range

---

## II. **Optimised Slide Structure (Per Segment)**

### New Structure:

**1. Executive Summary (One-liner)**
→ A precise summary of what this segment cares about and why it matters

**2. Top 3 VoC Themes**

* Label
* Summary (1 sentence)
* % of mentions
* Emotional tone (positive / negative / mixed)

**3. Regional Divergence Table**

| Region | Unique Themes | Intensity Change (+/−) | Distinct Frustration |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |

**4. Primary Pain Points (x2–3)**

* Description
* Underlying Cause (if inferable)
* Representative Quote

**5. Strategic Implications**

* If ignored...
* If addressed...

**6. Recommended Actions**

* Concrete, high-leverage, segment-specific

## III. **Prebuilt Prompt for ChatGPT with ADA**

Paste this after uploading your Excel file:

---

> **Prompt:**
>
> I have uploaded an Excel file containing qualitative customer interview data. Each row includes a response from a customer, along with metadata: `segment`, `region`, and `response`.
>
> I want you to synthesise this dataset **per customer segment** using the following output format for each segment:
>
> ### 1. Executive Summary (1 sentence)
>
> A precise summary of what this customer segment primarily cares about, in business-relevant terms.
>
> ### 2. Top 3 VoC Themes
>
> For each theme:
>
> * Theme label
> * One-sentence summary
> * Approximate % of customers who mention it in this segment
> * General emotional tone (positive / negative / mixed)
>
> ### 3. Regional Divergence Table
>
> | Region | Unique Themes (if any) | Intensity Change (vs segment average) | Distinct Frustration |
> | ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
>
> ### 4. Primary Pain Points (2–3 max)
>
> For each:
>
> * Description
> * Inferred root cause
> * Supporting quote
>
> ### 5. Strategic Implications
>
> * What is at stake if these needs are ignored?
> * What leverage could be gained by solving them?
>
> ### 6. Recommended Actions
>
> Prioritise 1–2 specific, segment-relevant actions based on the above. Be precise and grounded in the data.
>
> Additional constraints:
>
> * Use only the 'response' column for qualitative input
> * Use the 'segment' and 'region' columns for segmentation
> * If any segment lacks enough responses, note “insufficient data”
>
> Output each segment as a separate section. Limit total output length to what fits in a slide per segment (≈250–300 words max).

**Optional Continuations:**

* To zoom into a specific segment:

  > *“Repeat the above, but only for the segment 'Enterprise Tech Users'. Go deeper: list sub-themes for Theme 1.”*

* To create visuals:

  > *“Generate a bar chart showing the frequency of top 5 themes across all regions for the segment 'SMB East'.”*
