### Guiding Maxim  
**In an empirical MVP, pursue *evidence of value* —not ontological completeness.**  
The facet catalogue is your long-run specification; the MVP exploits only the minimum subset needed to falsify the core business hypotheses.

## 1 Which Layers Must Be Honoured *Now*?

| Layer | Why It Matters in MVP | MVP Fidelity Rule |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Macro Flow** *(Onboard → Evaluate → Disburse → Report)* | Lets every actor experience the *end-to-end* promise—speed, clarity, incentive capture. | **Follow strictly**. No skipped phases. |
| **Facet Model** | Gives a single container to anchor evidence; prevents document scatter even in spreadsheets. | **Follow lightly**—instantiate only the facets that prove or disprove hypotheses. |
| **State Discipline** | Prevents ambiguity when humans emulate the platform. | **Follow minimally**—binary states (“Open/Closed”, “Verified/Rejected”) are enough. |
| **Event Codes (O-ledger)** | Generates an audit trail to de-risk regulatory conversation. | **Log events**, but don’t obsess over perfect taxonomy. |

## 2 Minimal Facet Set for a Concierge MVP  

| UID | Facet | Why It Can’t Be Dropped in MVP |
|-----|-------|--------------------------------|
| F-00 | **CoreHeader** | Root identity & actor linkage—one row in your sheet. |
| F-03 | **FinancialFacet** | Hypothesis #1 & #3 target credit economics. |
| F-12 | **ImpactFacet** | Green benefit is your unique selling axis. |
| F-16 | **VendorFacet** | Needed to show vendor friction reduction. |
| F-17 | **VerificationFacet** | Confirms audit-time feasibility (hypothesis #4). |
| F-23 | **CreditDecisionFacet** | Underwriter speed metric hinges on this. |
| F-07 | **DisbursementFacet** | Tangible “money-moved” proof. |

*Everything else (fees, FX, covenant monitoring, insurance, tokenisation …) is intellectually elegant but non-essential to MVP learning.*

---

## 3 Operating Tactic—“Facet Stubs”  

* Treat non-critical facets as **place-holders**: create a column in the ledger, mark “N/A (MVP)”.  
* If a stakeholder suddenly demands data that belongs to a dormant facet (e.g., collateral files → F-08), **promote** that facet into the active set—add rows and simplest states.

## 4 Flow Discipline vs Facet Granularity  

| Decision Point | Follow Macro Flow? | Follow Full Facet Detail? |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| SME onboarding | **Yes** | No—just CoreHeader and KYC files. |
| Vendor proposal | **Yes** | VendorFacet only needs `ProposalHash` and `Status`. |
| Verification cycle | **Yes** | VerificationFacet can be “Planned/Verified”; skip sub-states. |
| Credit decision | **Yes** | CreditDecisionFacet can be “Approved/Declined”; omit risk-grade schema. |
| Impact reporting | **Optional** if within 30-day pilot | If captured, log CO₂-delta in ImpactFacet; no full methodology schema. |

---

## 5 Practical Checklist

1. **Spreadsheet Template** – Sheet#1: CoreHeader + seven facets above. Sheet#2: O-event log.  
2. **Pilot SOP** – Script exactly when a cell moves from *Draft* to *Verified* (e.g., verifier e-mail arrives).  
3. **Stopwatch Metrics** – For every macro phase record start/finish timestamps; ignore intra-facet micro-timing for now.  
4. **Retrospective** – After three opportunities, ask each actor: *“Which data point felt superfluous?”* – prune or postpone that facet.

---

### One-Sentence Rule  
> **Drive the full macro flow with the leanest facet subset that still exposes each stakeholder’s incentive delta; everything else waits for post-MVP automation.**

Adhere to that, and the MVP stays tractable, evidence-rich, and free from premature ontology worship.
