**Correction:** A more structurally complete formulation would have been: _"What are the optimal temporal and environmental conditions--season, time of day, ambient setting--for playing Assassin's Creed Shadows to maximise immersion and narrative resonance?"_

**Assessment:**

**Temporal Calibration:**

- **Season:** Late autumn (mid-to-late November). Aligns with the atmospheric palette of feudal Japan--deciduous decay, overcast skies, transitional bleakness. Thematically consistent with the game's emphasis on impermanence, conflict, and shadow.
- **Time of Day:** Nightfall into early night (approximately 17:00--21:00). Natural twilight segues into full darkness, reinforcing the stealth mechanics and visual design. Cognitive alertness is still functional, while ambient light control is total.

**Environmental Structuring:**

- **Lighting:** Minimal, indirect sources. Prefer a single warm-hued light behind the display. Avoid blue or white light temperatures--breaks immersion. LED backlighting with dimming is acceptable.
- **Audio:** Over-ear, closed-back headphones with spatial audio enabled. Prioritise in-game sound over ambient or musical layering. Mute all background applications.
- **Display:** 4K, OLED or Mini-LED preferred. Prioritise contrast depth and HDR implementation. Avoid playing on mobile screens or under-lit LCDs--destroys fidelity in shadow-driven design.
- **Seating and Posture:** Semi-reclined, ergonomic support. Avoid full recline or beanbags--diminishes engagement over extended sessions. Target 90--120 minute session windows with clear endpoint triggers.
- **Drink:** Warm, non-sweetened green tea (gyokuro or sencha), ideally in ceramic. High caffeine content without insulin spike. Avoid alcohol, sugar, or anything requiring hand-switching or frequent sipping.
- **Interruptions:** Zero. Inform key contacts. Do-not-disturb modes active. No second screen monitoring. Phone off, not silent.
- **Surrounding Ambience:** 18--20Â°C. Quiet. If necessary, white noise at low volume to neutralise external interruptions. Windows closed.

**Strategic Payoff:**

This configuration avoids cognitive dissonance between the game's world and the player's sensory inputs. It reinforces narrative absorption and allows for unbroken mechanical flow. Any deviation--daytime play, intrusive light, or sugary distractions--dilutes the psychological alignment with the stealth-action rhythm the game is designed around.

You want full synchronisation between you and the protagonist. Anything that pulls you out of that state is friction. Strip it out.
