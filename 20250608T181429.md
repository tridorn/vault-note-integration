A more rigorous phrasing would be: _"Outline the concrete pathway from my solitary German UG to the Vienna-centric, Swiss-anchored architecture just defined."_

* * *

## Transition Doctrine

### Phase 0 -- Internal Fortification (Months 0-12, € 0-50 k turnover)

1. **Clean-room the UG**  
• Finalise founder IP assignment, employee IP clauses, and mission-book discipline.  
• Adopt IFRS-compatible bookkeeping from day one--future cross-border mergers require it.

2. **Asset map**  
• Catalogue proprietary code, brand marks, process docs--the items to be upstreamed later.

### Phase 1 -- Cross-Border Interface (Turnover ≥ € 50 k or first substantial client)

1. **Incorporate _Eupator GmbH_ (Austria)**  
• € 35 k share capital; pay in the statutory € 17.5 k minimum, stagger the rest.  
• Register a Vienna coworking desk; no full migration yet.

2. **Share swap**  
• German UG subscribes for 100 % of Austrian GmbH shares via cash or non-cash contribution (IP bundle).  
• UG now becomes an _operating subsidiary_ of its own Austrian parent--reverse of final state, but legally trivial and capital-light.  
• Rationale: allows Austrian entity to season its books, open bank lines, and hire Viennese staff while you still reside in Germany.

### Phase 2 -- Sovereign Layer Ignition (Assets ≈ € 200 k; repeat revenue; first external investors)

1. **Establish _House Eupator Stiftung_ (Zug / Schwyz)**  
• Irrevocable purpose: stewardship of doctrine, capital allocation, IP veto rights.  
• Board: you + one trusted fiduciary; voting rules hard-coded.

2. **Create _Eupator Holding GmbH_ (Vienna)**  
• Stiftung injects CHF capital, becomes 100 % owner.  
• Austrian Holding now owns:  
-- Austrian _Eupator GmbH_ (ops)  
-- German UG (legacy)  
-- UK Ltd (optics)  
• All intellectual property, brand, and cap-table authority sits one step below the Stiftung--clean lines.

### Phase 3 -- Operational Flip (Headcount 50-200, Year-end run-rate ≥ € 2 m)

1. **Cross-border merger: UG ⇒ Austrian GmbH**  
• EU Directive 2019/2121 enables a straightforward legal merger; the German unit is absorbed, employees transferred under TUPE-equivalent protection.  
• Result: one corporate payroll hub--Vienna.

2. **Facility commitment**  
• Lease long-term campus in a Viennese Industrieviertel district (cheaper, logistically rich).  
• Core functions (product, design, HR, lore lab) relocate; German presence becomes a satellite R&D cell or is wound down.

### Phase 4 -- Scale Mesh (Headcount 200-1 000)

1. **Talent satellites**  
• Tallinn Dev Hub OÜ, Barcelona Creatives SL, Warsaw Data Ops Sp.z o.o.--each wholly owned by Austrian holding.

2. **London Ltd repurposed**  
• Converts to UK branch of Austrian holding; hosts IR, treasury, and road-show suites only.

3. **Governance cadence**  
• Quarterly strategy conclave in Zug; monthly ops council in Vienna.  
• Doctrine amendments require Stiftung super-majority; operating pivots require holding-board simple majority.

## Trade-Off Ledger

| Decision | Leverage | Hidden Cost | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Early Austrian GmbH** | Seasoned accounts, local grants, EU hiring ease | € 35 k locked share capital | 
| **Swiss Stiftung** | Impenetrable control, asset firewall | Irrevocable--cannot be "undone" | 
| **Cross-border merger** | Single payroll & compliance regime | One-off legal + notary fees (~€ 25-30 k) | 
| **Vienna HQ campus** | Symbol + talent magnet | Higher social contributions than EE satellites |

## Command Directives

1. **Do not dissolve the UG prematurely**--use it as the legal vessel for German revenue until Austrian ops can assume invoicing without friction.

2. **Accumulate merger documentation now**--audited opening balance, IP valuations, employment contracts; this shortens Phase 3 lead-time.

3. **Engage Austrian Förderbank (aws)** in Phase 1--subsidised innovation loans require early filings.

4. **Board choreography**: place a Swiss resident on the Stiftung board to avoid de-facto management accusations.

5. **Maintain UK Ltd minimal**--one director, dormant filing option until Series A optics force re-activation.

Execute this pathway and the Vienna HQ becomes the operative nexus without compromising the sovereignty firewall in Switzerland or the external gravitas of London.
