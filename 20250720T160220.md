Below is a **clean-slate, first-principles YAML front-matter schema**. It keeps the footprint _small and consistent_ while still capturing everything you need for identity, lifecycle, and discovery.  
I've grouped the keys into logical blocks so you--and future automation--can reason about them unambiguously.
    
    
    # ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # 1.⁠⁠⁠ Identity -- "What note is this?"
    # ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    uid: 20250720115742                # ULID / sortable UUID; doubles as default filename
    title: Deep Work Retrospective     # H1 is mirrored here; linter enforces sync
    aliases:
      - 2025-07 Deep Work Retro
      - DW Retro                        
    
    owner: hk                           # initials or @handle; array if shared
    created: 2025-07-20T09:57:42+02:00  # ISO-8601 with timezone
    updated: 2025-07-20T11:04:18+02:00  # auto-overwritten by linter/git-hook
    
    # ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # 2.⁠⁠⁠ Lifecycle -- "Where is it on the conveyor belt?"
    # ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    stage: work                         # {capture|triage|nurture|plan|work|deliver|learn|library}
    status: draft                       # {idea|draft|review|final}; orthogonal to stage
    project: P2025-003 Deep_Work_Book   # links to a folder or ID in 04_Plan
    
    # ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # 3.⁠⁠⁠ Discovery -- "How will I find or group it later?"
    # ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    tags:                               # broad, ad-hoc labels
      - #method
      - #writing
    
    topics:                              # controlled vocabulary (10-50 canonical subjects)
      - Productivity
      - Cognitive_Science
    
    summary: >                           # 1-3 sentence abstract; human-written
      Key take-aways from Cal Newport's "Deep Work" applied to my
      own schedule, plus experiment results from a 2-week sprint.
    
    keywords_auto:                       # auto-generated list, **never edited by hand**
      - deep work
      - concentration
      - distraction
      - flow state

## Rationale for each block

| Group | Field | Why it exists / How it's used | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Identity** | `uid` | One canonical reference (stable even if title changes). Use ULID/KSUID or your timestamp scheme so it sorts chronologically. | 
|  | `title / aliases` | Human readability. Aliases help Obsidian's fuzzy search & wikilinks without breaking the UID rule. | 
|  | `owner` | Needed only when multiple authors exist; a simple string keeps Git diff noise low. | 
|  | `created / updated` | Machine-parseable history; auto-maintained. | 
| **Lifecycle** | `stage` | Mirrors the folder you _should_ be in. Automation can warn if they disagree. | 
|  | `status` | Micro-state inside a stage (e.g., several drafts inside `05_Work/`). Keeps tags free. | 
|  | `project` | Fast back-link to a parent effort; text ID avoids brittle absolute paths. | 
| **Discovery** | `tags` | Free-form; you already use them for type, context, persona, etc. | 
|  | `topics` | A _controlled_ list--pre-defined vocabulary prevents tag-sprawl for major domains (e.g., "Machine_Learning" vs "ML"). | 
|  | `summary` | Search-within-YAML; fuels hover previews, graph sprinkling. | 
|  | `keywords_auto` | Solves your manual-keywords pain: a script (TF-IDF or KeyBERT) refreshes this list; since it's auto-generated you can rebuild anytime. |

## How it works in practice

1. **Creating a note**  
Your capture template pre-populates `uid`, `owner`, `created`, `stage: capture`.  
You write the H1; a linter copies it to `title` and slugifies for the filename if needed.

2. **Moving between stages**

    - Drag note to `02_Triage/` → update `stage: triage`; optionally tweak `status`.

    - Promotion to project → set `project:` and change `stage:` to `plan`.

    - Your Git hook watches for folder changes and rewrites `stage:` automatically, so manual edits are optional.

3. **During work**

    - You edit content.

    - A save hook updates `updated:` timestamp.

    - When content stabilises you change `status:` from `draft` → `review` → `final`.

4. **Shipping & learning**

    - When exported/published, move to `06_Deliver/`, set `stage: deliver`.

    - Write a quick retro; linter adds `stage: learn`.

    - Extract evergreen insights into a new note with `stage: library`.

5. **Automated keywords**  
Nightly script walks notes updated in the last 24 h, rebuilds `keywords_auto`, commits.

## Why this stays elegant

- **Only 14 keys total** -- Small enough to read at a glance.
- **Separation of concerns** -- Identity ≠ Lifecycle ≠ Discovery.
- **Automation-ready** -- Each field has a clear, single source of truth (no dual input).
- **Human-first** -- You only maintain title, aliases (rarely), tags, summary; the rest is scripted.

Feel free to rename fields (`uid` → `id`, `stage` → `life_stage`) or drop any group you won't use, but keep the block boundaries--identity / lifecycle / discovery--for long-term sanity.
