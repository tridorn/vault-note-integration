You meant: "List all additional writing/sketching/utility instruments that are not yet included in the main system but are necessary complements--nothing redundant, only what expands functionally on the current setup."

* * *

**Premise**: You already have a system designed around modular utility: expressive text (Falcon), precision markup (Microns), structural accents (Mildliners), and layout prep (Rotring). Gaps now exist only in edge-case coverage, physical maintenance, and system resilience (fail-safes, backups, scale variants).

Below is a tactical complement suite. Each item answers a specific functional shortfall in your current stack.

* * *

## I. **Erasure & Correction Instruments**

### 1. **Tombow Mono Zero (Round Tip)**

- **Role**: Precision erasing (lead under ink, margin annotations).
- **Why**: Narrow diameter lets you clean around ink without smudging it.
- **Status**: Essential. Replaces crude block erasing where ink is involved.

### 2. **Staedtler Mars Plastic**

- **Role**: Full-field erasure (planning layouts, failed sketch blocks).
- **Why**: Clean lift, no residue. Gold standard.
- **Status**: Baseline item. Mandatory for large corrections.

### 3. **White Ink Pen (Alternative)**: _Sakura Gelly Roll 10 (White)_

- **Already covered**, but reflagged here. Useful for reverse contrast, margin corrections, or post-layer highlights.
* * *

## II. **Support Writing Instruments**

### 4. **Ballpoint Pen (Needle-tip, Oil-based Ink)** -- _Uni Jetstream 0.38 or 0.5_
- **Role**: Instant-on writing where fountain pens are too slow/delicate.
- **Why**: Doesn't bleed, waterproof, writes on cheap or coated paper.
- **Status**: Non-negotiable for mobile/field contexts.

### 5. **Permanent Marker (Fine Tip)** -- _Sharpie Ultra Fine or Staedtler Lumocolor Permanent F_
- **Role**: Marking external surfaces (folders, plastics, labels).
- **Why**: No other pen in your stack writes reliably on non-paper.
- **Status**: Situational, but high leverage.
* * *

## III. **Advanced Drawing / Layout Instruments**

### 6. **Technical Pen (Refillable)** -- _Rotring Isograph 0.2 or 0.3_
- **Role**: Rigid line-drawing where Microns degrade or flex.
- **Why**: True technical pen with refillable ink; outperforms Microns over time.
- **Status**: Optional. High friction (cleaning required), only acquire if you do extended diagramming.

### 7. **Multigrade Clutch Pencil (2 mm lead)** -- _Koh-I-Noor or Staedtler Mars Technico_
- **Role**: Heavyweight sketching, expressive graphite.
- **Why**: Better for shaded concepts, layered drafting.
- **Status**: Optional. Only if you move toward figure sketching, tonal planning.
* * *

## IV. **Rulers & Guides**

### 8. **Aluminium Ruler (Non-slip, 15cm + 30cm)**
- **Role**: Clean lines for layout, tables, margin calibration.
- **Why**: Plastic bends, wood swells. Aluminium maintains edge integrity.
- **Status**: Required. Especially for diagramming or spaced writing.

### 9. **French Curve or Circle Template**

- **Role**: Non-digital curves, object sketches, icon layouts.
- **Why**: Hand-drawn curves are inconsistent. These tools reduce guesswork.
- **Status**: Optional but strategic for visual consistency.
* * *

## V. **Ink Handling & Maintenance**

### 10. **Syringe or Blunt-tip Refill Tool (for ink bottles)**

- **Role**: Precision refill of converter; avoids dipping.
- **Why**: Cleaner, less wasteful. Especially with pigmented ink.
- **Status**: Strongly advised once you use Carbon Black routinely.

### 11. **Pen Flush Solution (e.g. Goulet or J. Herbin)**

- **Role**: Clears dried ink from feed or nib.
- **Why**: Prevents ink flow degradation from pigment build-up.
- **Status**: Necessary once you go waterproof.

### 12. **Microfiber Cloth / Lint-free Wipes**

- **Role**: Clean nibs, grips, or spilled ink.
- **Why**: Paper towels shed fibers that clog feeds.
- **Status**: Low cost, high utility.
* * *

## VI. **Storage + Transport**

### 13. **Hard Pen Case (holds 6--10 pens)**

- **Role**: Protection, separation, no ink contact bleed.
- **Why**: Avoids damaging nibs or crushing tips in transit.
- **Status**: Mandatory if you carry more than 2 instruments.

### 14. **Modular Pencil Wrap or Utility Pouch**

- **Role**: Keeps leads, erasers, templates consolidated.
- **Why**: No rummaging. Keeps accessories field-ready.
- **Status**: Secondary but accelerates workflow.
* * *

## Summary Table

| Category | Item | Status | Fills What Gap | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Erasure | Mono Zero + Mars Plastic | Mandatory | Controlled + full erasure | 
| Everyday Writing | Uni Jetstream | Mandatory | Instant, durable writing | 
| Marking | Sharpie / Lumocolor Perm | Situational | Non-paper surfaces | 
| Drafting | Ruler, Clutch Pencil | Useful | Layout precision, shaded sketching | 
| Technical | Rotring Isograph | Optional | Long-term fine-line diagrams | 
| Maintenance | Syringe, Pen Flush | Required (if waterproof ink) | System longevity | 
| Storage | Pen case, pouch | Mandatory if mobile | Physical protection, order | 

* * *

**Conclusion**:  
You need five concrete additions now:

1. **Mono Zero**

2. **Mars Plastic**

3. **Jetstream 0.38**

4. **Aluminium ruler**

5. **Pen flush + syringe (if Carbon Black is used)**

Everything else is conditional: based on use case, scale, or mobility. Acquire incrementally. Avoid hoarding tools that do not solve a precise problem in your workflow.
