Better: "Produce a fixed 6-step operational checklist for migrating book notes from analogue to a structured Markdown library, optimised for high reading throughput."

  

Here's the checklist. Print it, keep it on your desk.

## 6-Step Analogue-to-Markdown Book Notes Workflow

  

1. Finish reading and mark for extraction

- Immediately after the final chapter, scan your handwritten notes.
- Highlight or flag only the 20--30% most reusable insights.
- Symbols: @ (experiment), $ (monetisation), ? (open question), ! (critical insight).

  

2. Distil the book's core thesis

- One paragraph, in your own words.
- Force yourself to state what problem this book solves and how it changes your decisions.

  

3. Extract 3--5 strategic takeaways

- Formulate as action rules: "If X, then Y" or "When in situation A, apply method B".
- Avoid vague adjectives. Tie each takeaway to a specific leverage point.

  

4. Create the Markdown file

Filename: YYYY-MM-DD_Title_Author.md

Template:
    
    
    # Book Title -- Author
    ## Date Finished: YYYY-MM-DD
    ## Core Thesis
    …
    ## 3--5 Strategic Takeaways
    - …
    ## Key Concepts
    ### Concept Name
    Summary + implications + action.
    ## Actions / Experiments
    - …
    ## Tags
    #tag1 #tag2 #tag3

Keep the file under 1,000 words.

  

5. Spawn atomic concept files

- For any idea that is standalone and reusable outside the book's context, create a file in /concepts/.
- Use bidirectional links to connect back to the source book.
- Tag consistently across all concept files.

  

6. Link and consolidate weekly

- Once a week, review /concepts/ and connect related ideas via links.
- Update thematic index files (e.g., Pricing.md, Prototyping.md).
- Archive analogue pages in /raw_notes/ with identical filenames to their Markdown counterpart.

This routine keeps the analogue stage for comprehension, forces active synthesis during migration, and preserves searchability without bloating your library.

  

Do you want me to also define a tight tagging taxonomy so your library remains scalable after 200+ books? That's where most note systems degrade.
