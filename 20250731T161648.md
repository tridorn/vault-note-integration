**Correction.** More accurately: _"Given that I am building a business while simultaneously developing a statecraft project, and wish to avoid self-promotion, how should I structure my entire public-facing identity around Dornhelm as the singular vector--project, persona, and institutional frame? What principles and practical mechanisms govern this mode of strategic invisibility?"_
* * *

### I. Strategic Posture: _Anonymised Authority Through Construct Primacy_

Your declared intent is to operate publicly, but never as a self. You are choosing a sovereign communications model: **speak only through the system you build**. This is not aesthetic minimalism. It is **authority abstraction**. Dornhelm becomes your proxy--_not your brand, your boundary_.

* * *

### II. Positioning Principle Stack

These principles govern your external operations--across business, statecraft, and intellectual surfaces.

| Principle | Description | Operational Consequence | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **1. Construct Primacy** | The project is the speaker. You never speak as a person. | Publish only through _Dornhelm_. No personal bios. No speaking appearances under your legal or pseudonymous identity. | 
| **2. Functional Obliqueness** | Your role is disclosed only as needed to operationalise trust or access. | Use role tags like "Operator," "Steward," or "Maintainer." Never "Founder" or "Creator." | 
| **3. Multiplex Identity Collapse** | Business, theory, and praxis converge under one signal. | Use Dornhelm as both intellectual engine and public mask for the business, unless incompatible with client-facing trust vectors. | 
| **4. Flat Voice Hierarchy** | All content emerges from the system, not a hero figure. | Avoid "first-person" in formal writing. Essays are voiced by the system: "This framework explores...". | 
| **5. Compartmentalised Execution** | Private life, real name, and financial/legal interfaces are sealed from public traceability. | You operate as the system's back-end, never front-facing. Digital trail is compartmentalised via air-gapped accounts and infrastructure. | 
| **6. Silence as Filtering** | You do not debate. You do not opine. You emit designed artefacts. | Zero engagement policy across platforms. No reactive output. All emissions are pre-structured and thematic. | 
* * *

### III. Practical Execution Architecture

#### 1. **Public Presence Surfaces**

| Vector | Identity Presented | Interface | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Website** | Dornhelm (no author pages, no team bios) | All content under "Dornhelm" or "The Dornhelm Institute" | 
| **Social (X, LinkedIn)** | `@Dornhelm`, "Dornhelm Institute" | Static profiles, no interactions | 
| **Business Outreach** | "Dornhelm Operator" or "Dornhelm Systems" | Contact form, encrypted mail | 
| **Eventual Product/Consulting** | "Brought to you by Dornhelm" | No personal photos, names, or team descriptions | 

#### 2. **Voice Management**

- **Internal voice** (you to inner-circle): informal, precise, clear-eyed.
- **External voice** (Dornhelm to world): formal, systemic, aperspectival.
- **Public interface**: Rare signed messages as "T. Dornhelm," never disclosing location, biography, or motivation.

#### 3. **Publishing Mechanics**

- Publish blog posts, whitepapers, and artefacts under "Dornhelm" as sole author.
- Include references like "From the Editorial Group" or "Dornhelm's design track."
- If citation is required: "Dornhelm, _Legitimacy as Performance: Civic Systems in Flux_, 2025." No personal name.

### IV. Business Integration Model

You are building a business that must operate in the real economy while your public signal architecture remains abstract and ideational.

**Two viable options:**

| Model | Description | Trade-Off | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Embedded Dornhelm** | Dornhelm _is_ the front-facing business vehicle (e.g. as a design systems consultancy, governance architecture firm, or simulation lab). | Consistency, but risks confusing ideological material with product/service offerings. | 
| **Dual Structure with Shared Membrane** | Separate business entity operates privately; Dornhelm remains the ideological front. Business clients see Dornhelm IP but transact with a legal shell. | Preserves separation; more complex paperwork. | 

**Recommended:** **Dual structure**. Keep Dornhelm public-facing as a _theory-and-design membrane_; route financial and client-side operations through a minimal legal vehicle (LLC, lab, studio). Dornhelm authors the worldview. The business instantiates it discreetly.
* * *

### V. Lifecycle Map

| Phase | Public Appearance | Internal Focus | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **0--12 mo** | Essays, salons, framework PDFs from Dornhelm | Develop corpus, surface minimum viable worldview | 
| **12--24 mo** | Institutionalize Dornhelm as think-tank/entity | Begin soft pilots, advisory relationships, client interactions under shell | 
| **24--36 mo** | Release executable frameworks (tools, simulators, OS) | Shift from publication to operational deployment, maintain voice silence | 
| **36+ mo** | Dornhelm becomes school of thought, potentially multi-author | You remain permanently obscure, replaceable, structurally non-crucial | 
* * *

### VI. Final Counsel

You don't need a persona. You need a **construct with gravity**. Dornhelm is not your "project." It is your **surrogate political and epistemic self**. Operate it accordingly. Think not: _what should I say?_ Think: _what should Dornhelm emit next to shape the terrain?_

Your job is not to be seen. It is to construct a system that cannot be ignored.
