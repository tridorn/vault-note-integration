Your inquiry could have been phrased as: "I am considering adding a 'Key Words' section to my Obsidian note-taking system. How does this concept compare with the use of tags? Could they complement each other, and if so, what are their respective roles and optimal use cases?"

Tags and a "Key Words" section can indeed complement each other, provided you define their roles with precision:

### **Tags**

- **Purpose:** Tags function as *categorical identifiers*. They are designed to group notes by thematic or hierarchical connections, often serving as meta-organizers that transcend the immediate content of a single note.
- **Best Use Cases:**
  - **Thematic Grouping:** Broad categories like `#philosophy`, `#project`, or `#meeting`.
  - **State or Status Indicators:** Tracking workflow or note status, e.g., `#draft`, `#published`.
  - **Taxonomic Layers:** Tags can work hierarchically (`#philosophy/stoicism`) to create nested classifications.
- **Strengths:** They are universally searchable and filterable across your vault, making them ideal for global organization.

### **Key Words Section**

- **Purpose:** Key words act as *semantic anchors* within the content of a specific note. They provide a snapshot of the note's essence, often tailored to highlight precise, context-dependent terms.
- **Best Use Cases:**
  - **Content Summarization:** A quick, human-readable index of the note's core topics (e.g., "cognitive biases, virtue ethics").
  - **Focused Retrieval:** A tool for disambiguating notes with similar themes but distinct nuances.
  - **Personalized Weighting:** Allows you to emphasize terms that are *important to you* but might not be significant enough for a tag.
- **Strengths:** More flexible and granular than tags, key words can serve as an intuitive, note-specific search enhancer when used in combination with full-text search.

### **How They Complement Each Other**

1. **Macro vs. Micro:** Tags handle macro-organization across notes, while key words focus on micro-level specificity within individual notes.
2. **Hierarchical Taxonomy vs. Flat Indexing:** Tags create hierarchical structures; key words serve as a flat, on-demand index of terms.
3. **Automation vs. Manual Curation:** Tags integrate well with automation (e.g., Dataview queries, graph views), while key words demand thoughtful manual input, encouraging deeper engagement with the note’s content.
4. **Search Optimization:** Key words amplify full-text search by creating a middle ground between broad tags and the granularity of free-form text.

### **Recommended Focus**

- Use **tags** for *meta-organizational logic*: high-level themes, workflows, and broad categories.
- Use a **Key Words section** to capture *semantic essence*: precise terms, unique identifiers, or phrases pivotal to the note’s substance.

For example, in a note on Stoic ethics:
- **Tags:** `#philosophy`, `#stoicism`, `#ethics`.
- **Key Words:** "virtue ethics, Epictetus, eudaimonia, dichotomy of control."

By doing so, you gain the hierarchical strength of tags and the semantic precision of key words, yielding a more robust and nuanced system.
