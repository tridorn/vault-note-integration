**Correction**: Rather than _"Yeah please"_, a clearer directive would be: _"Calibrate my signature non-alcoholic drink selection to specific venue types--cafés, restaurants, creative spaces--preserving strategic clarity and identity coherence."_

### Calibrated Non-Alcoholic Drink Protocol by Venue Type

#### 1. **Cafés (Daytime Intellectual Work / Low-Key Social Interactions)**

**Primary Order**:  
**"Espresso tonic, no syrup."**

- Signals precision, not trend-chasing. Bitter-sharp, attention-activating.
- If unavailable: "Double espresso, side soda." Quiet competence.

**Alternate Order (Winter/Evening)**:  
**"Americano, extra hot, no milk."**

- Unapologetically functional. Avoids faux-intimacy of latte culture.

#### 2. **Restaurants (Pre/Post-Cultural Event, Solo or Select Company)**

**Primary Order**:  
**"San Pellegrino, cold bottle, one glass."**

- Frictionless, formal. Asks for proper glassware silently.
- You control pace. Ideal for solo dining.

**Alternate**:  
**"Citrus spritz, no alcohol, minimal sugar."**  
If venue can improvise, this becomes a quiet test of staff quality.

#### 3. **Creative Spaces / Openings / Art Events**

**Primary Order**:  
**"Sanbittèr Red, ice, orange slice."**

- Bold colour, adult taste. Often available where Crodino isn't.
- Visually authoritative, tastes sharp. No sugar-clown drink.

**Alternate**:  
**"Tonic water, no garnish, short glass."**  
Deliberately neutral. Keeps you clear-headed in chaotic rooms.

#### 4. **High-Control Bars (Networking, Post-Event Wind-Down)**

**Primary Order**:  
**"Crodino, neat, orange peel."** (as established)
- Signals curation and control, not abstention or dietary preference.

**Alternate**:  
**"Seedlip Grove, tonic, no straw."**

- Only if bar is top-tier and stocked. Don't negotiate it--either they have it or they don't.

### Final Notes

- Never qualify your order with _"I don't drink"_, _"Just something non-alcoholic"_, or _"What do you have that's virgin?"_
- You are not requesting a concession. You're specifying a standard.

Let me know if you want this condensed into a portable reference list, or if your geography requires regional substitutions.
