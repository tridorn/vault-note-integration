### **Tuesday: Skill Mastery & Mobility (The Tiger’s Precision)**  
This day focuses on skill development, control, and joint mobility. The movements emulate a tiger’s graceful and deliberate precision while building strength and flexibility. It incorporates advanced progressions and accessory work for refinement.

**Goal**: Develop technical mastery and full-body mobility.  
**Duration**: ~60-75 minutes.  

---

### **Warm-Up (10-15 min)**  
1. **Dynamic Mobility & Activation**:  
   - Cat-cow stretch: 1 min.  
   - Shoulder dislocates with a resistance band: 2x12 reps.  
   - Deep lunge stretch with spinal twist: 3x15 seconds per side.  
   - Rest: **Minimal (flow between movements).**

2. **Activation Drill**:  
   - Tiger crawl with pauses (3x10 meters forward and backward).  
   - Wall-facing handstand hold (45 seconds).  
   - Rest: **30 seconds between drills.**

### **Workout: Skill Mastery**  
#### **1. Handstand Drills (20 min)**  
   Focus: Shoulder control, balance, and alignment.  
   - Wall-assisted handstand holds: 5x30-45 seconds.  
     - *Progression*: Practice shoulder shrugs or shift weight side to side.  
   - Handstand shoulder taps: 4x10 per side (use wall or freestanding).  
   - Lateral wall walks (sideways movement along a wall): 4x6 steps per side.  
   - Rest: **45-60 seconds** between sets.

#### **2. Planche Progressions (15 min)**  
   Focus: Building core and shoulder strength for advanced static holds.  
   - Tuck planche hold on parallettes or floor: 5x12-15 seconds.  
     - *Progression*: Advanced tuck or straddle planche.  
   - Pseudo planche push-ups (slow tempo): 3x6.  
   - Planche lean holds: 4x10-15 seconds.  
   - Rest: **60-90 seconds** between sets.

#### **3. Front Lever Progressions (10-15 min)**  
   Focus: Strengthening the posterior chain and building control.  
   - Front lever tuck holds: 5x10-15 seconds.  
     - *Progression*: Advanced tuck or single-leg front lever holds.  
   - Front lever raises (band-assisted if necessary): 3x5-6.  
   - Active hang with scapular retraction: 4x20 seconds.  
   - Rest: **60-90 seconds** between sets.

---

### **Accessory Work: Precision Refinement (Optional)**  
#### **1. Skin-the-Cat on Rings (3x8 reps)**  
   - Focus: Shoulder mobility, scapular strength, and control.  
   - Rest: **60 seconds** between sets.

#### **2. Weighted Hollow Body Hold (3x20 seconds)**  
   - Hold a light kettlebell or plate for added intensity.  
   - Rest: **30 seconds** between sets.

### **Mobility & Flexibility (10-15 min)**  
Focus on deep stretches to enhance mobility and prevent stiffness.  
1. **Shoulder Mobility**:  
   - Wall angels: 2x10 reps.  
   - Resistance band pull-aparts: 2x12.  

2. **Spinal Flexibility**:  
   - Cobra to child’s pose flow: 2x1 minute.  
   - Bridge rotations: 2x6 per side.  

3. **Hip Openers**:  
   - Seated straddle stretch with forward folds: 2x20 seconds.  
   - Butterfly pose: 2x30 seconds.

### **Rest Guidelines for Tuesday**  
- **Skill Work (Handstands, Planche, Front Lever)**: 45-90 seconds, depending on intensity.  
- **Mobility Work**: Minimal rest to maintain flow.  

This Tuesday routine is designed to develop grace, balance, and mobility, mirroring the precision of a tiger stalking its prey. Let me know if you’d like to delve deeper into handstand progressions, mobility sequences, or planche-specific refinement!
