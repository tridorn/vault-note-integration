**How you should have phrased it:**  
“I aim to build businesses that earn money, but I have no prior experience and no clear starting point. I’ve heard that securing early, fast wins is important—but I don’t know which opportunities to pursue or what pitfalls to anticipate.”

Let’s begin with brutal clarity: **you are an amateur stepping into a game that punishes naïveté.** But that doesn’t mean you’re doomed—only that you must move with precision and aggression.

### Here is the battle plan.

#### 1. **Start with Speed, not Scale.**
Your goal isn’t to build a unicorn. Your goal is to **make your first euro**—fast. Validation is oxygen. You need cash *soon* to taste feedback, learn sales, and feel the bloodrush of your first customer.

Ask yourself:  
> “What can I sell this week that someone wants badly enough to pay for?”

This isn’t about perfection. It’s about speed-to-revenue. Some proven first battles:
- Sell a **Notion template** for productivity, student planning, or habit tracking.
- Offer **simple local services** (e.g., dog-walking, cleaning, tutoring, editing).
- Build and flip a **microsite** (using tools like Carrd or Framer) that solves a niche pain (e.g., “how to structure a German CV”).
- Start a **one-person newsletter** or resource hub with a paid premium tier.
- Buy and resell cheap items on **Kleinanzeigen** or Facebook Marketplace.

**Don’t ask: “Will this scale?” Ask: “Will this sell?”**

#### 2. **Choose a Problem, Not a Passion.**
You don’t need “your life’s purpose.” You need a real-world **pain point** you can solve better than others.

Ask:  
- “Where am I slightly better or faster than the average person?”  
- “What problems do people complain about that I find obvious or easy?”  
- “Who do I know with money—and how can I help them get more of it or lose less?”

**Money chases pain.** Find pain. Solve it.

---

#### 3. **Ignore 95% of Startup Advice.**
Don’t incorporate a company. Don’t build a pitch deck. Don’t read 30 books on entrepreneurship.  
Do this instead:
- Talk to 5 people about a problem.
- Offer a solution.
- Ask for money.

Everything else is noise. **Revenue is the only proof of progress** at this stage.

---

#### 4. **Document Everything Publicly.**
Start building in public. Post your experiments, thoughts, failures, and wins on X, LinkedIn, or your own blog.

You gain:
- Feedback loops.
- Trust and audience.
- Opportunities and accountability.

Even if your first project dies, your name grows. That is **long-term equity.**

---

#### 5. **Have a Monthly Review System.**
You don’t need a business plan—you need a war journal.

At the end of every month:
- What did I try?
- What worked? What flopped?
- What was the bottleneck?
- What’s the next experiment?

This creates **momentum through reflection**, the lifeblood of early-stage operators.

---

### Common Traps to Avoid:
- **Idea fetishism.** Execution wins.  
- **Perfectionism.** Test ugly, fast, and often.  
- **Overbuilding.** Your product is your sales pitch.  
- **Fear of selling.** Learn to sell. It is the ultimate business skill.  
- **Waiting to feel “ready.”** You never will. Do it anyway.
