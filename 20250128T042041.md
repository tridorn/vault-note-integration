You‚Äôre absolutely correct: **tasks for a project should primarily relate to its current stage** to maintain focus and avoid overloading your system with unnecessary details. Below, I‚Äôll explain how to handle **planning and review stages**, whether to create every possible action upfront, and how to manage sequential tasks effectively.

---

## **1. Tasks and Project Stages**

Each stage of a project should guide the types of tasks you create. Here‚Äôs how to approach different stages, including **planning** and **review**:

### **a. Ideation Stage**

- **Goal**: Explore and define the project concept.
- **Tasks**:
  - Brainstorm ideas or requirements.
  - Conduct preliminary research.
  - Write a project description or outline.
- **Key Rule**: Keep tasks minimal and high-level; avoid detailed task creation until the project moves to **planning**.

---

### **b. Planning Stage**

- **Goal**: Break the project into actionable steps and define a roadmap.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create broad milestones or major categories of work (e.g., "Complete research," "Write draft").
  - Identify dependencies (e.g., "Finish Chapter 1 before Chapter 2").
  - Draft timelines, schedules, or resource plans.
- **Key Rule**: Focus on **high-level actions**:
  - Do not create every single task upfront‚Äîjust the next few steps or broad categories.
  - For sequential tasks, create only the **first actionable step** and note dependencies for later review.
  - Example:
	 - Current Task: "Read Chapter 1."
	 - Note: "After Chapter 1 ‚Üí Read Chapter 2."

---

### **c. Execution Stage**

- **Goal**: Carry out the planned work.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create actionable steps based on the project plan or milestone.
  - Add tasks dynamically as the project evolves.
- **Key Rule**: Always have at least one **next action** ready, but avoid overloading your system with long, sequential lists of tasks.

---

### **d. Review Stage**

- **Goal**: Assess progress, resolve blockers, and adjust plans.
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct retrospectives (e.g., "What went well, what can improve").
  - Identify incomplete tasks or blockers.
  - Update the Kanban board to reflect progress (e.g., move tasks to "Blocked" or "Done").
- **Key Rule**: Review stages often lead to updates in the **planning** or **execution** stages, so use tasks to capture insights and define the next steps.

---

### **e. Other Stages (Delivery, Maintenance, Closure)**

- These stages are more outcome-focused, where tasks relate to final deliverables (e.g., "Submit final report") or ongoing updates (e.g., "Review website performance monthly").

---

## **2. Should You Create Every Action You Can Think Of?**

**No**, you shouldn‚Äôt create every action upfront. Instead, use a **progressive planning approach** that balances clarity with flexibility. Here‚Äôs how:

### **Why Not Create All Tasks Upfront?**

1. **Avoid Overload**:
	- Long lists of tasks can overwhelm you and clutter your system.
	- Many tasks will change or become irrelevant as the project evolves.

2. **Maintain Flexibility**:
	- Projects often take unexpected turns. Planning every detail upfront locks you into assumptions that may no longer apply.

3. **Focus on the Next Action**:
	- GTD emphasizes capturing only the **next actionable step**, allowing you to adjust as you complete tasks.

---

### **When To Create Sequential Tasks**

For sequential work (e.g., reading chapters of a book or completing stages of a design), follow these rules:

#### **a. Start with the First Action**

- Create only the first step that can currently be done.
- Example:
  - Task: "Read Chapter 1."
  - Note: "After this, proceed to Chapter 2."

#### **b. Use Notes or Project Documents**

- Document sequential tasks as a reference, but don‚Äôt turn them into actionable tasks until the preceding steps are completed.
- Example:
  - Project Notes:
	 - "Read Chapter 1."
	 - "Read Chapter 2."
	 - "Write summary of chapters."

#### **c. Create New Actions Dynamically**

- After completing a task, review the project and add the next logical step.
- Example:
  - After "Read Chapter 1," create the task "Read Chapter 2."

#### **d. Exceptions for Critical Deadlines**

- If all steps must be completed by a fixed date, create the sequential tasks upfront but assign only the **first step** to an active list.
- Example:
  - Task: "Read Chapter 1" (`Today`).
  - Future Task: "Read Chapter 2" (`Due in 3 Days`).

## **3. Handling Relationships Between Tasks and Projects**

To manage the relationship between tasks and projects effectively:

### **a. Use Tags or Linked References**

- Tag tasks with the project name or reference the project in the task description (e.g., `#ProjectName` or "[Project: Write Research Paper]").

### **b. Track Dependencies in Project Notes**

- Maintain a simple dependency list in your project documentation.
- Example:
  - "Task A ‚Üí Task B ‚Üí Task C."
  - Highlight the current actionable task (`Task A`).

### **c. Use Your Kanban System for Project-Level Progress**

- Let the Kanban system show overall project status.
- Use tasks in your GTD system to handle the granular, day-to-day work.

## **4. How to Work With This System in Practice**

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide for your daily and weekly workflows:

### **Daily Workflow**

1. **Review Overviews**:
	- Start with `Today`, `High Priority`, and `Flagged` lists to identify key tasks.
2. **Execute Tasks by Context**:
	- Use primary and secondary contexts to guide task execution (e.g., `üõ°Ô∏è Focus` for deep work, `Call` for phone tasks).
3. **Add New Tasks Dynamically**:
	- After completing a task, create the next action if applicable.

### **Weekly Workflow**

1. **Project Review**:
	- Check all active projects in the Kanban system:
	  - Move completed projects to the next stage.
	  - Identify next steps for stalled or blocked projects.
2. **Task Review**:
	- Ensure each active project has at least one actionable task in your system.
	- Add tasks for newly active projects (e.g., moving from planning to execution).
3. **Clean Up**:
	- Archive or defer irrelevant tasks.

---

## **5. Final Recommendations**

1. **Focus on Current Stage**:
	- Only create tasks related to the current project stage (planning, execution, etc.).
2. **Create Tasks Incrementally**:
	- Don‚Äôt overload your system with every possible action upfront. Add tasks dynamically as the project progresses.
3. **Leverage Notes for Sequentials**:
	- Document sequential tasks in project notes, but activate them one at a time.
4. **Use Reviews to Adjust**:
	- Weekly reviews ensure you‚Äôre capturing the right tasks without losing sight of dependencies.

By limiting task creation to what‚Äôs actionable now, you‚Äôll keep your system focused and manageable while still accommodating the flexibility needed for complex projects. Let me know if you‚Äôd like help refining this further!
