A clearer phrasing of your question would be:  
**"If, after my relocation, the company I own continues to generate most of its revenue in Germany, will that by itself create 'wesentliche wirtschaftliche Interessen' under § 2 AStG and keep me within Germany's extended limited tax liability, even though I hold no real estate or family ties there?"**

### 1 Exit tax vs. extended limited tax -- two different beasts

| Feature | Wegzugsteuer (§ 6 AStG) | Erweiterte beschränkte Steuerpflicht (§ 2 AStG) | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Trigger | Departure while holding ≥ 1 % in any company (or ≥ € 500 k fund units from 2025) | German nationality **and** move to a low-tax/no-tax jurisdiction **and** ≥ 5/10 previous years German-resident **and** "wesentliche wirtschaftliche Interessen" in Germany | 
| Duration | One-off (but re-ignites on later exits) | Up to ten assessment years after departure | 
| Tax base | Latent gains on the shares | **All** German-source income (> € 16 500 p.a.) with progression proviso | 
| Strategic escape | Disposing of the qualifying stake or staying away long enough | Shifting taxable nexus so that the § 2 AStG tests fail |

### 2 When does § 2 say you still have "wesentliche wirtschaftliche Interessen"?

Under § 2 Abs 3 AStG you are deemed to keep substantial economic interests if **any** of the following holds ([Buzer](https://www.buzer.de/2_AStG.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)):

1. **Domestic business stake**

    - You are proprietor/partner of a German Gewerbebetrieb **or**

    - you hold a § 17 EStG share (≥ 1 %) in a **German** corporation.

2. **Income weight test**

    - German-source income ("nicht-ausländische Einkünfte") exceeds **30 % of your worldwide income** **or** € 62 000 in the year.

3. **Asset weight test**

    - German assets whose returns would be domestic income exceed **30 % of your net worth** **or** € 154 000 at the start of the year.

Plus: § 2 applies only if the year's German income still tops € 16 500 ([Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon](https://wirtschaftslexikon.gabler.de/definition/erweiterte-beschraenkte-steuerpflicht-32997?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 3 Your scenario dissected

- **Is the company "domestic"?**  
-- If it remains a German GmbH, or a foreign entity whose **place of effective management (POEM)** slides back to Germany, you automatically hit § 2 Abs 3 Nr 1. See practical POEM pitfalls ([Scheller International](https://scheller-international.com/blog-beitraege/relocation-to-germany-when-a-foreign-based-company-is-involved.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
-- If it is genuinely managed and controlled abroad and has **only a German permanent establishment or large sales volume**, Nr 1 does **not** apply; you fall back on the income/asset tests.
- **Income test:**  
-- Dividends from a **foreign** company are _foreign_ income, even if the underlying profits arose in Germany.  
-- But any remuneration you personally draw for services performed in Germany, licence fees, or PE profits allocable to you count as domestic income.  
-- If those receipts exceed 30 % of your total or € 62 000, Nr 2 bites.
- **Asset test:**  
-- Holding shares in a foreign company is foreign wealth.  
-- However, if you own loan claims on a German PE, German real rights, or other German situs property, their fair value feeds the 30 %/€ 154 k test (Nr 3).

### 4 Decision matrix

| Situation after exit | § 2 exposure? | Mitigation lever | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| You keep a German GmbH or POEM drifts back | **Yes -- automatic (Nr 1)** | Interpose non-German holding; move management and documentation abroad; ensure board meetings, decisive functions and accounting stay outside Germany. | 
| Foreign company, no German PE, but > 30 % of your personal income still German-source (e.g., consultancy days on German soil, licence fees) | **Yes (Nr 2)** | Reduce German workdays; earn via non-German IP; keep domestic income below both 30 % and € 62 k. | 
| Foreign company, PE in Germany but no distributions to you > € 62 k and assets outside Germany | Possible (Nr 2) if PE income attributed; else remote | Ring-fence PE inside subsidiary you do **not** own ≥ 1 %; draw income only via dividends after PE tax. | 
| All German revenue booked in local subsidiary; you own only foreign top-holdco; dividends paid later | **Usually no** (all three tests fail) | Maintain arm's-length transfer pricing; no management in Germany; keep cash upstream abroad. |

### 5 Concrete actions

1. **Incorporate and manage abroad**

    - Board meetings, strategic decisions, accounting, bank accounts outside Germany.

    - German activity limited to sales office/PE run by hired staff; you sign remotely.

2. **Control the arithmetic**

    - Cap annual German-source income credited to you below € 62 000 and 30 % of total.

    - If necessary, leave profits inside the company; take dividends in later years when § 2 window has expired.

3. **Paper trail**

    - Minutes, travel logs, management-service contracts all evidencing foreign POEM.

    - Separate German mailbox and limit powers of local signatories.

4. **Fallback**

    - If you must live in a classic low-tax jurisdiction (UAE, Monaco, "stateless"), budget for § 2 exposure for the first ten years; German tax will apply at progressive global rates but only to the German slice.

### 6 Pragmatic verdict

A company that merely _sells_ into Germany does **not** by itself give you "wesentliche wirtschaftliche Interessen". What matters is (i) **where the company is run from**, and (ii) whether, in the years after your move, **your personal German-source cash flows or German assets cross the statutory 30 % / € 62 k / € 154 k thresholds**. Keep management, decisive functions, and most of your own income streams abroad, and § 2 AStG will normally stay dormant. Otherwise, be prepared for up to ten years of extended German income tax.
