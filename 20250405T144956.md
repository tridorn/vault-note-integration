**Better phrased:**  
How does a visionary Emperor like Vitellius unleash the Proclamation of the New Age across an empire stretching from the fog-choked forests of Germania to the sands of Syria? How does he orchestrate not just the transmission of law—but the *birth of myth*?

The rollout must be **theatrical, strategic, layered**—a symphony of awe, fear, and inevitability. This is how you execute it:

---

### **I. The Central Spectacle – Rome Itself**

**Day 1: Forum Romanum – The Epicenter**

- At dawn, **the Flame of Roma** is kindled on the Capitoline Hill, declared *never to be extinguished again*.
- The **Herald of the New Age**, draped in crimson and gold, reads the *Proclamatio Aetatis Novae* before the people and the Senate.
- Legionaries form a perimeter, not as a threat—but as an **embodied frame of authority**.
- A **triumphal eagle standard**, forged anew, is raised above the Forum—replacing the old SPQR banner.

**Nightfall:** Fireworks and ritual games. Every major street holds torchlit readings. Statues of the old emperors are veiled—**Rome now looks only forward.**

---

### **II. The Symbolic Core – 12 Imperial Cities**

**Within 10 Days:** The Proclamation is dispatched via **Imperial Couriers** to 12 designated cities—each symbolic of a Roman principle. These include:

- **Alexandria** (Wisdom)  
- **Carthago** (Memory)  
- **Lugdunum** (Unity)  
- **Antioch** (Watchfulness)  
- **Ephesus** (Divinity)  
- **Tarraco** (Strength)  
- **Byzantium** (Destiny)  

Each city must:  
- Construct a **temporary Arch of Flame**, where the Herald of the New Age reads the Proclamation.  
- Host a **5-day festival**, mixing local culture with Roman rites: games, races, feasts.  
- Begin carving the **Aquila Domini** into their temples and gates.

**Every governor must swear the Loyalty Oath publicly**, on the *Imperial Flame*, in front of the populace.

### **III. The Provincial Surge – A 3-Month Operation**

#### **Logistics Command:**
The Curia Regiminis deploys **teams of scribes, heralds, engineers, and priests**—called the *Flamens of the Flame*—to each province. Think of them as spiritual-construction-political envoys.

#### **Key Tactics:**

- **Scripts & Rituals** pre-designed for each region's language and customs, but always leading back to *Roma Aeterna*.
- **Public Oath Ceremonies** in local amphitheaters, where every able-bodied male citizen swears loyalty with hand on flame-lit eagle standard.
- **Coins** minted with the face of the Emperor on one side, the *Flamma Aeterna* (Eternal Flame) on the other, dropped en masse during festivals.

---

### **IV. The Military Layer – Doctrine and Steel**

- All legionary camps conduct the **Night of the Flame**, where soldiers burn the old banners and receive **new eagle standards named for virtues**.
- A *Vow of the Sword* is instituted—legionaries must affirm, aloud and recorded, that their sword is now “**bound to the will of the Dominus**.”

Field commanders must:
- Send formal declarations of acceptance.  
- Execute one public example of a dissenter, recorded and relayed back to Rome.

---

### **V. The Temple Network – The Spiritual Binding**

- Temples to *Roma et Imperator* are ordered in every provincial capital. Until then, temporary altars are erected.
- A **ritual calendar** is introduced—nine annual festivals tied to the Emperor’s reign, such as:
  - *Dies Flammae* – Day of the Flame  
  - *Natalis Imperii* – Founding Day  
  - *Vigilantia Noctis* – Night of Watchfulness

Each is designed to **bind the spiritual life of the Empire to the person of the Emperor**.

---

### **VI. Information Control – Memory Engineering**

- **Imperial Historians** are dispatched with the heralds. Their job is to write and *overwrite* the narrative—Vitellius as restorer, redeemer, founder.
- Copies of **"The First Decree"** (the public version of the Proclamation) are carved into stone and placed at city gates and in major forums.
- **Graffiti squads** are employed—painting slogans like:
  - *“Roma has Awakened.”*  
  - *“The Flame Sees You.”*  
  - *“Old Rome is Ash. The New Rome Rises.”*

---

### **VII. The Silent Layer – Enforcement and Surveillance**

- With each envoy group travels a **small cohort of the Oculi Imperii**—the Eyes of the Empire.
- Their role: **monitor** local elite reactions, **identify dissent**, and if needed, **remove obstacles quietly**.

Each province sends a **Loyalty Ledger** back to Rome:
- Names of those who led the oath.  
- Reports on crowd reaction.  
- Any signs of resistance.

---

### **Final Touch: The Empire as Stage**

The entire rollout is engineered like a **traveling imperial liturgy**—a unified sequence of rites that make the Empire feel *sacred, reborn, inevitable*.

This is not a memo. This is **a new Roman religion**, whose gospel is power, whose god is Order, whose prophet is Vitellius.

Want to turn this into a living campaign? I can create a province-by-province rollout schedule, name the heralds, generate inscriptions, even simulate resistance hotbeds and how you’d crush or co-opt them. Or reconstruct how this would unfold in *one* city, down to the speeches, ceremonies, and architecture.
