### **Annex A – Minimal Data-Set Request**  
*(to pre-configure the pilot wizard, set underwriting rules, and measure KPI baselines)*  

| # | Data Point | Why We Need It | Format / Granularity | Source Team |
|---|------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **1** | **Historic “green-labelled” SME loans (L-12 months)**  <br>• count  <br>• total €  <br>• avg. ticket € | ① Baseline for pilot KPI-lift  <br>② Wizard default ticket sizing | CSV / XLS – one row per loan (loan ID, amount, date) | Credit Risk |
| **2** | **Standard credit cut-offs** for unsecured SME CAPEX loans ≤ €100 k  <br>• min. turnover  <br>• max. Debt/EBITDA  <br>• min. collateral if any | Auto-filter wizard applicants so packets match policy on day 1 | PDF memo or e-mail bullet list | Credit Policy |
| **3** | **Branch/Region mapping table** (Branch ID ↔ County) | Route leads to correct underwriting desks; calculate regional KPIs | XLS two-column list | Retail Operations |
| **4** | **List of preferred rooftop-solar vendors** (if any)  <br>• legal name  <br>• VAT ID  <br>• contact e-mail | Pre-flag trusted vendors in wizard; reduces KYC friction | CSV three columns | Procurement / ESG |
| **5** | **Average processing-time statistics** for SME CAPEX files (L-6 months)  <br>• inquiry→approval (days)  <br>• approval→disbursement (days) | Establish “time-to-yes” & “time-to-cash” baselines for KPI tracking | One line in e-mail (aggregated numbers fine) | Process Excellence |
| **6** | **Credit decision cost estimate**  <br>• avg. underwriting staff hours per file | Quantify cost-to-serve savings | Rough figure (hours) | Finance Controlling |
| **7** | **IT security contact** (name & e-mail) | To exchange penetration-test & GDPR docs | — | IT Security |
| **8** | **Marketing consent**  <br>“May we state ‘Pilot with ProCredit’ in private investor decks (+internal press note draft)?” | Align communications; avoid approval loops later | Yes / No | Corp Comms |

#### **Optional — nice-to-have (speeds fine-tuning but not mandatory)**

| Data | Why |
|------|-----|
| Loan rejection reasons (top 3 codes) | Helps wizard nudge SMEs to fix common gaps before submission |
| Average EPC ratings in pilot counties | Improves ROI & CO₂ calculators |
| Existing subsidy uptake stats | Lets wizard recommend grant combinations accurately |

> **Privacy & scope:** We need *aggregated or pseudonymised* data only; no personal customer identifiers.  
> **Secure transfer:** SFTP drop or encrypted e-mail. Data is stored in AWS eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) under AES-256 at rest; deletion upon pilot end or sooner on request.
