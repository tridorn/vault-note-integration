The request, stated with executive clarity, would be: "Identify other advanced, everyday gadgets that match the GL-iNet Beryl AX in power-user appeal."

Selection criteria: augment personal autonomy (energy, data, security), exploit modern protocols (USB-C PD 3.1, Wi-Fi 6/6E, FIDO2), and offer tangible leverage with minimal sentimentality. Below, each device is assessed on benefit, integration potential, and latent cost.

1. **Anker Prime 27 650 mAh/250 W power bank** -- A mobile energy buffer that can fast-charge a 16-inch laptop at 140 W while still feeding two smaller devices. Integrated LCD telemetry gives real-time voltage and cycle data, useful for spotting cable losses or battery fatigue. Downside: 730 g mass; airlines may query its 99 Wh rating on carry-on inspections.([androidcentral.com](https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-prime-27650mah-250w-power-bank-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

2. **Ugreen Nexode 300 W GaN desktop charger (5× USB: 4 C, 1 A)** -- Consolidates an entire workstation's load behind a single 2-metre power cord and delivers PD-3.1 at up to 140 W on port 1. Ideal pairing with the Prime bank for bidirectional fast-recharge. Trade-off: bulk and heat; its 300 W ceiling is theoretical unless mains wiring is equally robust.([chargerlab.com](https://www.chargerlab.com/review-of-ugreen-300w-nexode-5-in-1-charger/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [xda-developers.com](https://www.xda-developers.com/ugreen-nexode-300w-charger-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3. **YubiKey 5C NFC** -- Hardware root-of-trust that eliminates phishing vectors and password reuse. Multiprotocol support (FIDO2, PGP, OTP) makes it the portable equivalent of an HSM. Keep one on-body; cold-store a clone off-site. Limitation: browser-based WebAuthn UX remains inconsistent on certain mobile OS builds.([ragnarheil.de](https://ragnarheil.de/yubikey-5c-nfc-review-my-journey-with-hardware-security-keys/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

4. **Flipper Zero** -- Sub-GHz, NFC, IR, and Bluetooth LE transceiver for diagnostics, red-team rehearsal, and quick RF environment audits. Useful for confirming that hotel IoT devices are not exfiltrating via unauthorized channels while your Beryl AX is in repeater mode. Possession invites scrutiny at border control; maintain firmware within official repos to avoid seizure.([linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-experience-flipper-zero-roman-reznikov-phd--kq2nf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

5. **Samsung T9 Portable SSD (USB 3.2 Gen2×2, 20 Gb/s)** -- Sustained 1 GB/s throughput enables on-the-road VM cloning or 4K footage editing without internal-drive wear. Physical resilience to 3 m drops offsets the absence of IP-rating. Encrypt at the file-system level; the bundled software is superfluous.([digitalcitizen.life](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/samsung-t9-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [pcgamer.com](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/ssds/samsung-t9-external-ssd-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

6. **Synology BeeStation Plus (8 TB personal cloud)** -- An entry-NAS that boots to a working share in <10 min and now runs Plex natively. Ideal for sovereign file history when you are off-grid with the Beryl AX: point WireGuard back home and retain full data custody. Constraint: single-drive architecture; treat it as a live mirror, not archival storage.([dongknows.com](https://dongknows.com/synology-beestation-plus-review/))

Strategic implication chain:  
• Prime + Nexode removes AC-adapter sprawl, ensuring every other device on this list remains operable.  
• YubiKey and BeeStation erect hard perimeter defences--identity and data--independent of SaaS providers.  
• Flipper Zero and the Beryl AX jointly convert any transient network into a transparent, inspectable asset.  
• T9 supplies high-speed local scratch space, reducing reliance on cloud egress bandwidth.

Acquire in the order above if budget-constrained; energy sovereignty is the foundational leverage point.
