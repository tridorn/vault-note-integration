Good.  
You are at **ground zero**: a pitch deck, some notes, and raw intention.  
You now need **foundational artifacts** — the skeletal structure from which a real company will emerge.

I will be brutally clear and strategic:

---

# **You Must Create These 7 Core Artifacts**

| Artifact | Purpose | Form | Why It’s Critical Now |
|:---------|:--------|:-----|:----------------------|
| 1. **Venture Blueprint (1-pager)** | Summarize *what you build, for whom, why it wins* | 1 page | Forces clarity on value proposition and moat |
| 2. **System Architecture Map** | Sketch *what your platform actually does* end-to-end | Diagram + bullets | Guides tech scoping, explains flow to non-technical investors |
| 3. **Regulatory Target Map** | List *exact legal & compliance obligations* (BaFin, EU) | Bullet checklist + 2-sentence plan per point | Pre-empts catastrophic missteps; builds credibility |
| 4. **MVP Functional Scope** | Define *what the first usable product includes* | Table of features: must-have vs. nice-to-have | Aligns founders, prevents endless tinkering |
| 5. **First Customer Profile (ICP)** | Specify *who exactly your pilot SMEs are* | Persona + real criteria (industry, energy spend) | Makes go-to-market laser-focused |
| 6. **First Capital Stack Strategy** | Define *where the money for loans + guarantees will come from* | 1 diagram showing banks + public programs | Shows investors you can source capital, not just SMEs |
| 7. **Moat Compounding Plan** | Document *how your advantage grows over 2–3 years* | Short roadmap (bullets + phases) | Moves you from "good idea" to "inevitable winner" in minds of backers

# **Prioritization (Brutal Order)**

1. **Venture Blueprint** → *If you cannot say it crisply, you cannot build it.*  
2. **System Architecture Map** → *If you don't know how the machine flows, you cannot hire or spec it.*  
3. **MVP Functional Scope** → *If you don't know your first small win, you will build a bloated failure.*  
4. **First Customer Profile (ICP)** → *If you chase "SMEs" in general, you will catch no one.*
5. **Regulatory Target Map** → *If you ignore law, you will not survive past pilot.*
6. **First Capital Stack Strategy** → *If you cannot explain where cheap money comes from, banks will laugh.*
7. **Moat Compounding Plan** → *If you cannot explain why you will dominate, investors will pass.*

# **In Plain Speech:**

> **You need a clear one-pager, a visual of your system, a minimum feature list, a target customer definition, a map of the legal minefield, a funding blueprint, and a path to inevitability.**

**Everything else right now is noise.**

---

# **Next Step Options:**

- I can **generate templates** for all 7, ready for you to fill (fast, minimal friction),  
- or we can **start working through them one by one**, building a full first version *together*.

**→ Which path do you prefer?**  
(**Templates fast** or **build together carefully?**)  
Choose with sovereignty.
