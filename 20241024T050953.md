# On Every New Project',' Create A Note for Everything Related

--- 

## What it Means

The title stresses that it has to be for every note, but this is just to get the point across. In reality one can create the note whenever the need arises, but is not obliged to do so. This note is also more of a helper or scratchpad for everything that might help to complete the [[Projects in Task System|project]]. It is especially useful to apply some or all of the steps of the [[Natural Planning Method]] and create a [[definition of done]].

The here described note is not really an overview of the project, or there to be part of the [[Task System]] or provide literally any kind of documentation, its only or rather primary goal is to assist *during* the project. It is not designed to provide any future reference.

## Title Naming Convention

The note bears the same title as the project it refers to with a "Project:" prefixed. It also should be tagged with `#project` in the frontmatter.

## What to Do After Conclusion of the Project

After the project has wrapped up, [[2024-03-15-15-34-08|Add Archived Property',' Access and Tag on Archiving of a File]] and properly archive the file.
