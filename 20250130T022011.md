Creating an ETF portfolio for a European investor involves considering different factors, such as regulatory constraints, tax implications, and the availability of ETFs. European investors often prefer UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) compliant ETFs due to their strong investor protection standards. Here's a sample portfolio allocation that could be suitable for a young European investor who is comfortable with a higher risk profile:

1. **Global Equities (50%)**
	- **U.S. Equities (20%)**: Invest in a UCITS-compliant S&P 500 ETF to gain exposure to the American market. Example: iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF (CSPX).
	- **European Equities (15%)**: Gain exposure to major European corporations to capitalize on local growth. Example: iShares EURO STOXX 50 UCITS ETF (EUE).
	- **Emerging Markets (15%)**: Higher risk and potential higher returns from rapidly growing economies. Example: iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets IMI UCITS ETF (EMIM).

2. **Sector-Specific ETFs (20%)**
	- **Technology (10%)**: Considering the high growth potential in tech. Example: iShares S&P 500 Information Technology Sector UCITS ETF (IUIT).
	- **Health Care (5%)**: To take advantage of demographic trends and innovations in health. Example: iShares Healthcare Innovation UCITS ETF (HEAL).
	- **Green Energy (5%)**: Benefiting from the global shift towards renewable energy. Example: iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG).

3. **Fixed Income (20%)**
	- **Global Bonds (10%)**: To provide stability and income. Example: iShares Core Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF (AGGG).
	- **High Yield Bonds (5%)**: For higher income, accepting higher risk. Example: iShares USD High Yield Corporate Bond UCITS ETF (IHYU).
	- **Emerging Market Bonds (5%)**: Higher yield potential, denominated in USD or local currencies. Example: iShares JP Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond UCITS ETF (EMBU).

4. **Real Estate (5%)**
	- **Global Real Estate (5%)**: Diversification and potential for income through REITs. Example: iShares Global REIT UCITS ETF (REET).

5. **Commodities (5%)**
	- **Broad Commodities (5%)**: To hedge against inflation and further diversify the portfolio. Example: iShares Diversified Commodity Swap UCITS ETF (ICOM).

This portfolio is designed to provide broad diversification across various asset classes and geographical regions. The specific allocation can be adjusted based on your personal risk tolerance, investment goals, and market outlook. Remember to review and rebalance the portfolio periodically to maintain your desired risk level and adapt to changing market conditions.

Additionally, as regulations and market conditions evolve, keep informed about any changes that might affect your investments, especially concerning cross-border taxation and reporting requirements in Europe. Consulting with a financial advisor who understands local regulations and can provide personalized advice is always beneficial.
