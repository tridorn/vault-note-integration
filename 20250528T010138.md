**Correction:**  
Instead of _"Please refine the organisational design even more (+ I want a triumvirate instead of singular figure)"_, state:  
**"Reconstruct the apex entity's internal governance to replace the singular Primarch with a triumvirate, and re-architect the organisational hierarchy to deepen structural clarity, eliminate single points of failure, and increase ideological, financial, and operational resilience."**

* * *

### **I. The Triumvirate Crown -- _Triarchia Eupatoria_**

You seek a Vatican-Roman hybrid with no singular head. This demands distributed sovereignty at the top, without diluting command. The Triumvirate should be _equal in dignity, asymmetric in portfolio_, and embedded within a tightly controlled apparatus that prevents stasis or internal schism.

**Composition of the Triarchia:**

| Title | Mandate | Strategic Domain | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Archon Strategos** | Oversees financial capital, capital deployment, statecraft. Chair of _Aerarium_and _Legatio_. | Treasury, Diplomacy, External Ventures | 
| **Archon Doctrinus** | Maintains ideological integrity, education, cultural operations. Chair of _Cultura_ and _Institutiones_. | Ideology, Talent, Propagation | 
| **Archon Operarius** | Leads internal operations, infrastructure, security, and implementation. Chair of _Infrastructura_ and _Frontiera_. | Execution, Technology, Security | 

**Operating Protocols:**

- All three must jointly sign for charter amendments or irreversible asset sales.
- Two-of-three majority governs standard decision-making.
- In the event of deadlock, the Custodial College holds tie-breaking vote.
- No Triarch can unilaterally appoint or dismiss prefects or Curial officers.
* * *

### **II. Apex Institutional Organs (Refined)**

| Body | Composition | Mandate | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Triarchia Eupatoria** | 3 Archons, lifetime appointments or renewable 20-year terms. | Apex governance, strategic arbitration, doctrinal and capital alignment. | 
| **Custodial College** | 12 lifetime members; supermajority required for ideological amendments. Elects Triarchs. | Protect charter integrity, validate doctrinal continuity, override executive impasse. | 
| **Curia Eupatoria** | 7 Dicasteries each chaired by a _Praefectus Curiae_with 7-year terms. | Administer core domains; execute long-range policy. | 
| **Senatus Capitalium** | 60 voting capital partners. Can initiate no-confidence motions against Curial prefects. | Strategic accountability from the capital class. | 
| **Tribunatus Interiore** | Internal audit, risk, and inquisition unit. Immune from executive interference. | Conduct investigations, freeze assets, expel compromised actors. Reports only to Custodians. | 
| **Conventus Communitatis** | Consultative body of scholars, citizens, and external fellows. | Non-binding resolutions; cultural legitimacy layer. | 

This eliminates executive over-centralisation while creating a layered firewall structure (Triarchs --> Curia --> Tribunate --> Custodians).

* * *

### **III. Doctrine and Asset Framework (Immutable Design)**

**Charter Codex: _Corpus Eupatoris_ (CE)**

- **Book I: _Lex Fundamentalis_ -- Immutable dogma + telos**
- **Book II: _Ordo Institutionalis_ -- Governance structure + electoral protocols**
- **Book III: _Corpus Patrimonii_ -- Asset lock, capital doctrine, fiscal code**
- **Book IV: _Ordo Liturgicus_ -- Rituals, calendar, ideological propagation instruments**

Asset custody lies exclusively with the apex entity (_Corpus Custodum Eupatoris_), which owns:

- All core patents, brands, strategic real estate.
- Controlling equity (>51%) in flagship ventures.
- Internal currency system for inter-vector transactions (if used).
* * *

### **IV. Curia Eupatoria -- Recalibrated Dicastery Matrix**

| Dicastery | Triarchial Liaison | Domain | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Capitali** | Strategos | Investment, IOE bank, capital deployment, insurance functions. | 
| **Cultura** | Doctrinus | Content, publishing, education, rituals, soft power. | 
| **Institutiones** | Doctrinus | Think tanks, research labs, training academies. | 
| **Infrastructura** | Operarius | Energy, logistics, construction, procurement. | 
| **Frontiera** | Operarius | Space, biotech, AGI, frontier ventures. | 
| **Legatio** | Strategos | Diplomacy, SEZ negotiation, legal arbitration, extraterritoriality. | 
| **Aerarium** | Joint Chair | Treasury, internal audit, ledger integrity, fiscal modelling. | 

Each Dicastery is staffed with a _Praefectus Curiae_ (equivalent of Vatican dicastery heads), subordinate only to the Triarchia.

* * *

### **V. Intelligence and Security Protocol**

**Command Chain:**

- Cohors Praetoria answers to _Archon Operarius_.
- _Director Ordinum_ (civilian counter-intelligence chief) answers only to Custodial College and cannot be removed by any Triarch.

**Protocol:**

- Internal red-team drills every 90 days.
- External disinformation scanning + dark network asset tracking.
- Hardline protocol: if all Triarchs incapacitated, _Tribunatus Interiore_ seizes operational control until Custodial election.
* * *

### **VI. Decision Ladders and Control Redundancy**

**Two-out-of-Three Triarch vote triggers:**

- Capital redeployment > €100m
- Appointment of new Praefectus Curiae
- Initiation of new vector (new arm of Eupator)

**Unanimous Triarch vote triggers:**

- Sale of key IP
- Doctrine amendment proposal
- Dissolution of any dicastery

**Custodial College override (⅔ vote):**

- Invalidate any Triarch decision if it contradicts _Lex Fundamentalis_
- Remove a Triarch in case of verified betrayal of mandate
* * *

### **VII. Spatial Layout of Headquarters**

**Apex Complex: _Civitas Magna Eupatoria_**

- **Triclinium Imperii**: physical chamber of the Triarchia (three stone thrones)
- **Forum Custodum**: Custodial meeting amphitheatre
- **Curia Centralis**: High-administrative wing for all Dicasteries
- **Archivum Codicum**: Vaulted archive for _Corpus Eupatoris_
- **Ager Internus**: Internal operations hub (logistics, surveillance, power)

Includes underground data centre, micro-grid energy supply, biometric sealed doors for Triarch-only access zones.

* * *

### **VIII. Succession Logic (Triarchia Continuity Protocol)**

| Vacancy Trigger | Process | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Triarch dies or resigns | Custodial College initiates 40-day conclave; ⅔ majority required for appointment | 
| Triarch incapacitated | Temporary "Censor" from Custodians appointed with vote power only on deadlocks | 
| All three incapacitated | Tribunatus Interiore activates Protocol Heraclitus: temporary full control with Custodians assuming charter enforcement role | 

Term limits optional, but once seated, Triarchs are essentially quasi-sacral figures.

* * *

### **IX. External Integration (Networked Sovereignty)**

- Triarchs jointly negotiate _Accords of Recognitio_ with SEZs and microstates to create extraterritorial recognition.
- Annual _Convocatio Diplomatica_ brings all client-entities, investors, and allies to Civitatis HQ.
- Issue internal passports for senior operatives and _Consortium Signum_ certification for affiliates.
* * *

### Final Outcome

You now have a structurally resilient, triarchically governed, ideologically hardened, and financially centralised apex institution that:

- Cannot be captured from within.
- Cannot be separated from its subsidiaries without self-destruction.
- Commands symbols, capital, and legitimacy from a singular institutional core.

Next logical step: Would you like a _constitution-grade draft_ for _Lex Eupatoria_ (Book I and II) or a _jurisdictional setup blueprint_ to map optimal hosting locations for each pillar of the system?
