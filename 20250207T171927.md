# **ðŸ“Š How to Account for Commissions and Other Trading Costs:**

#### **1. Understand Futures Commissions Breakdown**
- Futures trading typically involves the following costs:
  - **Broker commissions:** Charged per contract, often between $0.25 and $2.50 per side (buy and sell). For example, Interactive Brokers charges around **$0.85 per side per contract** for most index futures.
  - **Exchange and clearing fees:** Vary by asset and exchange but often total around **$1-$2 per contract**.
  - **Slippage:** The difference between expected and actual execution prices due to market volatility.

### **2. Manual Adjustment for Commissions During Paper Trading**
To simulate the effect of commissions in a paper account:

1. **Estimate your brokerâ€™s all-in commission:**  
   - Combine **broker fees + exchange fees + clearing fees**.  
   - Example for E-mini S&P 500 (ES) at Interactive Brokers:  
     - Broker fee: $0.85 per side  
     - Exchange/clearing fee: ~$1.25 per side  
     - **Total: ~$2.10 per round trip (one buy and one sell per contract)**  

2. **Apply this cost to each trade:**
   - After each simulated trade, subtract the **total round-trip commission** from your calculated profit/loss.
   - **Example:**  
     - You buy 1 contract at 4300 and sell it at 4305, gaining 5 points.  
     - Each point = $50, so gross profit = 5 Ã— $50 = $250.  
     - Subtract commission: $250 - $2.10 = **$247.90** net profit.

3. **Set Up a Simple Spreadsheet:**
   - Create a column to track commissions for each trade, using a formula like:  
     \[
     \text{Net P/L} = \text{Gross P/L} - (\text{Number of Contracts} \times \text{Round-Trip Commission})
     \]  
     Example Format:

     | Trade # | Contracts | Gross P/L | Commission ($) | Net P/L  |
     |---------|-----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
     | 1       | 2         | $500      | $4.20          | $495.80  |
     | 2       | 1         | $250      | $2.10          | $247.90  |
     | 3       | 3         | $750      | $6.30          | $743.70  |

### **3. Adjust Commission and Slippage in Backtesting Software**
- **Platforms like NinjaTrader** and **TradingView Premium** allow for commission and slippage settings.
  - **Step 1:** In the settings, input your estimated commission per trade based on your broker.
  - **Step 2:** For slippage, you can set an average of **1-2 ticks per trade** (e.g., 0.25 points for ES futures), accounting for potential execution delays.

**Why This Matters:**  
Without slippage adjustment, youâ€™ll overestimate profits, especially in fast-moving markets like during the opening or news releases.

### **4. Include Commissions in Risk-Reward Calculations**
A common mistake is to ignore commissions when determining whether a setup meets a risk/reward threshold. To correct this:

1. **Modify the Risk-Reward Formula:**  
   Adjust your expected reward (profit target) to account for commission costs.  
   **Adjusted reward per trade = Gross reward - commission cost**

   Example:  
   - Risk: $100 (stop-loss)  
   - Gross reward: $200 (2:1 risk/reward)  
   - Commission per trade: $2.10  
   - **Adjusted reward:** $200 - $2.10 = $197.90  
   - **Effective risk/reward ratio:** 1.98:1 instead of 2:1

2. **Set a Minimum Threshold:**  
   If your effective risk/reward drops below 1.5:1 after commission adjustments, reconsider the trade.

### **5. Adjust Daily Profit Targets for Commissions**
Many traders set **daily goals without factoring in trading costs**. For realistic results:
- If you aim for **$200 in profit per day** trading 2 contracts, assume ~$4 in commissions per round trip.  
- If you take 5 trades per day, thatâ€™s ~$20 in commissions.  
  - Adjust your profit target: $200 + $20 = **$220 gross profit target.**

---

### **6. Automated Commission Tracking (For Real Trading)**
- Interactive Brokers and other brokers provide **automated reports** tracking real commissions.
- When transitioning from paper to live trading, reconcile your **simulated results with real performance** by checking:
  - Actual commissions vs. your estimated values during simulation.
  - Impact of real slippage (often more significant than commissions).

### **Final Tips for Handling Commissions**
| **Aspect**                  | **Approach**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **During Paper Trading**    | Manually subtract commissions in a journal or spreadsheet.                  |
| **In Backtesting**          | Use platforms that allow built-in commission/slippage settings (e.g., NinjaTrader). |
| **Risk Management**         | Always account for commissions in your risk/reward ratio and daily targets. |
| **Slippage Assumption**     | Assume 1-2 ticks of slippage per trade when trading volatile instruments.   |
| **Profit Target Adjustment**| Increase profit targets to absorb cumulative commission and slippage costs. |
