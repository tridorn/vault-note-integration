Could be an idea to write the summaries of the current timeframe not in the current one but in the one higher. So, the resume of the day for example in the week week timeframe document.

In general, the higher timeframes should be filled on the go with the content of the lower ones and not only on CRAPM

So timeframes generally only have summaries of the lower ones. A jnique case might be day which also could keep the whole half-hour timeframe documents as they don't have their own single documents
