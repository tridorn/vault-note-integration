What I'm about to pass you is a concatenated list of notes on one specific topic. These notes were text copied from conversations with you originally, and then summarised, with a reduction in size of about 1/4. Mind that these notes are densely packed with content, every word is of more importance, as much of the rhetoric clutter surrounding it was cut.

Some note sections that are in immediate or near-succession are very similar. That's because those represent regenerations of the same input. Converge and rationally optimise.

Some other sections are marked as important (with a start and an end), these sections are considered more important

Be aware that a lot of sections mention very similar, or even contradictory concepts. This is due to the fact that they may stem from different conversations, with possibly entirely different contexts, angles, solutions, etc. Your role is to filter the noise and rationally align one coherent system.

The note sections are ordered chronologically. Later sections might thus present more developed or up-to-date information. Factor in that later sections might thus be more "correct" than earlier ones
