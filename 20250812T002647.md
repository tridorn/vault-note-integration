Great question—and it’s more nuanced than just “yes” or “no.”

✳️ Short Answer:

Yes, you should tuck your shirts—in professional or polished settings, and when wearing tailored trousers, jackets, or suits.
But there are smart exceptions.

🧭 Use This Simple Shirt-Tucking Rule:

Outfit Type	Shirt Type	Tuck?	Why
Full suit	Dress shirt	✅ Yes	Always. Untucked ruins the lines and formality.
Blazer + trousers	Dress shirt or polo	✅ Yes	You’re still signaling structure.
Smart casual (no jacket)	Oxford, polo, knit, linen	✅ Usually	Tuck if the hem is long or the shirt is stiff/crisp.
Relaxed casual / travel	Short polo, t-shirt, camp collar	❌ No	The untucked look is intentional and balanced here.

🧍‍♂️ Hem Rule: How to Know if It Should Be Tucked

✅ Tuck if:
	•	The back hem covers your whole butt
	•	The front drops well below your fly
	•	It flares or bunches untucked

❌ Untuck if:
	•	It has a flat or only slightly curved hem
	•	It’s a short polo or modern shirt meant to be worn out
	•	It’s soft, textured, and worn with casual trousers

🔧 Tips for Tucking (So You Don’t Look Stiff)
	1.	Military tuck (fold the side seams in before tucking)—reduces billowing
	2.	Try higher-rise trousers—they hold the tuck better and visually elongate your legs
	3.	Use shirt stays or silicone shirt grips (optional but effective if you’re in motion all day)
	4.	Look at the mirror side profile—your tuck should never balloon at the lower back

⸻

🌎 Cultural & Climate Notes
	•	Hot climates: Tucking still looks sharper, but opt for breathable fabrics and a looser fit—tuck lightly, don’t cinch
	•	Creative/tech settings: A tucked-in knit polo or textured shirt can subtly stand out while still feeling relaxed
	•	Europe/Japan: Tucking is expected more often, even in “casual” outfits
	•	US/LatAm: More room for untucked if the shirt is designed for it (short hem)

👔 Summary

Tuck your shirts by default in professional and tailored looks—but know when to break the rule with intentional, relaxed pieces.

If you’re ever unsure:

“If I’m wearing trousers I’d wear to a meeting, I probably tuck the shirt.”
