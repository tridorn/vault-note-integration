Here's how to boot up both **Eupator (the studio)** and the **Startup Factory (the non-profit feeder)** _in tandem_, with zero prior reputation but maximum leverage, within 6--12 months. The key is to fake nothing, own little, but orchestrate everything.
* * *

## I. Foundational Premise

**You own the studio.** You orchestrate the factory.  
They are separate in law, but coordinated in execution.

This lets you control equity upside **(studio)** while gaining legitimacy and funding from public + institutional actors **(factory)**.
* * *

## II. 4-Stage Smart Bootstrap (Simultaneous Ramp-Up)

### **1. Setup & Signaling (0--2 months)**

**Studio:**

- Register **Eupator UG**. 1.000--1.500€ all-in. Do this immediately.
- Define its purpose as "building and investing in technology companies."
- Build a crisp, minimal pitch site (1-pager) explaining the studio model.

**Factory:**

- Create a **"Rhine-Neckar Startup Factory" working group**, informally branded, but not yet a gGmbH.
- Co-sign MoUs (Letters of Intent) with:

    - 1--2 Mannheim professors (e.g. Prof. Woywode at MCEI).

    - Representatives at KIT and TU Darmstadt (via Entrepreneurship Chairs or TTOs).

    - NEXT Mannheim or MAFINEX as municipal partner.
- You promise orchestration; they promise exploration of collaboration.

**Key output:**  
A Memorandum that makes the project "real." No capital. Just mutual intention.  
Use this to secure meetings, funders, space.

* * *

### **2. First Activity Proof (2--4 months)**

**Joint:**

- Run a **flagship deep-tech hackathon or sprint**, ideally under an existing conference (e.g. Q-Summit).
- Position it as a "Startup Studio Simulation" or "Pre-Founder Sprint."
- Target 30 participants: half business, half STEM (KIT, TU Darmstadt).
- Use your network and university newsletters to fill seats.
- Invite 5 external judges from VC, industry, academia.

**Factory:**

- Handles outreach, logistics, legitimacy.
- Costs covered via minor sponsorships and in-kind support.

**Studio:**

- You pre-select 2--3 sprint ideas and test how founder teams form.
- You get first rights on the teams post-sprint.
- You incorporate the first startup from this funnel via Eupator.

**Key output:**  
One incorporated startup, two press pieces, one investor coffee.  
Now you've "done something."

* * *

### **3. Institution & Capital Layer (4--8 months)**

**Factory:**

- Formalise gGmbH. Founders: one academic, one municipal, and Eupator as "private anchor."
- Apply for EXIST Startup Factory grant concept phase (if cycle reopens) or equivalent state funding.
- Lock in 2--3 universities as institutional supporters--not owners.

**Studio:**

- Raise €100--250k micro-fund from angels or family offices.
- Use this for small tickets in the sprint-generated companies (10--25k per team), shared office space, and part-time co-founders-in-residence.
- Use this to show dealflow and build "portfolio 1."

**Key output:**  
Two legal entities (UG + gGmbH), first angel capital, first 2--3 startups.  
You're now a visible local engine.

* * *

### **4. Expansion Platform (8--12 months)**

**Studio:**

- Launch formal **Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EiR)** program for top Mannheim students. Pair them with technical co-founders from Factory pipeline.
- Standardise startup terms: you take 15--25 % equity + contribute ops stack (legal, tech, growth).

**Factory:**

- Hosts EiRs, manages IP discussions with universities.
- Acts as grant recipient for EXIST Gründerstipendium (you don't need to apply as a student alone).

**Key output:**  
Full loop operational: ideas, teams, prototypes, equity captured.  
Now scale vertically (more startups) or horizontally (more universities).

* * *

## III. Why This Tandem Works

- **You avoid chicken-and-egg traps.** You don't wait for legitimacy--you create a shared initiative and step into leadership.
- **You control equity.** The Factory is "clean"--you don't raise money into it, and it does not own companies.
- **You unlock non-dilutive capital.** EXIST, regional grants, university support all flow through the Factory.
- **You create narrative leverage.** From "student with idea" to "operating venture studio + partner of a regional innovation consortium."
* * *

## IV. Tactical Guardrails

- Never mix finances between Eupator and the Factory. Factory is a public-facing shell.
- Keep the Factory's board multi-stakeholder, but retain content control through operational leadership.
- Use every activity (sprint, EiR, event) to produce one tangible artifact: press mention, legal company, investor interest, student opt-in. Momentum compounds.
* * *

## V. Minimum Valid System

You are operational when:

- Eupator UG exists, with one startup created.
- Factory gGmbH is registered or has signed institutional MoUs.
- At least one event and one grant/public partnership are live.
- You have one professor, one investor, one municipality publicly backing the project.

From there, the narrative can be sold to capital, corporates, and state.

This structure lets you _build real things_ while _acting like an institution_--and that's the shortest route from zero to sovereign.
