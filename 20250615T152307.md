Your prompt lacked precise scope: you should have asked, "Detail Section III, the Structural Architecture, of the operating doctrine."

## III. Structural Architecture

### 1. Unit Definitions

| Unit | Core Mandate | Typical Headcount | Autonomy Envelope | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Cell** | Execute a discrete work stream inside one Sprint | 3-5 | Full control over methods; bound by Sprint objectives | 
| **Mission** | Deliver a Mission Order objective within 6-12 weeks | 2-4 Cells | Select backlog, sequence Sprints, manage quality | 
| **Project** | Own contractual scope, budget, and stakeholder alignment | Aggregates multiple Missions | Approve Mission Orders, control funding gate | 
| **Program** | Aggregate Projects that share KPIs and learning agenda | 2-4 Projects | Optimise resources, resolve cross-project risk | 
| **Campaign** | Coordinate Programs toward a strategic milestone | ≥1 Program | Hold capital envelope, steer quarterly pivots | 
| **Portfolio** | All active Campaigns within one strategy domain | Company scale | Balance risk and return, match capital to vision | 

Key distinction: Projects commit money and scope, Missions commit velocity and craft.

### 2. Team Taxonomy

| Category | Constituents | Primary Product | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Execution** | Cells, Missions | Shippable increments | 
| **Coordination** | Field Officers, Program Directors | Decision velocity, risk clearance | 
| **Support** | Support Divisions (IT, HR, Legal, Finance) | Friction-free enablers | 
| **Governance** | Strategic Operations, Strategic Council | Doctrine, capital allocation, north-star metrics | 
| **Intelligence** | Intelligence Hub | Situational awareness artefacts | 

Each category has a unique SLA to the others, preventing overlap.

* * *

### 3. Field Officer Doctrine

- Mandate: unblock, coach, arbitrate.
- Authority: no command over content, full command over cadence integrity.
- Rituals: daily Pulse sync, weekly risk bulletin to SO, fortnightly morale survey.
- Intervention thresholds: resource deadlock >24 h, scope creep ≥15 %, morale index <70 %.
* * *

### 4. Support Divisions Engagement

- **Service Charter**: response time, quality metric, cost allocation model.
- **Escalation Ladder**: Mission Commander → Field Officer → SD Lead → SO Logistics.
- **Resource Budgeting**: annually capped, re-forecast each Program cycle.

This turns functional silos into quantifiable service providers rather than veto gates.

### 5. Command Stack and Veto Logic

| Layer | Decision Surface | Veto Scope | Override Path | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Strategic Council | Vision, capital ceiling | Absolute | Board (if present) | 
| Strategic Operations | Campaign design, doctrine | Council | Council plenary | 
| Campaign Sponsor | Program mix, major reallocations | SO | Council special session | 
| Program Director | Project composition, resource shifts | Sponsor | SO | 
| Mission Commander | Backlog, quality threshold | Program Director | Sponsor | 
| Cell Lead | Technical method | None, within boundaries | Mission Commander | 

No circular vetoes: each decision has exactly one upward override path.

* * *

### 6. Doctrine Lifecycle

1. Authoring: SO Doctrine cell drafts.

2. Review: Council ratification in quarterly portfolio review.

3. Publication: Version control repository, semantic version tags (e.g. v3.2.1).

4. Enforcement: Field Officers audit compliance during Mission health check.

5. Revision trigger: KPI variance >20 %, external shock, or retrospective consensus.

* * *

### 7. Scalability Guardrails

- Span of control: max seven subordinate units per leader.
- Parallel Missions per Program: cap at ten; beyond that, split the Program.
- Portfolio capital exposure: single Campaign ≤25 % of annual budget.

Guardrails enforce structural coherence as headcount grows.

This Structural Architecture establishes a clear lattice of authority, service, and execution, providing the backbone upon which the Temporal Framework operates.
