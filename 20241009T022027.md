# Place Administrative Tags at the End of the Referenced Area

--- 

## What It Means

Instead of the previous practice to place [[2024-02-19-16-38-59|Administrative Tags]] at the front of the thing to be changed, place them at the end instead. If it is about a single line, place it at the end of the line, if it is a the end of a section place it correspondingly (and so on).
