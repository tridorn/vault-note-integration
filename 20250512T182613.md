Excellent. What you're asking for is the **consulting operating map**--a _top-down taxonomy_ of all the distinct _functions_ a consultant must perform, and the **mental engines** required to execute them with precision. No noise, no overlap, no blur.

Below is a logically **disjoint, collectively exhaustive** map of the consultant's craft: broken into **six core domains**, each with its own internal subfunctions and required toolsets.
* * *

## **Consultant Operating System -- The 6 Capability Pillars**

Each pillar is a _distinct mode of thinking_, not just a task. If you master these six, you can survive and dominate in any consulting environment.

* * *

### **I. Problem Structuring**

> _What is the problem, really?_

**Subfunctions:**

- Frame the core question (what's being solved)
- Disaggregate into sub-issues (MECE trees)
- Identify critical unknowns (prioritization)
- Formulate testable hypotheses

**How to handle:**

- Use Issue Trees (top-down dissection)
- Apply SCQA (Situation--Complication--Question--Answer)
- Prioritize with 2x2 (Impact x Ease) maps

**Mental model:** _Surgical reduction of ambiguity_
* * *

### **II. Analytical Modeling**

> _What drives what?_

**Subfunctions:**

- Identify key value or cost drivers
- Build quantitative models (driver-based logic)
- Stress-test assumptions (scenario analysis)
- Validate with benchmarks or analogs

**How to handle:**

- Build modular Excel models (Inputs → Drivers → Outputs)
- Use sensitivity analysis to identify leverage points
- Incorporate industry ratios/KPIs (ROIC, CAC, etc.)

**Mental model:** _Causal clarity under constraint_
* * *

### **III. Research & Validation**

> _What's real? What's noise?_

**Subfunctions:**

- Targeted data extraction (proof or kill)
- Market mapping (size, growth, players)
- Competitor moves, regulatory shifts
- Internal data diagnostics

**How to handle:**

- Hypothesis-driven research plans (no fishing)
- Use layered sources: reports, calls, databases, proxies
- Synthesize into insight, not summary

**Mental model:** _Judgment under information asymmetry_
* * *

### **IV. Synthesis & Framing**

> _What does this all mean?_

**Subfunctions:**

- Distill complex analysis into key takeaways
- Construct logical narratives (storylines)
- Prioritize what matters vs. what's noise
- Surface implications and recommendations

**How to handle:**

- Use Pyramid Principle (Conclusion → Supporting logic)
- Build storyboard before slides
- Use "So what?" test on every insight

**Mental model:** _Executive filtering of reality_
* * *

### **V. Communication & Packaging**

> _How do I make it land?_

**Subfunctions:**

- Build slide decks (insight > design)
- Title as argument, chart as proof
- Present with control, clarity, confidence
- Prepare for objections

**How to handle:**

- Write titles as conclusions, not labels
- Use 1 idea per slide, no clutter
- Have backup slides per critical logic jump

**Mental model:** _Narrative authority_
* * *

### **VI. Client Navigation**

> _How do I operate politically and relationally?_

**Subfunctions:**

- Understand stakeholder incentives
- Manage communication cadence
- Align output to decision-maker psychology
- Create perception of value and control

**How to handle:**

- Map stakeholder power/influence grid
- Send drafts early; backbrief often
- Use their language (mirror mental models)
- Never surprise the client

**Mental model:** _Tactical empathy + agenda awareness_

## Summary Table

| Pillar | Question It Answers | Core Tools & Methods | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Problem Structuring | What exactly are we solving? | Issue Trees, SCQA, Hypotheses | 
| Analytical Modeling | What are the mechanics? | Excel models, sensitivities, drivers | 
| Research & Validation | What's true and why? | Source ladder, benchmarks, expert calls | 
| Synthesis & Framing | What matters from the mess? | Pyramid logic, storyboards, slide skeletons | 
| Communication | How do I convey powerfully? | Slide rules, talk tracks, visual logic | 
| Client Navigation | How do I move in the room? | Stakeholder maps, political alignment |

This is your map. Every task you get can be dropped into one or more of these buckets. Every weakness you feel is a gap in one of these engines.
