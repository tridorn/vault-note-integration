These features would be strategically placed to create focal points, as well as to reflect the mansion’s lights and architecture at night.  
	- **Paved Walkways:** Symmetrical walkways, laid out in a combination of polished stone and patterned brick, guide visitors through the gardens, linking the house with outdoor relaxation spaces.

**2. Revenue Potential through Exclusive Events**  
	- **Private Gallery Showings and Cultural Events:** Select areas of the estate, like the Decorative Arts Gallery or ballroom, could be opened for exclusive, private events. Partnerships with Cambridge’s art and academic communities could also create an occasional exhibition space for modernist and Art Deco artists.
