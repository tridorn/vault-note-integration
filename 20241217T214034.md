Time planning has three stages for day timeframe

1. unplanned which allows for free task-setting after regular procedure, 
2. checklist which nails down that the checklist has to be followed, independently of how long it takes and 
3. time blocking with attached checklist which also nails down what has to be done to a checklist but constricts the time available for it

- Half hour timeframe document also is a checklist. Time planning means adifferent predefined checklist is inserted
- Time planning creates dynamic time blocks during the day that have a checklist or are based on one. The default timeframe is the half hour one but for example a time block sports (1hour) doesn't has two half hour timeframes but creates a single hour timeframe which has a single checklist. An event in the evening for example that goes on for 3 hours also only one block, one checklist. This is specifically reserved for *time blocking* which should be done as sparse as possible
