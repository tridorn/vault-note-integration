Your query should have been: _"Assess the usability delta between the proposed Git + object-storage spine and consumer-grade suites like Google Workspace, and state whether non-technical staff will be impeded."_
* * *

## 1 路 Reality Check: the Friction Gap

| Criterion | Git + Object Storage | Google Workspace | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Cognitive entry cost** | CLI / commit semantics unfamiliar to business generalists | Drag-and-drop, WYSIWYG | 
| **Version clarity** | Explicit, immutable, diff-able | Opaque "Version History" | 
| **Access control** | Role-based IAM; no ad-hoc sharing | Link sharing, email ACLs | 
| **Automation reach** | Unlimited (APIs, webhooks, CI) | Limited, brittle AppsScript | 
| **Governance integrity** | Provable lineage; signed commits | Retro-editable, weaker audit | 
| **On-ramp time** | ~5 h guided training | Near-zero | 

Friction exists, but it buys immutability, traceability, and automation--all prerequisites for disciplined scale.

## 2 路 Why Non-Tech Staff _Can_ Thrive

1. **Browser Front-Ends Exist** -- GitHub/GitLab offer drag-and-drop uploads, visual diff, and "Edit in browser." S3-compatible stores ship with simple consoles; MinIO's UI is no harder than Drive.

2. **Role-Focused Interfaces** -- Field Officers can expose a _Retool_-built "Upload asset" form that writes to object storage via API; users never see buckets or keys.

3. **Single Sign-On** -- IAM is bound to the same IdP that logs them into Slack and email; no extra passwords.

4. **Tight Coupling with Chat** -- Slash-commands like `/upload` or GitHub's "share via link" surface files inside Slack threads; behaviour mirrors Google Drive previews.

5. **Progressive Enablement** -- Only Mission Commanders need Git branching; HR can live entirely in Retool sheets that auto-commit CSVs behind the curtain.

## 3 路 Mitigation Pattern

| Pain Point | Counter-measure | Time to Deploy | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| "I don't grok Git." | 90-min workshop + cheat-sheet, limited to add / commit | Week 1 | 
| Upload confusion | Web drop-zone mapped to bucket; auto-tags path | Week 2 | 
| Version anxiety | Visual diff plug-in (e.g., GitHub "rich diff" for Office/PDF) | Week 2 | 
| Link sharing | Slack bot generates signed URL on `/share <file>` | Week 3 | 

Net: three weeks of enablement beats years of audit pain.

## 4 路 Strategic Trade-Off

- **Workspace-style UX** is optimised for _ad-hoc collaboration_; it decays under formal governance.
- **Git + object storage** imposes a _learning surcharge_ once, then scales indefinitely with scriptable certainty.

For a venture engine that intends to multiply Missions, Programs, and geographies, **certainty beats convenience**. Pay the one-off training tax; embed a thin UX veneer; reap structural dividends forever.
