# Virtue is internal and external

 Your question could be more sharply posed as: *"Is virtuous action within Stoicism solely dependent on interaction with externals, or can virtue be cultivated in the absence of such external engagements?"*

In Stoic philosophy, virtue does not inherently require interaction with externals, though it often manifests in how we handle and respond to external circumstances. The essence of Stoicism is the cultivation of *virtue*—chiefly through wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance—which is, fundamentally, an internal process of aligning one’s rational will with nature and reason. This process is autonomous, meaning that virtue, at its core, is entirely independent of external conditions. 

The Stoics believed that virtue resides in the proper use of our *prohairesis*—our ability to choose or refuse based on reason. The external world, including wealth, health, reputation, and even relationships, is indifferent in itself; it neither diminishes nor enhances one's capacity for virtue. Thus, Stoicism posits that virtue is entirely within, and is not contingent upon external interaction. One could cultivate temperance, for example, even in solitude, or exercise wisdom in contemplation without the need for external stimuli.

However, the practical application of virtue often requires interaction with the external world. Take *justice* as an example: justice, by nature, involves others—it requires fairness, moral treatment, and actions that contribute to the common good. Similarly, *courage* typically involves confronting external challenges. In this way, external interactions serve as the "arena" in which virtue is expressed, but they are not the origin of virtue.

The Stoic sage, even in isolation, could still be virtuous, as virtue is a state of character, not merely action. But it is also in the face of external events—both trivial and monumental—that this inner virtue is tested, revealed, and strengthened. For example, the Stoic *ataraxia* (serenity) is best demonstrated when external events challenge it, but its cultivation begins within, irrespective of the external world.

In summary, Stoicism holds that virtue is an internal faculty—it is an excellence of character and reason. Interaction with externals is not required for the essence of virtue, but it often provides the context in which virtue is put into practice. You might think of externals as the "canvas" upon which your virtuous character paints, but the ability to paint is fully developed within, without dependence on the external world.
