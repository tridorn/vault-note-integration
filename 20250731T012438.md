You should have stated: _"Devise a rational, security-conscious, and operationally efficient Firefox container architecture from first principles, disregarding defaults."_

### Strategic Context

**Objective:**  
Minimise cross-site tracking, isolate risk domains, streamline cognitive load during browsing, and enable operational compartmentalisation.

**Threat Vectors:**

- Surveillance capitalism (tracking across domains)
- Session persistence (cross-context authentication)
- Targeted phishing or privilege escalation via cookies/session bleed
- Cognitive fragmentation from ambiguous boundaries

**Design Constraints:**

- Human memory and attention are limited; taxonomy must be **self-evident**.
- Over-fragmentation leads to container sprawl and entropy.
- Some interactions necessitate cross-domain workflows (e.g., email â†’ banking)

### Core Principles of Containerisation

1. **Security Domains, Not Activity Labels:**  
Classify by _trust level and threat surface_, not by surface semantics like "shopping" or "social."

2. **Non-Overlap:**  
One website = one container, unless the risk and utility of merging contexts has been explicitly assessed.

3. **Workflow Isolation:**  
Treat each container as a _session boundary_, both cognitively and technically.

### Rational Container Taxonomy

1. **AUTH-HIGH (Privileged Authentication):**

    - Banking, government portals, 2FA dashboards, investment accounts

    - No email, no search, no feeds

    - Isolated from all comms and general web activity

2. **AUTH-MED (Work/Professional Auth):**

    - Corporate portals, GitHub, Notion, productivity suites

    - Everything authenticated but not high-value targets

    - Cookie lifespan policies strict, no shopping or social integration

3. **AUTH-LOW (Casual Personal Auth):**

    - Reddit, forums, ecommerce logins, etc.

    - Persistent cookies allowed, but container segregates low-trust logins

4. **COMMS (Cross-channel Communication):**

    - Email, chat (ProtonMail, Gmail, Discord, etc.)

    - Treated as ingress vectors and must be separated from high-auth containers

    - Absolutely no browsing from within

5. **SEARCH/RESEARCH:**

    - Wikipedia, news, academia, general browsing

    - Non-authenticated, ephemeral, suitable for volatile exploration

    - Delete cookies on container close

6. **SURVEILLANCE-SINK (Social/Trackers):**

    - Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube

    - Accept that these will be tracking vectors; tightly segregated

    - Used only when strictly necessary

7. **NUKE (Disposable):**

    - Open-ended unknown links, one-offs, trials

    - Delete container or history after session

    - Serves as a damage sink

8. **NON-CONTAINER (Strategic Use Only):**

    - Disabled by default

    - Only used for services that _require_ non-container use (some auth flows may fail in containers)

    - Treat as a red zone
* * *

### Implementation Guidance

- **Naming Convention:** Prefix containers by trust level (`AUTH-`, `COMMS-`, etc.) for clarity
- **Color Coding:** Not aesthetic; use to signal cognitive risk level (e.g., red = NUKE, green = AUTH-HIGH)
- **Extensions:** Disable or tightly restrict in all but SEARCH or NUKE
- **Default Container Behaviour:** Enforce container prompt on new tabs to eliminate leakage
- **Session Discipline:** Never mix workflows in a container. Each session should begin with intent: "What am I about to do and in which domain does it belong?"
* * *

### Implications

This architecture sharply delineates session risk profiles. It will introduce some friction but significantly constrains attack surface and cognitive ambiguity. The number of containers is minimal but strategically exhaustive. Adaptation will require about 2--3 days of muscle memory tuning. After that, the clarity becomes operationally freeing.
