# Invest in Yourself

1. Buy back your time. Identify areas that leak your creative energy (house keeping, returning things, literally any "life thing" or other things that is of annoyance for you)
2. Buy yourself into the proximity of people you want to be around (conferences, location, membership etcetera)
3. leave money on the table. Take pay cuts for better opportunities (bad clients, be around better people)
