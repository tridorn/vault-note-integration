To tailor your learning recommendations around the structure you're aiming to set up for your website, here’s a step-by-step approach that focuses on the core aspects you want to build from the start:

### 1. **Headless CMS (GraphQL-based CMS)**

	Since you're planning to use a headless CMS from the start, focus on learning:
	
	- **GraphQL Basics**: Understand how GraphQL differs from REST APIs, how queries and mutations work, and how to fetch specific data.
	- **Headless CMS Setup**: Choose between WPGraphQL, Strapi, or Sanity, and go through the documentation to set up one of these systems to serve content to your Nuxt.js front-end.
	
	**Learning Recommendations**:
	- [GraphQL for Beginners](https://www.howtographql.com/)
	- [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/getting-started/)
	- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/documentation)
	- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/docs)

### 2. **Nuxt.js For Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG)**

	As you’re going with Nuxt.js for SSR/SSG, it's crucial to:
	
	- **Nuxt.js Basics**: Learn Nuxt’s architecture, SSR, and SSG capabilities.
	- **Nuxt.js with GraphQL**: Dive into how to use GraphQL in Nuxt to fetch CMS data dynamically and render it on the server.
	- **Routing**: Learn about Nuxt's file-based routing system, which automatically creates routes based on your directory structure.
	
	**Learning Recommendations**:
	- [Nuxt.js Docs](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/get-started) (particularly the "Server-Side Rendering" and "Static Site Generation" sections)
	- [Nuxt.js and GraphQL](https://typescript.nuxtjs.org/cookbook/graphql/)

### 3. **TypeScript Integration**

	Since you’ll be using TypeScript, it's essential to familiarize yourself with:
	
	- **TypeScript Basics**: Understand how to define types, interfaces, and classes.
	- **Using TypeScript with Nuxt**: Learn how to configure Nuxt.js for TypeScript and manage types across components and data-fetching functions.
	
	**Learning Recommendations**:
	- [TypeScript for Beginners](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
	- [Nuxt.js TypeScript Setup](https://typescript.nuxtjs.org/guide/setup/)

### 4. **Pinia For State Management**

	Since you’re starting with Pinia, focus on:
	
	- **Pinia Basics**: Learn how Pinia is used for state management, replacing Vuex. Understand how to set up global state, actions, and getters.
	- **Pinia with TypeScript**: Learn how to integrate TypeScript with Pinia for strongly typed state management.
	
	**Learning Recommendations**:
	- [Pinia Documentation](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
	- [State Management in Nuxt.js with Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/ssr/nuxt.html)

### 5. **SEO And Performance**

	Optimizing for SEO and performance from the start is crucial. You’ll need to learn:
	
	- **Nuxt.js Meta Tags**: How to manage meta tags for SEO, including dynamic metadata based on the page content.
	- **Lazy Loading & Image Optimization**: Learn how to lazy load components and images to improve performance.
	- **Nuxt.js SSR Optimization**: Learn how to optimize SSR to ensure faster rendering and performance.
	
	**Learning Recommendations**:
	- [Nuxt.js SEO Guide](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/features/meta-tags-seo/)
	- [Lazy Loading in Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/making-slow-pages-faster)

### 6. **Tailwind CSS and Design System**

	Since you plan to use Tailwind CSS and potentially build a design system, start with:
	
	- **Tailwind Basics**: Learn how to use Tailwind for utility-first styling and creating a responsive design system.
	- **Component Libraries & Storybook**: Consider learning Storybook to manage and preview UI components in isolation, ensuring consistency across the site.
	
	**Learning Recommendations**:
	- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
	- [Storybook for Vue](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/get-started/introduction)

### 7. **Scalable Hosting and Deployment**

	As you're planning to use platforms like Vercel or Netlify for deployment:
	
	- **Deployment on Vercel/Netlify**: Learn how to set up a deployment pipeline, integrate Nuxt.js with these platforms, and configure automatic builds.
	- **Serverless Functions**: If you plan to use serverless functions, explore how to set them up for form submissions or small APIs.
	
	**Learning Recommendations**:
	- [Deploying Nuxt.js on Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nuxt-with-vercel)
	- [Netlify for Nuxt.js](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/11/30/how-to-deploy-nuxt.js-sites-to-netlify/)

### 8. **GraphQL For Data Fetching**

	You’ve mentioned GraphQL from the start, so continue deepening your knowledge on:
	
	- **GraphQL in Nuxt**: How to fetch data efficiently, avoid over-fetching, and manage real-time updates if needed.
	
	**Learning Recommendations**:
	- [Apollo and GraphQL with Nuxt.js](https://apollo.nuxtjs.org/)

### Conclusion

Start by focusing on **Nuxt.js fundamentals, TypeScript, Pinia for state management, and GraphQL integration**. Tailwind CSS can be learned simultaneously for styling, while scalable deployment strategies and SEO optimization can be layered on once your basic structure is working.
