# CRAPM Logging Form Design

Creating a system that's platform-independent and adaptable for mental processing, while also capturing data for historical analysis, is a great strategy for enhancing productivity and self-awareness over time. Using a tool like Google Forms to quickly log data through multiple-choice questions or brief inputs can streamline the process significantly. Here's how you can set up your logging system to align with the CRAPM method, using Google Forms for efficient data capture:

## 1. **Designing Your Google Form**

- **Form Sections:** Create separate sections for Categorise, Review, Adjust, Plan, and Mindfulness. This keeps your responses organized according to each step of the CRAPM method.
- **Question Types:** Utilize multiple-choice, checkboxes, and scale questions for quick selections, along with short answer fields for brief, open-ended inputs.
- **Recurring Questions:** Include questions that recur in each session to track consistency, changes, or improvements over time.

## 2. **Categorise Section**

- **Question:** "Did you add all new tasks and information into your system?"
  - **Answers:** Yes / No
- **Question:** "How many new items were categorized?"
  - **Answers:** Number input

## 3. **Review Section**

- **Question:** "Number of tasks completed:"
  - **Answers:** Number input
- **Question:** "Encountered interruptions or distractions?"
  - **Answers:** None / Few / Many
- **Question:** "Did any tasks remain unfinished?"
  - **Answers:** Yes / No
  - If Yes, **follow-up question:** "Reason for unfinished tasks:" with options like Overestimated Time, Interruptions, Lack of Resources, etc.

## 4. **Adjust Section**

- **Question:** "Adjustments made for next segment:"
  - **Answers:** Checklist options (e.g., "Changed work environment", "Re-prioritized tasks", "Scheduled breaks", etc.)

## 5. **Plan Section**

- **Question:** "Tasks planned for next segment:"
  - **Answers:** Short answer for brief listing or key tasks
- **Question:** "Confidence level in plan completion:"
  - **Answers:** Scale of 1-5

## 6. **Mindfulness Section**

- **Question:** "Mindfulness activity performed:"
  - **Answers:** Multiple choice (e.g., "Deep breathing", "Gratitude reflection", "Body scan", etc.)
- **Question:** "Mood after mindfulness practice:"
  - **Answers:** Scale of 1-5 or Emoji scale

## 7. **General Tips for Form Use**

- **Accessibility:** Keep a shortcut to your form easily accessible on your devices or bookmark it in your web browser for quick access.
- **Simplicity:** Keep questions straightforward and answers brief to minimize the time spent logging information.
- **Review:** Regularly review your form responses to identify patterns, improvements, or areas needing attention.

By using Google Forms in this way, you can efficiently capture and analyze your productivity and well-being trends over time without it becoming a time-consuming task. This data can be invaluable for personal growth, identifying what strategies work best for you, and making informed adjustments to your CRAPM routine.
