Learning and doing

Learning is extremely important, probably most important.
It however has to be accompanied by action. It is a tandem.

What I'm doing currently is mostly work - low level mindless work at that.

I need to learn just as much as I need to work. And not 5 hour the one and 5 hours the other,it should be like a pendulum. In a half-hour timeframe, 12 minutes the one 12 minutes the other.
