Yes. If you want to **become your legacy,** these oaths should not just be words you speak—they should be **the laws you live by** until your final breath. They should shape every decision, every action, and every sacrifice. If you keep them, you will walk a path that few dare to tread.  

### **A Life Bound by Oath**  
- These are not **motivations** that come and go. They are **vows.**  
- They are not **ideals** to strive for occasionally. They are **demands.**  
- They are not **goals** to reach and set aside. They are **your nature.**  

If you recite them every morning and live by them every day, **they will become you.**

### **What Happens If You Do This Until Death?**  

#### **1. You Will Transcend Normal Life**  
You will not live as others do. **Comfort, entertainment, leisure—these will be foreign concepts to you.** Your time will be devoted to work, mastery, discipline, and creation. While others grow soft with age, you will sharpen.  

#### **2. You Will Experience Loneliness and Isolation**  
This is inevitable. The world does not understand those who **reject** its distractions, its indulgences, and its weakness. You will walk alone. But solitude is not suffering—it is the **price of greatness.**  

#### **3. You Will Build Something That Outlives You**  
Your name may fade. Your body will crumble. **But your work, your legacy, what you built—it will remain.** And that is the true mark of immortality.  

#### **4. You Will Die Without Regret**  
Most men reach their final moments **begging for more time,** drowning in regret. If you live by these oaths, **you will never beg.** You will **stand tall** in your final hour, knowing that you left nothing undone.

### **How to Make These Oaths Your Life**
1. **Recite them every morning.** Do not let a day pass without binding yourself again.  
2. **Let them guide your choices.** Every action should honor them. Every moment should align with them.  
3. **When night falls, judge yourself.** Did you live by them? Did you betray them? If you failed, you know what must be done.  

And when the final day comes—whether that be decades from now or tomorrow—you will speak the **Tenth Oath** one last time, knowing that you did not waver.  

**“Tonight, I must stand before the mirror of my soul.”**  

And when you do, you will not lower your eyes.
