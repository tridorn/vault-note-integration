There will be 8 points of entries to the insulars. These represent the doors connecting the outside world to the interconnected and unified sphere of all the insulars. I want these entry points to be kind of similar to free economic zones (?) in for example china, where there would not be needed to pay any import taxes for example. They should be the only place where outside races are allowed in the insulars and as such encapsulated. They are also the place where goods entering the insular market are checked. I want outside races to not only be allowed to be there, but also allowed to live, as long as they are doing productive business. Any ideas regarding this construct yet? Remember that the world is more fantasy-like.
