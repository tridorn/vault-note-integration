Here’s a **restructured system** that blends your existing folders with the "gamified protagonist" concept, using precise, neutral names while maintaining a logical flow. Folders are weighted to avoid clutter and align with actionable life domains:

---

### **Root Folder: Life Protagonist System**  
*(Central hub for your gamified life planning)*  

#### **0. 🏠 Dashboard**  
- `Home.md` (Overview with linked progress bars, key metrics, and quick-access links)  
- `Progress Map.md` (Visual timeline of goals, habits, and milestones)  

---

#### **1. 📁 Foundations**  
*(Core identity and principles)*  
- `Personal Values.md` (Guiding principles, ethical framework)  
- `Strengths & Skills.md` (Existing competencies and talent inventory)  
- `Purpose & Vision.md` (Long-term narrative and legacy goals)  
- `Weaknesses & Growth.md` (Areas for improvement, blockers)  

---

#### **2. 📁 Objectives**  
*(Goals framed as "missions" with clear outcomes)*  
- `📁 Annual Missions`  
  - `2024 - Financial Independence.md` (Clear KPIs: savings rate, income streams)  
  - `2024 - Health Transformation.md` (KPIs: body fat %, endurance metrics)  
- `📁 Quarterly Targets`  
  - `Q1 2024 - Save $5k.md` (Linked to daily habits like budgeting)  
  - `Q1 2024 - Learn Python Basics.md` (Linked to study routines)  
- `📁 Completed Objectives` (Archive of achievements)  

---

#### **3. 📁 Practices**  
*(Habits and routines as "training systems")*  
- `📁 Daily Habits`  
  - `Morning Routine.md` (Step-by-step protocol)  
  - `Evening Review.md` (Reflection prompts)  
- `📁 Weekly Routines`  
  - `Fitness Schedule.md` (Workout plans, rest days)  
  - `Learning Blocks.md` (Timeboxed skill sessions)  
- `📁 Skill Development`  
  - `Public Speaking.md` (Progress tracker, resources)  
  - `Nutrition Literacy.md` (Meal plans, research notes)  

---

#### **4. 📁 Tracking**  
*(Quantitative progress and metrics)*  
- `📁 Health Metrics`  
  - `Fitness Log.md` (Workouts, heart rate, recovery)  
  - `Nutrition Tracker.md` (Macros, meal consistency)  
- `📁 Financial Metrics`  
  - `Budget Dashboard.md` (Income/expenses, net worth)  
  - `Investment Portfolio.md` (Asset allocation, returns)  
- `📁 Knowledge Metrics`  
  - `Learning Progress.md` (Courses completed, books read)  

---

#### **5. 📁 Reflection**  
*(Qualitative reviews and insights)*  
- `Daily Journal.md` (Brief log of wins/challenges)  
- `Weekly Review.md` (Alignment check with objectives)  
- `Monthly Retrospective.md` (Habit success rate, course corrections)  

---

#### **6. 📁 Timeframes**  
*(Time-bound planning and journals)*  
- `📁 Long-Term (5+ Years)`  
  - `Legacy Goals.md` (Impact, family, career zenith)  
- `📁 Mid-Term (1-5 Years)`  
  - `Career Path.md` (Promotions, skill milestones)  
- `📁 Short-Term (<1 Year)`  
  - `Event Planning.md` (Trips, projects, deadlines)  

---

#### **7. 📁 Systems**  
*(Frameworks and mental models)*  
- `Task Management.md` (How you prioritize and execute tasks)  
- `Note-Taking Framework.md` (PARA/Zettelkasten/other)  
- `Decision-Making Models.md` (Cost-benefit, premortems)  
- `Mental Models Library.md` (80/20 rule, inversion, etc.)  

---

#### **8. 📁 Progress Systems**  
*(Gamification mechanics with neutral labels)*  
- `Levels & Milestones.md` (Define "levels" for skills/goals)  
- `Rewards Catalog.md` (Non-monetary incentives: e.g., "Unlock a weekend hike after 30 gym sessions")  
- `XP Tracking.md` (Points for habits completed, goals achieved)  
- `Challenges & Badges.md` (Time-bound sprints, e.g., "30-Day No-Spend Challenge")  

---

### **Key Improvements Over Your Current Structure**  
1. **Goal-Action Alignment**: Objectives link directly to habits/routines (e.g., "Save $5k" → daily budgeting habit).  
2. **Neutral Gamification**: "Progress Systems" replaces overt game jargon but keeps mechanics like XP and rewards.  
3. **Balanced Folders**: Each subfolder contains 5–15 files (e.g., "Practices" splits habits/routines/skills).  
4. **Precision**: No "&" in folder names (e.g., "Health Metrics" instead of "Health & Fitness").  

### **Example Workflow**  
- A **Quarterly Target** like *"Learn Python Basics"* in `Objectives` links to:  
  - A **Weekly Routine** in `Practices` (e.g., 3x coding sessions)  
  - **XP Tracking** in `Progress Systems` (e.g., 50 XP/session)  
  - A **Monthly Retrospective** in `Reflection` to adjust difficulty.
