Certainly. Below is a **complete, well-documented explanation** of the proposed YAML front matter metadata structure. It includes **rationale, best practices, and usage strategy** for each block and key -- designed so you (or future-you) can read it like a living contract between your vault and your workflow.
* * *

# ✅ Overview: Purpose of Metadata in Obsidian Notes

YAML front matter serves as a structured, machine-readable layer at the top of each note.  
It enables:

- **Consistent identity tracking** across notes and over time
- **Lifecycle awareness** (where a note is in your information workflow)
- **Classification and tagging** without chaos
- **Relationship modeling** (like Breadcrumbs-style hierarchies, sequences)
- **Automated processing** (for publishing, AI indexing, audits, etc.)
- **Scalability**: You can build systems over your notes, not just search through them

This schema is designed to be **future-proof**, **human-readable**, and **automation-ready**.

# 📌 CORE FIELDS (Required for Every Note)

### `schema`

- **What**: An integer version ID of the metadata schema itself.
- **Why**: Allows you to upgrade/change field meanings later without rewriting all notes.
- **Usage**: Start with `schema: 1`, and only increment if you make _breaking changes_ to the structure.
* * *

### `uid`

- **What**: A globally unique, immutable identifier for the note.
- **Why**: Lets you refer to notes without relying on fragile titles or paths.
- **Format**: Use your `YYYYMMDDHHmmss` timestamp format, or a ULID.
- **Best Practice**: Make the `uid` the **filename** of the note to keep filesystem + metadata synced.
* * *

### `title`

- **What**: Human-readable note title.
- **Why**: Used in previews, exports, backlinks, and search.
- **Rule**: Must mirror the first `# H1` of the note body. Use a linter or script to sync.
- **Style**: Use natural titles, not IDs here -- "Deep Work Retrospective", not "20250720132541".
* * *

### `owner`

- **What**: Author or steward of the note.
- **Why**: For collaboration or clarity about responsibility.
- **Format**: Single string (`hk`) or array (`[hk, ab]`).
* * *

### `created` / `updated`

- **What**: ISO 8601 timestamps (with time zone) for creation and last update.
- **Why**: Enables sorting, automation, versioning.
- **Automation**:

    - `created`: set once at note creation.

    - `updated`: set on every content change (automated on save or commit).
- **Tool**: Use Git hooks or Obsidian plugins to update `updated`.
* * *

### `rev`

- **What**: Monotonic revision number (integer).
- **Why**: Useful for version-aware exports or syncing with external systems.
- **Policy**: Increment manually when a change is _meaningful_ (not just spelling or layout).

# 🔁 `life:` -- Lifecycle Information

Reflects _where the note is in your process_ and _what its current commitment level is_.

| Key | What | Notes | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `stage` | Position in lifecycle | e.g., `capture`, `plan`, `work`, `library`. Should mirror folder location. | 
| `status` | Micro-state | e.g., `idea`, `draft`, `review`, `final`. Optional but clarifying. | 
| `project` | Owning project | If tied to a scoped effort, provide the project ID or slug. | 
| `sprint` | Timebox (optional) | For use in sprints or time-based planning. ISO week format is ideal (`2025-W30`). | 
| `due` | Deadline (optional) | For reminders, audits, or filtering overdue work. | 

* * *

# 🧭 `class:` -- Classification

Describes _what this note is about_ and how to group it thematically or structurally.

| Key | What | Notes | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `topics` | Canonical categories | Must come from a **controlled vocabulary**. Helps avoid tag sprawl. | 
| `tags` | Free-form keywords | Used for filtering, dashboards. Never duplicate what's in `topics`. | 
| `facets` | Structured properties | Key-value pairs (e.g., `type: concept`, `effort_size: small`). Use when discrete, enumerable. | 

* * *

# 🔗 `link:` -- Relationships (Breadcrumbs-style)

Models **structured connections** between notes (hierarchies, sequences, derivations).

| Key | What | Rule | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `broader` | Parent concepts | UIDs only. Max 2 per note. | 
| `related` | Similar but not hierarchical | Think of this as "see also". | 
| `derived_from` | Adapted/evolved from | Useful for case studies, tweaks. | 
| `supersedes` | Replaces prior work | Shows lineage in content evolution. | 

> **Best Practice**: Always refer to `uid`s here -- never file names or titles.
* * *

# 🧾 `desc:` -- Descriptive Metadata

Helps with previews, search, summaries, and filtering.

| Key | What | Rule | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `summary` | Abstract | 1--3 sentence hand-written summary. Required for `stage: library`. | 
| `keywords_auto` | Machine-generated terms | Do not edit by hand. Generated by TF-IDF, KeyBERT, or embeddings. | 
| `words` | Word count | Auto-filled on save. | 
| `lang` | Language code | ISO 639-1 (`en`, `de`, `fr`…); useful for multilingual vaults. | 

* * *

# 🧬 `src:` -- Source & Provenance

Tracks where the note's content came from.

| Key | What | Example | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `origin` | Provenance category | `self`, `web`, `book`, `meeting`, etc. | 
| `refs` | Citation keys | BibTeX keys, DOI, internal source IDs. | 
| `urls` | External links | Canonical source URLs. | 
| `captured_via` | Method of capture | `manual`, `webclip`, `ocr`, `import`. | 

* * *

# 🔒 `sec:` -- Security, Retention, Licensing

Prepares notes for **governance and compliance** as your system matures.

| Key | What | Example | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `sensitivity` | Privacy level | `public`, `internal`, `confidential`, `secret`. | 
| `retention` | Long-term plan | `retain`, `review`, `purge`. | 
| `review_on` | Date for re-evaluation | `2026-07-01` | 
| `license` | Usage license | e.g., `CC-BY-4.0`, `proprietary`, etc. | 

* * *

# 📈 `meta:` -- System-Tracked Metrics

Automatically updated usage metrics for audit, relevance scoring, etc.

| Key | What | Example | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `last_opened` | Timestamp last viewed | Tracked via plugin or script | 
| `open_count` | Times accessed | Use cautiously; approximate | 
| `referenced_by` | Backlink count snapshot | Good for finding orphans | 

* * *

# 🤖 `auto:` -- Automation Flags

Machine-readable booleans or enums for automation pipelines.

| Key | What | Values | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `export` | Include in publish pipeline | `true` / `false` | 
| `ai_embedding` | NLP process status | `queued`, `done`, `skip` | 
| `lock` | Prevent edits | `true` to make read-only or audit-only | 

* * *

# 🧪 `x_<namespace>:` -- Custom Extension Blocks

Reserved for any **future or domain-specific needs** you may invent.

Examples:

- `x_research:` for lab-specific protocols or variables
- `x_finance:` for budget or invoice notes
- `x_journal:` for mood, sentiment, mood-tagging

**Rule:** Never mix your custom keys inside existing blocks. Always namespace!
* * *

# 🔄 How To Apply This Schema

### 1. Template Use

Use skeletons or templates to auto-fill:

- `uid` → based on timestamp
- `title` → from H1
- `created`, `updated` → now
- `stage` → inferred from folder

### 2. Automation Tools

Set up:

- **Linter**: checks schema version, ensures required fields
- **Pre-commit Git Hook**: updates `updated`, `rev`, `words`
- **Nightly script**: rebuilds `keywords_auto`, audits `stage` alignment
- **Weekly task**: flags overdue notes, orphans, etc.

# 📚 Summary: Why This Works

| Feature | Benefit | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Namespaced blocks | Modular growth without breaking existing notes | 
| Small core | Easy to remember and apply | 
| UID + Schema | Long-term referential integrity + upgrade path | 
| Relationship model | Integrates smoothly with Breadcrumbs if adopted | 
| Clean lifecycle semantics | Mirrors your folder structure + workflow | 
| Machine/human split | Humans write the important bits, scripts handle the rest |
