You meant: "I have access to the Lamy 2000 in three variants--rollerball (Tintenroller), ballpoint (Kugelschreiber), and 4-in-1 multipen (Mehrsystemschreiber). Which should I choose, and does the multipen carry all four refills simultaneously?"

* * *

## Clarified Definitions

| German | English | Writing Type | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Tintenroller** | Rollerball | Liquid ink, smooth glide, wetter than ballpoint | 
| **Kugelschreiber** | Ballpoint | Oil-based ink, writes on most surfaces, low smudge | 
| **Mehrsystemschreiber** | Multipen / 4-in-1 | Typically: 3 ballpoint colours + 1 mechanical pencil (0.5 mm) | 
* * *

## Yes: The **Lamy 2000 Mehrsystemschreiber** **holds all four components**simultaneously:
- Black ballpoint
- Blue ballpoint
- Red ballpoint
- Mechanical pencil (0.5 mm)

Switching is gravity-based: rotate the pen so the desired label faces upward, press the top. Retraction is automatic when switching.

## Strategic Assessment

| Model | Pros | Cons | Verdict | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Tintenroller** | Wet, ink-like flow; smoothest writing; more expressive | Bleeds more; not ideal for cheap paper; capped | _Feels closest to a fountain pen, but too redundant beside your Falcon_ | 
| **Kugelschreiber** | Durable, low-maintenance, retractable | Writing feel is stiffer; single color | _Viable EDC option, elegant and simple--but limited function_ | 
| **Mehrsystemschreiber (4-in-1)** | Compact access to red/blue/black ink + pencil; no cap; same aesthetic as other 2000s | Slightly thicker barrel; rotation learning curve | _Maximises function without compromising design; best complement to your Falcon and Rotring_ | 
* * *

## Recommendation

### Choose the **Lamy 2000 Mehrsystemschreiber (4-in-1)**.

It complements your system on every axis:

- **Graphite redundancy**: Matches your Rotring mechanical pencil in function, not form.
- **Color annotation**: Red/blue ink lets you flag, prioritise, or structure marginalia without adding pens.
- **No maintenance**: Unlike fountain pens, you can deploy it instantly, on cheap paper, upside-down, in field conditions.
- **Aesthetic integration**: Same Makrolon + steel design language as the Lamy 2000 fountain pen (if you ever own both), and subtly differentiated from your Falcon.

No other variant offers this breadth in such a clean form factor.

Let me know if you want a refill upgrade map (the Lamy M21s are serviceable but can be replaced with higher-flow or hybrid inks via D1 adapters).
