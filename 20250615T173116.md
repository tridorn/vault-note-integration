### Canonical Working Structures

_Minimal scaffolds that every initiative re-uses. Nothing more, nothing less._

| Code | Name | Purpose | Core Artefacts Contained | Who "owns" it | When It Dies | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **PW** | **Project-Workspace** | Single authoritative container for _scope_ (the "what"). | `MasterContent.md`, `MetricMap.json`, `/InterfaceContracts`, `/DecisionLog.csv`, `/RiskSheet.csv` | **Project Owner** | When the Project closes | 
| **MP** | **Mission-Pack** | Autonomous sandbox for _execution_(the "how"). Lives inside a PW but is version-controlled as its own branch. | `MissionOrder.yaml`, `/SprintBoards`, `/ProcessCards`, `/Output` | **Mission Commander** | Auto-archived at Mission retrospective | 
| **SL** | **Shared-Library** | Cross-project common assets--approved ProcessCards, design tokens, code snippets. Read-only for Missions. | `/ProcessCards`, `/DesignTokens`, `/CodeSnippets` | **Support Divisions** | Evergreen; pruned quarterly | 
| **IF** | **Intel-Feed** | Rolling store of SignalBriefs; no edits, only new drops. | `/PriorityA`, `/PriorityB`, `/PriorityC` | **Intelligence Hub** | Items auto-expire 90 days | 
| **DLG** | **Decision-Ledger** | Organisation-wide append-only mirror of every DecisionLog row; supports audit bots. | `DecisionLog_master.csv` | **SO Doctrine** | Never--immutable history |

### Canonical Work-Streams

_(Every real initiative is just one of these--or a combination.)_

| Stream | Trigger | Primary Unit | Typical Flow | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Build** | New product / feature | PW → MP chain | Scope (PW) ➜ Mission Packs iterate until KPI met ➜ Close PW | 
| **Fix** | Priority risk / defect | Task-Force (TF) | FO opens MP-Fix inside existing PW ➜ 1--2 Sprints ➜ merge back | 
| **Research** | Exploration / intel gap | PW-Lite + MP-Probe | Create minimal PW (MC + MetricMap) ➜ short MP ➜ SignalBriefs feed IH ➜ decide GO / NO-GO | 
| **Scale** | Roll-out / localisation | Parent PW spawns child PWs | Clone PW template per market ➜ parallel Mission Packs ➜ Program Director syncs MetricMaps | 
| **Enable** | New cross-team capability | Shared-Library Pull Request | SD authors ProcessCard → PR into SL ➜ auto-publish; Missions consume read-only | 
* * *

### Independence **without** Fragmentation

| Design Lever | How It Works | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Branch-per-Mission** | MP lives on its own branch inside PW; merge only after retrospective passes. Prevents cross-Mission file collisions. | 
| **Read-only Shared-Library** | Execution units can _consume_ but not mutate shared assets, preserving integrity. | 
| **Typed InterfaceContracts** | Any dependency (e.g., Mission ↔ SD, PW ↔ Program) must have an IC file; bots block work if missing. | 
| **Automated Mirrors** | DecisionLog rows push to central DLG; no local silos of rationale. | 
| **Expiry Hooks** | Intel-Feed auto-purges; Mission Packs auto-archive. System self-cleans. | 
* * *

### Minimal Rules to Keep It Coherent

1. **One PW per Project.**

2. **Mission work only inside an MP branch of a PW.**

3. **No file drifts outside these five components.**

4. **CI bot fails build if MasterContent isn't updated at Sprint close.**

5. **FO closes any Mission that overruns by >25 %--must be re-chartered.**

With **five structural repositories** and **five work-streams** you gain disciplined autonomy: every team knows where to operate, nothing escapes the backbone, yet no unit is shackled by heavyweight bureaucracy.
