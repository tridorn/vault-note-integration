Marrying economic functionality with military defense in an entry point, especially in a fantasy setting, requires a design that integrates commercial facilities with strategic defense mechanisms. Additionally, ensuring local compliance involves a blend of security measures and community engagement. Hereâ€™s how the Crystallines might achieve this balance:

1. **Fortified Yet Accessible Design**: 
   - The entry points should be architecturally formidable, with reinforced walls and magical barriers. However, they should also have well-designed trade routes and access points to facilitate commerce.
   - Incorporate hidden defensive structures within the commercial architecture. For example, marketplaces could have enchantments or mechanisms that can quickly transform them into defensive positions.

2. **Controlled Access Points**: 
   - Have controlled, secure access points for trade and entry. These points can be heavily guarded and magically protected to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Use magical identification systems to screen entrants, distinguishing between traders, visitors, and potential threats.

3. **Integrated Defense Systems**: 
   - Implement advanced magical and conventional defense systems, such as enchanted turrets, golems or guardians for protection, and magical shields to deflect attacks.
   - Have contingency plans for quick mobilization of defenses, such as summoning protective barriers or activating defensive spells in times of attack.

4. **Economic Incentives for Security**: 
   - Offer economic incentives for traders and local businesses to comply with security protocols. This could include reduced trade tariffs for those who consistently adhere to safety standards or provide intelligence on potential threats.
   - Establish a merchant guard or militia, comprising local traders or mercenaries, incentivized to protect the entry point.

5. **Surveillance and Intelligence**: 
   - Utilize magical and conventional means for surveillance, such as scrying mirrors, crystal balls, or watchtowers, to monitor for potential threats.
   - Maintain a network of informants and a system for gathering and analyzing intelligence.

6. **Local Community Engagement**: 
   - Engage with the local community and traders to ensure compliance and support. This can be achieved through town hall meetings, community benefits, and involving local leaders in decision-making.
   - Offer training and education on the importance of security measures and how they benefit the community economically.

7. **Rapid Response Forces**: 
   - Train and maintain a rapid response force capable of dealing with various threats. This force should be well-equipped with magical and conventional weaponry.
   - Regular drills and preparedness exercises should be conducted to ensure readiness.

8. **Trade and Defense Synergy**: 
   - Integrate trade and defense in such a way that each supports the other. For example, trade routes could be designed to double as strategic defense positions.
   - Ensure that economic activities do not hinder defensive capabilities but rather enhance them.

9. **Legal Framework and Enforcement**: 
   - Establish a clear legal framework that outlines security protocols, trade regulations, and penalties for non-compliance.
   - Ensure strict enforcement of these laws, with a fair but firm judicial system to handle violations.

10. **Resilient Infrastructure**: 
    - Design infrastructure to be resilient against sieges or attacks. This includes self-sufficient water and food supplies, emergency shelters, and backup communication systems.

By integrating these elements, the Crystallines can create entry points that are hubs of bustling economic activity and also impregnable fortresses, ensuring both prosperity and security.
