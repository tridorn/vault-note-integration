You meant: "I want an aesthetically pleasing EDC pen with excellent writing feel, complementary to the Falcon, better choice than a Fisher AG7. Which one should I pick?"

* * *

### Decide first: what gap must it fill?

1. **Quick deployment, no uncapping, any paper** (meetings, receipts, cheap forms).

2. **Looks good next to the Falcon** (material/finish coherence).

3. **Refill ecosystem you actually like** (smooth, low-smear, waterproof enough).

Fisher AG7 fails on feel (thick pressurized paste, draggy line) unless you need upsideâ€‘down, wet, or freezing use. Extreme-environment niche, not daily writing.

## Single recommendation (if you want one answer)

**Uni Jetstream Prime Single (metal body) with SXR-5 or SXR-38 refill**

- Writes like the regular Jetstream but housed in a minimalist metal barrel that doesn't look disposable.
- Oil-based low-viscosity ink: instant start, low smear, survives cheap paper.
- Click mechanism, no maintenance, low profile aesthetic.
- Price well below "luxury" but feels intentional, not plasticky.

## If you value an iconic object over refill pragmatism

| Pick | Type | Why it complements Falcon | Trade-off | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Lamy 2000 Ballpoint** | Oil-based ballpoint | Bauhaus macrolon + brushed steel, subdued like the Falcon resin | Proprietary M16 refill is decent, not Jetstream-smooth | 
| **Pilot Vanishing Point (Decimo if you want lighter)** | Fountain pen, click | Same ink feel category as Falcon but instant deploy | More cleaning, still FP maintenance, higher cost | 
| **Tactile Turn Bolt Action (Side Click if you prefer)** | Machined pen accepting Parker-format refills | Industrial elegance, you choose refills (Schmidt EasyFlow 9000, Jetstream, Uniball) | Pricey, heavier, bolt action is louder | 
| **rOtring 600 Ballpoint** | Ballpoint | Matches your 600 pencil aesthetics 1:1 | Grip knurl can fatigue long sessions; refill mediocre unless swapped | 
| **Caran d'Ache 849** | Ballpoint | Slim, colorful or metal finishes, iconic silhouette | Goliath refill is smooth but waxy; limited tip sizes |

### Refill strategy (avoid regret later)

- If you choose a pen that accepts **Parker G2 format**, you can run Jetstream (SXR-600), Schmidt EasyFlow 9000, or Uni 900. That keeps options open.
- Proprietary systems (Lamy M16, Fisher PR) lock you into their feel unless you hack adapters.

### Bottom line

- Want the best writing feel with a clean, non-flashy body: **Jetstream Prime Single**.
- Want design pedigree and a durable object: **Lamy 2000 Ballpoint** or **Tactile Turn Side Click** (load it with a Jetstream-compatible refill).
- Want visual symmetry with your Rotring 600: **rOtring 600 Ballpoint**, but plan to swap the refill.

Pick based on which constraint bites harder: refill performance, design iconography, or match-to-existing gear. If uncertain, default to the Jetstream Prime; you lose nothing and can upgrade the "design piece" later.
