You should have asked: "Define company-wide operating rules, roles, SLAs, and enforcement so non-technical and technical teams can run on the standards-based stack (Git/S3/Postgres + HTTP control plane + event bus) without knowing the underlying tools."

  

# 1) Canonical operating rules

1. Every work item starts as an issue in the correct repo. No ad-hoc tasks.

2. Every change is a PR reviewed by a code owner. No direct pushes to protected branches.

3. Decisions in chat or meetings must be promoted to a canonical artifact within one business day:

    - Policy → docs-policies

    - Org change → org-structure

    - Process/SOP → docs-sops

    - Contract/template → biz-contracts

4. Large files live in S3; Git contains the manifest and metadata only.

5. Identity is central. All access derives from roles defined in Git and applied by automation. No manual grants.

6. All actions are API calls or events. If a tool lacks an API, it is not used for production work.

7. Auditability is non-negotiable. If it isn't in Git, S3, Postgres, or the event log, it did not happen.

  

# 2) Role model and responsibilities

  

Define once, apply everywhere. Managed in infra-identity/roles.yaml.

- Product Owner: prioritises work, approves scope changes, owns docs-roadmap.
- Maintainer (per repo): guards quality, merges PRs, owns releases and runbooks.
- Developer: implements changes, writes tests, keeps artifacts reproducible.
- Operator: executes deployments, handles incidents, manages infra repos.
- Data Steward (per schema): approves schema changes, ensures data quality and retention.
- Security Officer: owns policy, reviews exceptions, incident commander for security.
- HR Administrator: controls org-structure, triggers onboarding/offboarding events.
- Auditor: read-only access, verifies evidence and controls.

# 3) SLAs and SLOs (company-wide baselines)

- PR review: ≤ 2 business days for active repos.
- Incident response: P1 acknowledge ≤ 15 min, mitigate ≤ 2 h; P2 acknowledge ≤ 1 h, mitigate ≤ 8 h.
- Artifact provenance: SBOM + attestation on every release.
- Data freshness SLO (analytics): < 24 h lag unless declared otherwise.
- Access requests via PR to infra-identity: fulfilled ≤ 1 business day.

  

# 4) Workflows by function (tool-independent)

  

## 4.1 HR onboarding/offboarding

- Onboarding: PR to org-structure adds employee with role(s). Merge emits org.employee.added. Automation:

    - Create user in IdP, assign roles.

    - Provision Slack account, group memberships.

    - Open onboarding issue in docs-onboarding with checklist.
- Offboarding: PR removes employee. Event org.employee.removed:

    - Revoke tokens and roles, rotate shared secrets, transfer repo ownerships.
- Evidence: merged PR, event log, IdP change record.

  

## 4.2 Policy and SOP lifecycle

- Draft in branch, open PR with impact section and deprecation plan if applicable.
- Required approvals: Security + one Maintainer outside author's team.
- On merge: policy.updated event; notifications sent; effective date recorded in front-matter.

  

## 4.3 Service change (any stack)

- Issue → branch → tests → build → artifact to S3 with content hash → update deploy manifest in infra-* via PR.
- Required checks: lint, tests, SCA, secret scan, SBOM, provenance.
- Promotion uses environment PRs; prod requires Operator approval and change ticket ID in PR body.
- Rollback = git revert of environment PR; automation redeploys previous artifact by hash.

  

## 4.4 Data change (schemas and retention)

- Schema migrations as SQL files in /db/migrations, versioned and idempotent.
- Data retention policy in data-governance/policies.yaml; enforcement job prunes S3 and partitions accordingly.
- Any PII schema edit requires Security + Data Steward approval; impact assessment attached.

  

# 5) Enforcement and automation

- Repo linter runs nightly across org: verifies required files, CODEOWNERS, CI reference, license, lifecycle label. Posts a report issue per repo.
- Chat bot:

    - Detects "decision made" phrases and prompts to file an issue with a one-click link.

    - Resolves /who-owns <thing> from CODEOWNERS and org-structure.
- Guardrails:

    - Protected branches, signed commits/tags, required checks.

    - Secrets never in repos. CI pulls short-lived credentials from the IdP-linked secrets backend.

    - Manual changes to cloud consoles prohibited; enforcement by least-privilege and audit.

  

# 6) Event taxonomy (minimal, stable)

  

Prefix by domain; evolve via versioned JSON Schemas.

- repo.updated, repo.released
- service.deployed, service.rollback
- infra.plan.created, infra.apply.succeeded|failed
- org.employee.added|removed, identity.role.assigned|revoked
- policy.updated, sop.updated
- db.schema.updated, data.retention.executed
- security.finding.opened|closed, incident.opened|mitigated|postmortem.published

  

Each event includes: actor, repo/schema identifiers, commit SHA, object hash (if any), environment, and a correlation ID.

  

# 7) Naming, discovery, and catalogs

- Repo prefixes by type: code-, infra-, ops-, data-, docs-, biz-, org-.
- Services register in svc-catalog (a Git repo) with:

    - service.yaml containing owners, SLOs, dependencies, API endpoints, data contracts, runbook link.
- Datasets register in data-catalog with schema location, steward, retention class.

  

# 8) Exception handling

- Exceptions live in standards/exceptions.md, each with:

    - Justification, scope, expiry date, compensating controls.
- Security Officer approves; monthly review prunes expired exceptions.

  

# 9) Metrics and reviews

- Hygiene: % repos with required files and CODEOWNERS (target 100).
- Lead time: issue opened → prod deploy (p50, p90).
- Change failure rate and MTTR per service.
- Dependency freshness: median age of open dependency updates.
- Access hygiene: time to revoke on offboarding (target < 15 minutes).
- Quarterly "rails report" published to docs-governance.

  

# 10) Business continuity, backup, and DR

- Git: primary and mirror; nightly verified backups; quarterly restore drills.
- S3: versioning + cross-region replication; lifecycle tiers; quarterly restore drills.
- Postgres: PITR, daily logical dumps; monthly full restore test.
- IdP: export config regularly; break-glass accounts stored in sealed escrow.

  

# 11) Templates and PR gates (copyable)

# 12) Training and adoption cadence

- Week 1--2: mandatory 2-hour training for all staff on issues, PRs, approvals, and finding owners.
- Week 3--6: migrate top 20% critical repos to standards; turn on required checks.
- Week 7--12: enforce org-wide branch protection; move HR and policy documents into Git; enable onboarding/offboarding automation.
- Month 4 onward: quarterly audits; publish rails report; adjust SLAs where data shows friction.

  

# 13) What binds it all

- One identity plane (OIDC) for humans and machines.
- One control plane (HTTP) for all actions.
- One event plane for everything observable.
- One rule: if it bypasses these planes, it's out of policy.

  

This is lean, enforceable, and portable. Start by implementing the repo linter, PR templates, and the HR onboarding/offboarding automation; those three create fast feedback loops that push everyone onto the rails without ceremony.
