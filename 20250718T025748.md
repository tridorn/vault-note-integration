**Clarification:** You might have asked: _"Should I prioritise handle uniformity across platforms or opportunistically secure 'Dornhelm' where available and default to 'TDornhelm' where not? What should be the dominant brand identity--'Dornhelm' or 'Tristan Dornhelm'? How should I approach capitalisation consistency?"_

### Strategic Priorities: Uniformity vs. Primacy

This is not about aesthetics. It's about identity coherence, searchability, and signal consolidation. Handle strategy serves one of two models:

#### 1. **Uniformity Model (Strategic Simplicity)**

- Use **@TDornhelm** universally, regardless of platform-specific availability of shorter variants.
- Benefit: Total handle consistency. No cognitive load for your audience. Every tag, mention, link--predictable.
- Cost: You forgo the marginal elegance of "@Dornhelm" on platforms where it's available.

#### 2. **Optimised-Per-Platform Model (Identity Primacy)**

- Secure **@Dornhelm** where it's available. Fall back to **@TDornhelm** only where necessary.
- Benefit: You foreground the core mononym "Dornhelm" when possible, asserting primacy of name.
- Cost: Fractured discoverability, increased audience friction, marginal dilution unless managed well.

**Verdict:**  
Default to the **Uniformity Model** unless:
- You are creating **compartmentalised sub-brands** per platform (e.g. different content for GitHub vs Instagram), or
- You have a **centralised link-hub strategy** (e.g. everything runs through dornhelm.com), de-risking the handle fragmentation.

For most public figures or persona-building efforts, **uniformity wins**. Consistency compresses effort for others to locate, refer, or cite you--critical for brand growth.

### Brand Focus: **Dornhelm** vs **Tristan Dornhelm**

The handle is not the name. They're related but not interdependent. Choose your brand hierarchy deliberately.

- **Dornhelm** as _persona core_ is leaner, more authoritative, more scalable. Works better as a public-facing signature, blog name, creative label, etc.
- **Tristan Dornhelm** is for full-formal identity use: publishing, bylines, biographical sections.

**Strategy**:

- Use **Dornhelm** as the brand root (handle, domain, site title, project credits).
- Retain **Tristan Dornhelm** for formal, contextual self-reference (bios, CVs, author tags).

### Capitalisation Policy

You're correct: some platforms ignore case, some preserve but don't enforce.

#### Implications:

- **Technically**, handle capitalisation is irrelevant on most platforms.
- **Visually**, standardise: **@TDornhelm** or **@Dornhelm**, but don't rely on casing to communicate brand elements.
- In all content you control (bios, graphics, overlays, slides), **use Title Case consistently**, regardless of how the platform renders it.

### Operational Actions

1. **Secure @Dornhelm** on every platform where it's still open. Even if unused, it's strategic positioning.

2. Decide if you want to make **@TDornhelm** the universal handle even on platforms where @Dornhelm is open. If yes, use @Dornhelm as parked/redirect/alt.

3. Build the **branding hierarchy**:

    - _Name_: Tristan Dornhelm

    - _Persona/Brand_: Dornhelm

    - _Handle_: @TDornhelm (unified)

    - _Domain_: dornhelm.com (strong anchor)

This structure grants maximum flexibility without fracturing identity.
