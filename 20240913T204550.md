# External self talk

Your query might be more precisely framed as: *"How does Stoicism view external self-talk or commentary when alone, such as while watching a series, or spontaneous laughter? Should I aim to control these behaviors, or is spontaneity allowed in a Stoic practice?"*

Stoicism does not advocate for a life devoid of joy, humor, or self-expression. The key lies in **moderation** and **awareness**. Stoic practice is less about suppressing natural, spontaneous reactions like laughter or self-talk and more about ensuring that these reactions remain **within the bounds of reason** and **do not disturb your inner tranquility**. Let’s address these two behaviors in detail:

### 1. **External Self-Talk (Commentary, Monologue)**
Stoicism doesn’t explicitly address external self-talk, but it does emphasize the importance of **reasoned thought** and **self-awareness** in all aspects of life. Talking to oneself, even aloud, is not inherently un-Stoic, but you should consider **why** you are engaging in this behavior and whether it serves a useful purpose.

- **Example of Stoic Reflection**: When watching a series and providing external commentary to yourself, ask: *Is this self-talk helping me reflect or analyze the content more deeply?* If the self-talk enhances your understanding or sharpens your thinking, it could be seen as a productive exercise in reflection. However, if it is simply mindless chatter, you might want to question whether it is in line with temperance and moderation.

**Key Stoic Principle**: As long as your external self-talk is rational and not a sign of emotional agitation or distraction, it is not necessarily in conflict with Stoic practice. The key is that it should be **conscious** and **purposeful**, rather than excessive or out of emotional impulse.

- **Guideline**: Engage in external self-talk if it is helping you to think more clearly or reflect on virtue, but avoid letting it become a habit of unnecessary chatter, which might pull you away from inner calm.

### 2. **Spontaneous Laughter**
Laughter itself is not un-Stoic. In fact, Stoicism does not condemn natural, spontaneous emotions like joy or amusement, as long as they are in harmony with reason and don’t lead to **excess or loss of control**. Marcus Aurelius didn’t advise against laughter, but he did encourage moderation in all emotional expressions, ensuring that they are appropriate to the situation.

- **Example of Laughter**: If you are watching a series and something genuinely humorous happens, a Stoic wouldn’t suppress the urge to laugh out of a strict desire to control all emotional reactions. Laughter is a natural response to humor and, when in moderation, can be a healthy way of experiencing joy.

However, the Stoic approach would be to ensure that **laughter doesn’t descend into excessive or uncontrolled emotional expression**. Stoicism values temperance, which means being aware of how much and when you laugh, ensuring that it doesn’t become frivolous or distract you from more important tasks.

- **Key Stoic Principle**: **Moderate** your laughter. Spontaneous laughter is fine, but remain aware of its appropriateness and whether it aligns with virtue. If it becomes excessive or leads to emotional imbalance, then it might detract from your practice of **temperance**.

### 3. **Balancing Spontaneity and Control**
Stoicism doesn’t demand that you suppress spontaneity altogether. Rather, it teaches that we should maintain **self-mastery** and **conscious awareness** of our actions, ensuring that spontaneous reactions, such as laughter or external self-talk, don’t control us or detract from our ability to act virtuously.

- **Example of Spontaneity**: Laughing at a funny moment is spontaneous and natural, and Stoicism does not ask you to suppress it if it aligns with reason and moderation. Similarly, providing occasional commentary while watching a show might help sharpen your awareness or provide reflection, as long as it doesn’t devolve into distraction or emotional chatter.

**Key Stoic Principle**: Allow spontaneity, but always with an eye on **moderation** and **self-awareness**. You can laugh and express yourself naturally, but keep it within the bounds of reason and virtue.

### Conclusion: Moderation and Consciousness are Central
Stoicism doesn’t require you to suppress natural behaviors like self-talk or laughter, but it asks that you **moderate** these actions and **remain aware** of whether they align with your reasoned pursuit of virtue. 

- **External self-talk** is fine as long as it serves a constructive purpose and doesn’t become an unproductive habit.
- **Spontaneous laughter** is a natural human response and is allowed, provided it is **moderate** and **appropriate** to the situation, without leading to excess.

Ultimately, Stoicism values **self-control**, not suppression, so focus on ensuring that your actions remain guided by virtue and reason, while allowing space for natural, spontaneous reactions where they are healthy and appropriate.
