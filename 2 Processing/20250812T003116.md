Correction: “Design a rational, minimal framework for a free-form physical ‘workbook’ that functions as a half-hour working memory. Specify page anatomy, notation, migration rules, review cadence, and disciplined use of pens and colors.”

Objective

A paper system that preserves free flow yet enforces enough invariants to make entries findable, actionable, and auditable. Minimal scaffolding. No prompts. No templates beyond a stable page skeleton and a compact markup.

Core invariants
	1.	Everything gets a timestamp.
	2.	Every line carries a type marker.
	3.	Tasks leave the page and enter the task system the same day.
	4.	Cross-reference anything worth seeing twice.
	5.	End each day with a 7-minute sweep.

Page anatomy
	•	Header line: YYYY-MM-DD · Day code (D215 if 215th day of year) · location.
	•	Left gutter, 1.5 cm: timestamps and status ticks only.
	•	Body: free-form writing.
	•	Right gutter, 1 cm: page links and thread IDs only.
	•	Footer: page number and book code, e.g., WB-2025Q3-142.

Notation

Use a single leading marker per line, then free text. Combine with time and optional thread.

Time format: 09:00 or 09:00–09:30.
Thread format: [P:FOO] for projects, [T:TOPIC] for themes.

Markers:
	•	A = action in motion now.
	•	t = task candidate to migrate to the task system.
	•	d = decision taken.
	•	n = neutral note or observation.
	•	q = question to resolve.
	•	r = risk or constraint.
	•	w = waiting on X.
	•	↻ = revisit needed; schedule or link.
	•	⊕ = idea worth indexing.

Lifecycle ticks in the left gutter, next to the time:
	•	□ open.
	•	✓ done on page.
	•	→ migrated to system X. Write “→OF” or “→Jira” in right gutter.
	•	✖ dropped, with one-word rationale.

Examples:
09:00 A [P:API] finalize error schema v2.
09:15 t sync with legal on data retention →OF.
09:40 d adopt 30-day rolling logs; exception for audits.
10:05 r [P:API] throughput capped by upstream; test with 1.5× load.
11:00 q What is SLA for partner tier 2?

Color and tools discipline
	•	Fountain pen: body text only.
	•	Micron 01: timestamps, markers, page links.
	•	Micron 005: inline edits and precise corrections.
	•	Midliner: a single accent color per quarter, used for d, r, and ⊕ lines only. No rainbow.
	•	Mechanical pencil: sketch boxes, quick diagrams; ink only after validation.

Daily protocol

Morning open, 3 minutes:
	1.	Write header.
	2.	List three Outcomes as d-lines prefixed “O1…O3”. These are commitments, not wishes.

During the day:
	•	Start each half-hour with a time stamp. If context continues, extend the range.
	•	Keep narrative free. Break lines often. One thought per line.
	•	Convert emerging tasks to t-lines at the moment you recognize them.

Evening sweep, 7 minutes:
	1.	Migrate all t-lines to the task system. Mark each with → and system code.
	2.	Close open A-lines. If not done, convert to t or schedule a block.
	3.	Circle d-lines with Midliner.
	4.	Add page links for anything that needs retrieval: “link: p123” or “cont: p187”.
	5.	Index two to three ⊕ items at the back index.

Weekly cadence
	•	Open a “Week Ledger” on the first page of the week. No template, simple list:
	•	Threads at risk r.
	•	Top three decisions d that changed direction.
	•	Debts: t or w that aged past 5 days.
	•	On Friday, add one paragraph “State of Play” as n-lines. Link to relevant pages.

Threading and cross-refs
	•	Continuation: at end of a block, write “→p187 [P:FOO]”. On p187, begin with “←p142”.
	•	Summaries: when a thread converges, write a single d-line summary and mark ⊕.
	•	Tag pages: tiny diagonal tick on the top-outer corner for pages containing d or r. Quick visual scan.

Migration rules
	•	Tasks: every t-line leaves the book the same day. If you cannot migrate immediately, write a one-word why and set ↻ with a concrete time.
	•	Calendar items: write “cal: 2025-08-12 14:00” on the line and add to calendar during the sweep.
	•	Waiting: w-lines must name the owner and next visible event, e.g., “w Alice, draft by 16:00”. Review all w-lines in the weekly cadence.

Retrieval architecture
	•	Page numbers from the start.
	•	Back-of-book index, alphabetized by thread name. Each entry lists page numbers only. Keep it lean.
	•	Monthly capture: photograph or scan only pages with Midliner marks. File by book code. No full scans unless compliance demands it.

Decision hygiene
	•	Write d-lines in complete sentences with the rationale clause. Example: “d Adopt 30-day logs to simplify audits and cut storage cost.”
	•	If reversed later, write a new d-line that supersedes the old and link both pages.

Constraints to prevent bloat
	•	One quarter, one Midliner color.
	•	One page, one header. Never split days across pages.
	•	No sticky notes inside the book. Transcribe or discard.
	•	No multi-marker lines. If a sentence contains a task and a decision, split it.

Example, condensed

Header: 2025-08-08 · D220 · Berlin
09:00 A [P:API] finalize error schema v2.
09:15 t sync with legal on retention →OF.
09:40 d 30-day rolling logs to reduce audit friction.
10:05 r [P:API] upstream cap; test 1.5× load.
11:00 q Partner tier-2 SLA?
14:30 w Alice, draft SOW by 16:00.
17:35 ⊕ Post-mortem format felt effective; capture template on p190.
Sweep: migrated t, linked →p190, circled d and r.

Implementation sequence

Day 1: adopt markers and page anatomy.
Day 3: enforce the evening sweep without exception.
Day 7: back-index starts.
Day 14: Week Ledger stabilizes.
Day 30: prune any marker you did not use.

This preserves the free-form flow while imposing thin, durable rails. You get continuity across half-hour blocks, clean migration to digital systems, and a reliable audit trail of what you decided, why, and where to find it.
