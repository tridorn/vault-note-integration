Correction: “Define precise margin roles and a mid-page day segmentation method for a multi-page daily log. Rebuild the framework accordingly.”

Design targets

Free flow in the core writing area. Hard constraints in the margins. Days can begin mid-page and expand across pages without ambiguity. Retrieval and migration stay deterministic.

Page geometry (define once per notebook)

Your dotted grid is the unit. I’ll assume 5 mm spacing; adapt the counts if different.
	•	Time Lane (TL): left margin, width 2 cells. Draw a faint vertical guide on the inner edge once per book.
	•	Text Field (TF): center, everything you actually write.
	•	Index Lane (IL): right margin, width 2 cells. Draw a faint vertical guide on the inner edge once per book.
	•	Footer Strip (FS): bottom row, 1 cell tall.

Nothing else goes in the lanes. If you need diagrams, they live entirely inside TF.

What goes where (strict)

Time Lane (TL), top-to-bottom:
	•	Timestamps: “09:00” or “09:00–09:30”. One per entry block.
	•	Status box for the line: □ open, ✓ done, → migrated, ✖ dropped. One glyph per line, aligned with its timestamp.
	•	Continuation arrows only: ↧ at page bottom if the current block continues; ↥ at next page top to pair it.

Index Lane (IL), top-to-bottom:
	•	Cross-page links: “p187”, “↔ p142”.
	•	System migration codes: “→OF”, “→Jira”, “→Cal”.
	•	Thread tags: compact, all-caps, no brackets, e.g., API, LEGAL, HIRING.
	•	Decision/risk flags: small symbols only, no text: ◆ decision, ▲ risk, ⊕ idea worth indexing, ◷ waiting.
	•	Day markers (see below): band label + edge tick.

Footer Strip (FS):
	•	Page ID: book code + page number, e.g., WB-2025Q3-142.
	•	Optional: 2-letter location code. Nothing else.

Text Field (TF):
	•	Everything else: notes, actions, decisions, questions, sketches. One thought per line. No metadata here.

Mid-page day segmentation

Days are “capsules” that can start anywhere and run across pages.

Day Banner (DB): a two-line divider placed in TF wherever the new day starts.
	•	Line 1 (bold/boxed): YYYY-MM-DD · DOW · DayID (D+day-of-year, e.g., D220).
	•	Line 2: O1–O3 outcomes (short, factual).
	•	Draw a thin horizontal rule above and below the banner, across TF only. Do not cross into TL or IL.

Day Edge Tick (DET): in IL, draw a short vertical Midliner tick spanning 3–4 cells aligned to the DB’s first line, plus write the date once, rotated if needed. This gives a fast flip-to-day index.

Day Continuations:
	•	If a day runs off a page, put ↧ in TL on the last line used that page. On the next page, put ↥ in TL at the first continuation line, and repeat the DayID once in IL on that page (“D220 cont.”).
	•	If a day ends mid-page and another begins, insert the next DB immediately; no blank space required.

Entry syntax (unchanged free-form, but line-typed)

Each line in TF begins with a single marker, then content. TL carries the time and status; IL carries the metadata.

Markers in TF:
	•	A action in motion
	•	t task candidate (must migrate same day)
	•	d decision (complete sentence + rationale clause)
	•	n note/observation
	•	q question to resolve
	•	r risk/constraint
	•	w waiting on {owner}, next visible event
	•	↻ revisit at {time/date}
	•	⊕ index-worthy idea (mirror with ⊕ in IL)

Examples (layout implied):
	•	TL: 09:00  □ | TF: A API finalize error schema v2 | IL: API
	•	TL: 09:15  → | TF: t Sync with legal on retention | IL: LEGAL, →OF
	•	TL: 09:40  ✓ | TF: d Adopt 30-day logs to cut audit time by 20% | IL: ◆, API
	•	TL: 10:05  □ | TF: r Upstream cap; test at 1.5× | IL: ▲, API

Color and pen discipline
	•	Fountain pen: TF content.
	•	Micron 01: TL and IL entries, rules, and DB boxes.
	•	Micron 005: inline edits in TF, underlines, micro-arrows.
	•	Midliner: one color per quarter. Use only for DET ticks, DB boxes, and to lightly shade the TF margin next to d and r lines (a 1-cell vertical bar). No coloring in TL/FS.

Day flow protocol (fits variable page spans)

Open (≤3 minutes, when DB is placed):
	1.	Write DB lines and DET tick.
	2.	Record O1–O3 in TF line-typed as d-lines if they are commitments.

During the day:
	•	At each half-hour boundary, add a timestamp in TL. If context continues, extend range (09:00–09:30).
	•	Keep TF free-form but split mixed thoughts: one marker per line.
	•	When a line creates work, mark as t in TF and immediately add the migration target in IL, even if you will migrate at sweep.

Sweep (7 minutes, at the day’s final line wherever it falls):
	1.	Migrate all t lines. Flip □ to → in TL and keep the IL system code.
	2.	Close A lines: ✓ if done; otherwise convert to t or write ↻ with a concrete time.
	3.	Circle d lines in TF with 005; mirror ◆ in IL if missing.
	4.	Add necessary cross-page links in IL (“p190”, “↔ p142”).
	5.	Index 2–3 ⊕ items to the back index.

Weekly ledger (page-agnostic)
	•	Open a “Week Ledger” capsule with its own DB variant: “2025-W32”. Place anywhere, then edge-tick it in IL as “W32”.
	•	Content: top 3 d that changed direction, r at risk, debts (t or w > 5 days). Cross-link pages in IL.

Cross-page mechanics
	•	Continuation links live only in IL:
	•	“→ p187 API” at the end of a block, and “← p142 API” where it resumes.
	•	Summaries: when a thread converges, write one d-line with the conclusion; add ◆ in IL and “SUM” tag.

Constraints that prevent drift
	•	TL and IL widths never change. If space runs tight, TF yields, not the lanes.
	•	No text in lanes beyond their allowed items.
	•	No sticky notes. Transcribe into TF with proper TL/IL metadata.
	•	If a line needs two markers, split it.
	•	If you can’t place a DB for a new day immediately, draw a single Midliner vertical bar in IL where the new day will start. Place the DB at the next pause; back-fill timestamps as needed.

Implementation sequence

Day 1: draw TL/IL guides in the whole book, set FS format.
Day 2: practice DB + DET, start using continuation arrows.
Day 3: enforce sweep.
Day 7: start Week Ledger pages and back index.

This rebuild gives you unambiguous day boundaries mid-page, fixed roles for each margin, and zero metadata leakage into the writing field. Entries remain fluid; navigation, migration, and audit become mechanical.
