Below is a **minimal-yet-complete lifecycle spine**--seven stages, one support area--designed so every note sits in _exactly one_ folder at any moment. Each stage answers a single question about the note's status, keeping the flow unambiguous.

* * *

## 1 Guiding axioms

| Axiom | Practical effect | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Single-status rule** | A note lives in only one stage; transitions are explicit moves (Git treats moves atomically). | 
| **Verb-driven names** | Folder titles describe the _action currently happening_ to the note. | 
| **Shortest viable path** | Only seven lifecycle stages; everything else is handled by links/tags, not deeper folders. | 
| **System vs. Content** | Operational files are isolated in `00_System`, never mixed with notes. | 
* * *

## 2 Folder map
    
    
    00_System/         # templates, snippets, media, logs
    01_Capture/        # I just grabbed it
    02_Triage/         # I'm deciding what it is
    03_Plan/           # I committed to do something with it
    04_Work/           # I'm actively shaping it
    05_Deliver/        # It reached "done" and is published/handed off
    06_Learn/          # I'm extracting insights & retrospective notes
    07_Library/        # Evergreen knowledge for future reuse
    98_Archive/        # Cold storage (anything obsolete or finished >1y)
    

### Optional fine-grain (one level deep, if you _need_ it)
    
    
    01_Capture/
        Quick_Notes/   Web_Clips/   Voice_Memos/
    
    02_Triage/
        Do_Now/        Delegate/    Defer/       Reference/
    
    03_Plan/
        Projects/      Tasks/       Schedules/
    
    04_Work/
        Drafting/      Research/    Prototyping/
    
    05_Deliver/
        Reports/       Articles/    Releases/
    
    06_Learn/
        Journal/       Reviews/     Lessons/
    
    07_Library/
        Concepts/      Methods/     Resources/
    

Feel free to skip any sub-folder until it becomes useful; the top-level seven are sufficient.

## 4 Working example

1. **Idea jotted** → `01_Capture/note.md`

2. **Daily triage** decides it's a future article → `03_Plan/Projects/Article_AI/`

3. **Deep work** on outline → `04_Work/Drafting/Article_AI.md`

4. **Publish** PDF → `05_Deliver/Articles/AI_article.pdf`

5. **Write retro** → `06_Learn/Reviews/AI_article_retro.md`

6. **Distill key prompt techniques** → `07_Library/Methods/Prompt_Engineering.md`

7. **One year later** entire project folder moves to `98_Archive/Projects/`

## 5 Why this stays elegant

- **No overlap**: every stage is mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive.
- **Predictable moves**: you always know the _next_ folder a note should enter.
- **Flat cognition**: only seven items to keep in your head.
- **Git-friendly**: renames are rare; history mirrors real progress.

Adopt this as-is or rename verbs to match your vocabulary--the logic will remain clear-cut and consistent.
