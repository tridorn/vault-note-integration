# How to Use the Cornell Note-Taking System

"Could you provide me with more concrete advice on how to use the Cornell note-taking system?"

Certainly! To master the **Cornell note-taking system**, it’s essential to break it down into its distinct sections and understand how each part functions, not just mechanically, but strategically. Here’s a step-by-step approach to using it effectively, with specific advice for each section and examples:

### 1. **The Cornell Structure: The Three Key Sections**

The Cornell method divides your page into three parts:

- **Notes (Right Column)**: The largest section where you jot down the main content during lectures, readings, or presentations.
- **Cues (Left Column)**: After the session, use this section to write questions, keywords, and prompts that help you interact with the material.
- **Summary (Bottom Section)**: A brief wrap-up of the most important points, created after the note-taking session to consolidate your understanding.

### 2. **Step-by-Step Usage of Cornell Note-Taking**

#### A. **Before the Session: Prepare the Page**

- Divide your page (or digital note) into the three sections:
	- **Notes Section (Right Column)**: Around 70% of the page.
	- **Cues Section (Left Column)**: 30% of the page.
	- **Summary Section (Bottom)**: A small box at the bottom for your final thoughts.

- **Set Goals**: Know what you want to achieve with the session (reading, lecture, or video). This primes your mind to focus on relevant information.

#### B. **During the Session: Capture Key Ideas in the Notes Section**

This is where most of the content goes during the session. The goal here is **not** to write down everything but to capture key ideas, facts, and examples concisely. Think of this as the **raw material** for your later processing.

**Tips**:
- **Paraphrase**: Avoid writing verbatim quotes (unless necessary). Use your own words to condense and summarize what’s being said or written. This forces active engagement.
  - Example: Instead of writing "Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it," you could summarize it as: “Leadership = motivating others to align their actions with a shared goal.”
  
- **Abbreviations and Symbols**: Use shorthand, symbols, or abbreviations to speed up note-taking and reduce cognitive load.
  - Example: Use **->** for "leads to," **+** for "adds," **\** for contrast, or **#** for key concepts.

- **Structure**: Write in bullet points, numbers, or short paragraphs. Avoid full sentences unless you need precise wording. Use indentation to group related ideas.
  - Example:

	 ```
    - Key idea: Cognitive biases affect decision-making.
        - E.g., confirmation bias: seeking info that supports preconceptions.
        - Loss aversion: more likely to avoid losses than seek gains.
    ```

#### C. **After the Session: Fill in the Cues Section**

Immediately after your session (reading, lecture, etc.), review the notes and fill in the **Cues Section** (left column). This section is where the **interaction** with the material happens. You are creating the foundation for further thinking and deeper understanding.

**What Goes in the Cues Section**:
- **Keywords**: Key terms or concepts that encapsulate the material. These will act as anchors when reviewing the notes.
  - Example: "Confirmation Bias," "Leadership by Example."
  
- **Questions**: These should prompt further reflection, analysis, or exploration. Ask open-ended questions that challenge your understanding.
  - Example: “How does confirmation bias impact team decision-making?” or “How can I model leadership behavior without micromanaging?”

- **Connections**: Write down references to related ideas, frameworks, or concepts from previous notes or other subjects.
  - Example: “Connects to Stoic concept of focusing only on controllables.”
  
**Tips for Cues Section**:
- **Engage Your Brain**: This section transforms passive note-taking into active learning. By summarizing, questioning, and connecting ideas, you start to internalize the information.
- **Keep It Concise**: This section should be filled with brief prompts, not detailed summaries.

#### D. **Summarize the Content in the Bottom Section**

The **Summary** section is where you consolidate your learning by distilling the most important takeaways. This should be a concise reflection of the entire note, capturing the main ideas in your own words.

**What to Include**:
- **Main Themes**: Boil down the essence of the session into a few sentences.
  - Example: “Leadership requires aligning team members’ personal motivations with group goals. Cognitive biases like confirmation bias influence decision-making.”
  
- **Personal Interpretation**: Feel free to add personal insights or how this connects to your broader goals.
  - Example: “I need to be aware of my own biases when leading AMUs to ensure objective decision-making.”

**Tips**:
- **Use This as a Memory Hook**: When reviewing notes later, the summary is the first thing you’ll check to refresh your understanding.
- **Concise, Yet Complete**: Summaries should give a snapshot of the session without needing to review the entire notes section.

### 3. **Concrete Examples for Different Mediums**

#### **A. Example for a Lecture on Cognitive Biases in Decision-Making**

- **Notes (Right Column)**:

	 ```
    - Cognitive biases affect decision-making, often leading to suboptimal choices.
    - Confirmation bias: We seek info that supports our beliefs, ignore contrary evidence.
    - Loss aversion: Tendency to fear losses more than value gains.
        - E.g., reluctance to sell declining stocks due to potential loss.
    ```

- **Cues (Left Column)**:
	 - "Confirmation bias, loss aversion"
	 - "Why is loss aversion more powerful than seeking gains?"
	 - "How can I avoid confirmation bias when gathering information for AMU projects?"
	 - "Connect this to Daniel Kahneman’s System 1 & System 2 thinking."

- **Summary (Bottom Section)**:

	 ```
    - Cognitive biases distort rational decision-making. Confirmation bias and loss aversion are key factors. Need to implement bias awareness in decision frameworks for better team outcomes.
    ```

#### **B. Example for a Book on Leadership**

- **Notes (Right Column)**:

	 ```
    - Leaders model behavior, influence actions by example, not just instructions.
    - Leaders need to demonstrate trustworthiness to build credibility.
    - Clarity is key: Leaders provide clear goals and vision.
    - Micromanagement undermines trust, leads to inefficiency.
    ```

- **Cues (Left Column)**:
	 - "Leadership by example, trust"
	 - "How can I provide clarity without micromanaging?"
	 - "How does clarity in leadership contribute to higher performance?"
	 - "Connect to AMU leadership principles."

- **Summary (Bottom Section)**:

	 ```
    - Leadership is about clarity and trust. Leaders must model behavior they expect from others. Over-involvement (micromanaging) erodes team autonomy and efficiency.
    ```

#### **C. Example for a Podcast on Innovation Strategy**

- **Notes (Right Column)**:

	 ```
    - Innovation requires a balance of risk-taking and structure.
    - Companies must encourage creativity but also maintain a clear strategy.
    - Failure is part of innovation—learn from mistakes and iterate quickly.
    ```

- **Cues (Left Column)**:
	 - "Risk-taking, structure, failure"
	 - "How can failure be framed as a learning process in AMU?"
	 - "How do you balance creative freedom with strategic goals in innovation teams?"
	 - "Connect to lean startup methodology."
  
- **Summary (Bottom Section)**:

	 ```
    - Innovation involves balancing risk with strategy. Encouraging creativity while maintaining a clear direction is crucial. Failure should be seen as a necessary step toward success.
    ```

### 4. **Review And Retention**

Cornell notes are especially useful for review. The structure enables **active recall**, a proven method for improving retention:

- **Cover the Notes Section**: When reviewing, cover the right-hand column and use the **Cues** to test yourself on key ideas.
- **Answer the Questions**: Actively attempt to answer the questions from the Cues section. If you struggle, revisit the Notes section to fill in gaps.
- **Summarize Again**: If needed, rewrite the Summary after a week or two to reinforce what you've learned.

### 5. **Adapting The Cornell Method for Obsidian or Digital Notes**

If you’re using digital note-taking tools like Obsidian, you can easily adapt this system:

- **Create Headings**: Instead of dividing the page, create headings for each section: **Notes**, **Cues**, and **Summary**.
- **Link Ideas**: In the Cues section, use links to other notes in your system to connect related concepts or to trigger further research.
- **Use Templates**: Create a **Cornell Note Template** in Obsidian that automatically provides the structure, so you don’t have to set it up manually each time.

### Conclusion: Why Cornell Works

The Cornell method's strength lies in its simplicity and structure. It not only helps you capture information but also forces interaction through cues and summaries, pushing you toward active engagement and retention. Whether used for reading, lectures, or meetings, it transforms passive note-taking into a powerful tool for learning and applying knowledge.
