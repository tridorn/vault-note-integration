"Could you specify how I should approach note-taking for any medium?"

For effective note-taking across various mediums—whether you’re reading a book, listening to a podcast, attending a lecture, or watching a video—you need tailored strategies that suit the specific nature of the content. Each medium requires a slightly different approach for capturing, processing, and applying information. Below is a structured guide that applies various frameworks based on the medium in question.

### 1. **Books (Reading)**

#### Frameworks to Use

- **SQR3** for reading comprehension.
- **Input → Process → Output** for structured synthesis.
- **Cornell Method** for chapter-by-chapter breakdowns.

#### Approach

**Pre-Reading**:
- **Survey**: Skim the table of contents and chapter headings to get a broad overview.
- **Question**: Based on your goals, create a list of questions you hope the reading will answer.

**During Reading**:
- **Active Reading (SQR3)**: As you read, try to actively look for answers to your pre-formed questions. Highlight or note down key points in the margins or a separate notebook.
- **Cornell Method**: In your notes, use the Cornell structure: write brief notes or quotes in the right column and pose questions or keywords on the left side.

**Post-Reading**:
- **Summarize**: After finishing the chapter or section, summarize the key points in your own words.
- **Process (Input → Process → Output)**:
- **Input**: Summarize the chapter in Obsidian, distilling the most important insights.
- **Process**: Reflect on how these insights answer your questions or how they relate to other concepts in your knowledge base.
- **Output**: Write down actionable steps or new questions that arise.

#### Example

For a book on decision-making:

- **Pre-Reading Question**: "How do biases influence decision-making in teams?"

- **Cornell Note Example**:

```

# Notes (Right Column):  
- Cognitive biases often prevent optimal decision-making.

- Groupthink emerges in cohesive teams, leading to poor outcomes.

# Cues (Left Column):  
- Groupthink, cognitive biases

- How can groupthink be avoided?

# Summary (Bottom):  
- Decision-making is heavily influenced by biases and can be mitigated through awareness of these biases.

```

- **Input Layer in Obsidian**:

```

- Biases, like groupthink, distort rational decision-making. Awareness and structured frameworks can mitigate these biases.

```

- **Process Layer**:

```

- How can I create decision-making frameworks that reduce groupthink?

```

- **Output Layer**:

```

- Implement bias-awareness training and decision checkpoints in AMU missions.

```

### 2. **Lectures Or Classes**

#### Frameworks to Use

- **Cornell Note-Taking** for real-time note organization.
- **Feynman Technique** for deeper understanding.
- **Input → Process → Output** for post-lecture synthesis.

#### Approach

**During the Lecture**:
- **Cornell Method**: Use the right-hand column to take notes during the lecture, jotting down key points, examples, and explanations. On the left side, write down any questions or keywords that arise as the lecturer speaks. 

**After the Lecture**:
- **Review**: Immediately after the lecture, add cues (questions or prompts) to the left column and write a summary at the bottom of your notes.
- **Feynman Technique**: Try explaining key concepts from the lecture in your own words. If you find gaps in your understanding, revisit your notes or the lecture material.

**Post-Lecture (Input → Process → Output)**:
- **Input**: Transfer your notes into Obsidian by summarizing key points from the lecture in your own words.
- **Process**: Use the questions or problems identified during the lecture as prompts for critical thinking.
- **Output**: Create action items or steps based on the insights from the lecture (e.g., further research, applying the concept to a project).

#### Example

A lecture on leadership:

- **Cornell Notes (During)**:

```

# Notes (Right Column):  
- Leadership is about creating clarity for others, not just giving orders.

- Leaders need to demonstrate values in their actions.

# Cues (Left Column):  
- Clarity, leadership by example

- How do leaders create clarity without micromanaging?

# Summary (Bottom):  
- The essence of leadership is demonstrating values through actions and creating a clear vision for the team.

```

- **Input Layer in Obsidian**:

```

- Leaders provide clarity and model values, avoiding micromanagement through clear communication.

```

- **Process Layer**:

```

- How can I improve clarity within my team without overwhelming them with too many instructions?

```

- **Output Layer**:

```

- In the next AMU cycle, focus on creating a vision document for the mission that provides clarity without needing constant oversight.

```

### 3. **Podcasts, Videos, or Webinars**

#### Frameworks to Use

- **Mind Mapping** for non-linear exploration.
- **Feynman Technique** for post-consumption comprehension.
- **Zettelkasten** for connecting insights across different topics.

#### Approach

**During Listening/Viewing**:
- **Mind Mapping**: While listening, create a visual map of the main ideas and their interconnections. Draw branches for each new concept that links back to the main topic.
- **Capture Key Insights**: Write down any particularly striking insights or ideas as they arise. You can also add cues for further reflection or research.

**After Listening/Viewing**:
- **Feynman Technique**: Immediately after the podcast or video, explain the key ideas to yourself or someone else in simple terms. This ensures you've truly understood the material.
- **Zettelkasten**: Connect the insights from the podcast to other relevant topics or notes in your Zettelkasten system. For instance, link a leadership insight from a podcast to related notes on organizational culture.

**Post-Consumption (Input → Process → Output)**:
- **Input**: Summarize the key ideas from the podcast or video in a few bullet points.
- **Process**: Reflect on how the insights apply to other concepts or projects you're working on. Use links to related notes.
- **Output**: List any actions or experiments you want to try based on what you’ve learned.

#### Example

Listening to a podcast on productivity:

- **Mind Map**:

- Central Node: Productivity

- Branches: Time-blocking, Deep Work, Task Prioritization

- **Feynman Technique (Post-Podcast)**:

- "Time-blocking means setting aside specific times for certain tasks without interruption. Deep Work refers to focused, undistracted work on cognitively demanding tasks."

- **Input Layer in Obsidian**:

```

- Time-blocking helps focus on important tasks, while Deep Work ensures high productivity.

```

- **Process Layer**:

```

- How can I implement time-blocking and Deep Work into my daily schedule?

```

- **Output Layer**:

```

- Start by reserving two uninterrupted hours each morning for Deep Work.

```

### 4. **Conversations, Meetings, or Interviews**

#### Frameworks to Use

- **Cornell Method** for real-time capturing of points and questions.
- **SMART Goals** for turning insights into actions.
- **Input → Process → Output** for reflection and next steps.

#### Approach

**During the Conversation**:
- **Cornell Method**: Take notes in real-time using the right-hand column to record key points, arguments, and decisions made. In the left-hand column, note any questions, areas of ambiguity, or ideas for follow-up.

**After the Conversation**:
- **Review and Summarize**: Immediately after, review the conversation notes and summarize key takeaways in the Cornell bottom section.
- **SMART Goals**: Based on the conversation, set specific, actionable goals. Ensure that these goals are measurable and time-bound (e.g., follow up with Person X by next week, clarify issue Y before project launch).

**Post-Conversation (Input → Process → Output)**:
- **Input**: Write a concise summary of the conversation in Obsidian.
- **Process**: Reflect on the implications or action items from the meeting and link them to other projects or notes.
- **Output**: List out specific tasks and deadlines based on what was discussed.

#### Example

A business meeting on project strategy:

- **Cornell Notes (During)**:

```

# Notes (Right Column):  
- Project milestones need to be re-evaluated based on the latest client feedback.

- Marketing and product teams need better communication.

# Cues (Left Column):  
- Milestones, client feedback, cross-team communication

- How can marketing and product teams collaborate more effectively?

# Summary (Bottom):  
- The project timeline will shift to accommodate new client needs. Improved cross-team communication is necessary.

```

- **SMART Goals**:

```

- Specific: Set up weekly check-ins between marketing and product teams.

- Measurable: Ensure that 80% of milestones are hit within the new timeline.



- Achievable: Adjust the timeline based on team capacity.
- Relevant: Client needs are the priority; the timeline should reflect this.
- Time-bound: Weekly check-ins start Monday; new timeline finalized by Friday.

```

- **Input Layer in Obsidian**:

```

- The project will be adjusted to meet new client demands, and cross-team communication needs improvement.

```

- **Process Layer**:

```

- How can we improve collaboration between marketing and product teams?

```

- **Output Layer**:
