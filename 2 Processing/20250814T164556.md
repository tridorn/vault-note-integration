Better: "Design a medium-agnostic, markdown-backed note system that exploits analogue capture for cognition and digital structure for retrieval. Provide workflow, templates, file schema, and review cadence, optimised for two books per week."

  

Here is a compact, operational framework you can run tomorrow. It is source-centric, ID-driven, and bias-to-action.

  

# Architecture

  

Principle: analogue for thinking, digital for searching and recombining.

1. Capture. Handwritten first. Use index cards, margins, post-its, wallboards. One thought per slip.

2. Distil. Same day. Convert slips into atomic statements with evidence and implication.

3. Encode. Type into markdown with strict metadata and stable IDs.

4. Link. Connect ideas across sources and projects. Build maps of content.

5. Rehearse. Run spaced prompts on decision-relevant notes. Archive the rest.

  

# Identifiers and filing

  

Use one namespace for everything.

  

• Note ID: yyyymmddhhmm-slug (example: 20250814-pricing-fences).

• Source ID: src-type-author-year-slug (example: src-book-dunford-2019-obviously-awesome).

• Directory layout:
    
    
    /notes/
      20250814-pricing-fences.md
      20250815-jtb-progress.md
    /sources/
      src-book-dunford-2019-obviously-awesome/
        source.md            # bibliographic card
        excerpts.md          # selected passages with locators
        claims.md            # distilled claims, one per line with IDs
    /maps/                   # maps of content (topic indexes)
    /projects/               # active builds or experiments referencing notes
    /_inbox/                 # transient scans/photos awaiting encoding

# Card types (few, powerful)

  

Keep taxonomy minimal to avoid meta-work.

  

• Claim. Verifiable statement summarising an argument from a source.

• Principle. Cross-context rule you will reuse.

• Pattern. Situation → response that tends to work.

• Metric. Definition and guardrail.

• Play. Stepwise tactic you can execute.

• Counterexample. Where a rule fails and why.

• Question. Open issue tied to a decision.

• Quote. Only when wording adds force.

    ## Statement
    Customers reveal willingness-to-pay through fenced offers before you finalise packaging.
    
    ## Evidence
    Interview set A (n=8) showed 3 clusters reacting to the same fence at different price points.
    
    ## Implication
    Design two packages that separate high-urgency buyers without discounting core value.
    
    ## Action
    Run landing test: 2 fences, target CTR ≥ 2.5%, qualified reply rate ≥ 10%.

# Analogue workflow that scales

  

Use paper deliberately, not nostalgically.

  

• Pre-print 100 small stickers with short IDs (e.g., PF-01..PF-100) each week. Place a sticker on any index card or margin note you intend to keep. Write the full timestamp ID later during encoding.

• One idea per card. Force you to split.

• Margin coding: circle for claim, triangle for question, square for play. Fast visual sort during distillation.

• End of day: photograph the keepers into the digital inbox. No beautification.

• Cull rate target: keep ≤ 30% of analogue scraps. Scarcity increases signal.

  

# Distillation rules

  

You are converting mush into decisions.

1. Paraphrase first. Only quote if wording is non-fungible.

2. Each atomic note must contain statement, evidence, and implication. If one is missing, it is not worth keeping.

3. Tie every note to a decision or an experiment. If no candidate action exists, archive it cold.

4. Merge duplicates weekly. Keep the stronger evidence chain, redirect links.

  

# Retrieval and reuse

  

Design for speed under pressure.

  

• Tags are controlled vocabulary. Keep a closed list under /maps/_tags.md. Examples: strategy, pricing, segmentation, pmf, growth, experiment, analytics, ux, sales, negotiation, research, moat, ops.

• Links beat tags. Prefer explicit links between notes and projects.

• Two keystone maps to maintain: map-pricing, map-customer-discovery. Add new maps only when five or more high-quality notes cluster.

• Project files pull in notes by link, not by copy. This prevents divergence.

  

# Review cadence

  

Tight loops, small cost.

  

• Daily, 15 minutes. Empty _inbox, distil three cards minimum.

• Friday, 30 minutes. Link pass: add or fix five links. Kill two weak notes.

• Monthly, 45 minutes. Promote the most used notes to "applied" and record outcomes in the note footer. Archive dead topics to /archive/.

  

# Spaced prompts for retention

  

Only rehearse leverage.

  

• Mark 10 to 20 notes as "rehearsing". Add a one-line cloze in each note footer:
    
    
    Q: Best early CAC proxy for cold outbound? A: reply rate by ICP.

• Review on a 2, 7, 21, 60 day schedule. Demote notes that never influence a decision.

  

# Specialisation across media

  

Same schema, different locators.

  

• Books: source_loc = chX pY.

• Papers: section pY figureZ. Attach PDF page ref.

• Videos/Podcasts: timestamp mm:ss. Transcribe only decision-relevant segments.

• Talks/Meetings: agenda item. Attach outcome and owner.

• Web articles: url + access date. Pull excerpts, avoid full dumps.

  

# Operating constraints that keep it sharp

  

• Hard limit of 10 kept notes per book chapter or per hour of audio. You are optimising selectivity, not completeness.

• For every five notes created, one play must be specified and scheduled in a real project. Otherwise you are hoarding.

• Quote density under 10%. Paraphrase to think.

• If a note is not linked within seven days, it reverts to _inbox and is up for deletion.

  

# Example per-book cycle (3.5 days)

  

Day 1: read and mark analogue, 30 to 60 slips.

Day 2 morning: distil to 10 atomic notes and one source dossier update. Afternoon: link pass.

Day 3: apply one play in a live experiment. Record guardrails and outcome stub.

Half day: write a 200-word synthesis in the source dossier, prune three notes.

  

# Trade-offs

  

• Analogue boosts idea formation, but adds capture overhead. You pay the tax once, recover it in faster synthesis and stronger memory.

• Strict metadata takes seconds per note, but collapses retrieval time later when you are under deadline.

• Fewer, denser notes reduce serendipity but increase hit rate on decisions. For an operator, this is the right bias.

  

# Minimal kit

  

Analogue: index cards, fine pen, small sticker sheet for weekly short IDs, clipboard.

Digital: a plain text editor with good search, a git repo for versioning, a script or shortcut that inserts the front-matter scaffold and timestamp.

  

If you want, I will generate the folder skeleton and markdown scaffolds tailored to your first two syllabus weeks so you can start populating immediately.
