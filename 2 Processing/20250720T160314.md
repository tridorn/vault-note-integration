Yes, you **can** put comments like `# description` inside YAML frontmatter **in Obsidian**, but whether you **should** depends on **your tooling stack and tolerance for parser edge cases**.

Here's a clear breakdown:

* * *

## ✅ Yes -- Comments are technically allowed
- YAML supports comments using `#` -- both inline and on standalone lines.
- Obsidian **does not break** when you include comments in YAML frontmatter.
- This can make your frontmatter easier to **scan and maintain**, especially in complex structures.

**Example (fully valid in Obsidian and YAML parsers):**
    
    
    # ─── CORE IDENTITY ─────────────────────────────────

## ⚠️ Caveats -- When comments might cause issues

| Tool | Behavior | 
| ---- | ----  |
| **Obsidian (core)** | ✅ Fine with comments; Dataview reads around them. | 
| **Dataview plugin** | ✅ Comments are ignored (YAML is parsed properly). | 
| **DataviewJS** | ✅ Works--comments are stripped during YAML parsing. | 
| **Advanced YAML plugins / metadata queries** | ✅ Generally okay if they use a YAML-compliant parser. | 
| **External scripts (Python, Node, Go)** | ⚠️ Some strict parsers will **break** if you don't use a real YAML parser (e.g. `yaml.safe_load`). Avoid plain regex. | 
| **Static site generators** (e.g. Hugo, Jekyll) | ⚠️ May ignore/strip comments in YAML frontmatter. | 

**Bottom line:**  
If you write your own tools/scripts, ensure you use a real YAML parser like:

- Python: `pyyaml` or `ruamel.yaml`
- JavaScript: `yaml` or `js-yaml`
- Go: `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`
* * *

## ✅ Best Practices for Using Comments in YAML Frontmatter

- **Group with headers**: Use decorative headers like `# ─── SECTION ───` only between logical blocks.
- **Don't comment inside lists**: YAML lists with `- item` are fragile to inline comments if not spaced carefully.

✅ Safe:
    
        tags:
      - #concept
      - #retrospective
    

⚠️ Less safe:
    
        tags:  # topic tags
      - #concept  # main category
      - #retrospective  # sub-category
    

- **Avoid using comments as data**: Never write things you plan to parse in `# comments`; put them in real fields.

## ✳️ Recommendation for You

Given your system is:

- Structured,
- Automated (linters, scripts),
- YAML-based (not Markdown-style metadata),
- Obsidian + Git + external tooling,

You **can and should** use comments in YAML for **section headers** and **clarity**, as long as:
- They are used _above_ blocks, not inline with values,
- Your automation stack uses real YAML parsers (not line-by-line grepping).

This will make your metadata not only machine-readable but **human-legible**, which pays dividends over time.

Would you like me to give you a preformatted comment-safe YAML template file with correct indentation, ordering, and comment usage for use in your vault?
