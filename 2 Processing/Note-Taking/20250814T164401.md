Better: "Design a cross-medium, modality-agnostic note-taking framework that can be applied to books but extends to any source. Ensure the system integrates analogue capture for cognition and digital structuring for retrieval, preserving a unified pipeline."

* * *

## Core premise

  

You are not designing "pretty notes," you are building an evidence and synthesis pipeline. Analogue capture improves immediate engagement and comprehension; digital structuring preserves permanence, searchability, and reuse. The system must enforce separation between raw intake, processing, and distillation while keeping transitions low-friction.

* * *

## System architecture

  

### 1. Capture Layer (Analogue-first when possible)

  

Purpose: Bind attention to the material and stimulate processing in working memory.

Methods: Marginalia, index cards, post-its, wallboards.

Constraints:

- Keep raw marks atomic: one idea per card/post-it/note block.
- Include a source anchor: page, timestamp, or reference tag.
- Avoid over-summarising in the moment; focus on triggers (keywords, diagrams, connections).

  

### 2. Processing Layer (Transitional)

  

Purpose: Move from unstructured analogue fragments to coherent digital records without losing context.

Method:

- At defined intervals (end of reading session or daily), transcribe analogue capture into a digital scratchpad in markdown.
- Use immutable intake logs: list raw entries exactly as recorded, no rewriting yet.
- Tag entries with source metadata (#book/TheMomTest #chapter/3).

  

### 3. Distillation Layer (Digital-first)

  

Purpose: Strip noise, merge duplicates, and extract the operationally relevant essence.

Method:

- In markdown, create Concept Notes: one file per idea, rule, or framework.
- Rewrite in your own language; attach examples or test scenarios relevant to current work.
- Link to other notes via wiki-style links ([[Lean_Canvas]]) to form a knowledge graph.
- Maintain an Action Hooks section in each note for possible applications.

  

### 4. Synthesis Layer (Output-focused)

  

Purpose: Turn stored knowledge into leverage.

Method:

- Every week, review the last set of distilled notes.
- Create 1--2 Synthesis Notes that combine multiple sources into a framework, checklist, or decision rule.
- Store synthesis notes in a dedicated frameworks/ folder in markdown.
- Attach a validation plan: criteria for when the idea should be tested in practice.

## Medium-specific adaptations

- Analogue (capture): Use index cards for atomic ideas, colour-code by domain (product, sales, etc.). Use wallboards for mapping frameworks visually before distillation.
- Digital (processing & distillation): Markdown for permanence; backlinks for synthesis.
- Hybrid: Photograph wallboards and attach them to relevant concept notes for visual memory cues.
* * *

## Routines and Decision Points

- Daily: Transcribe analogue → digital (processing layer).
- Weekly: Distil raw logs → concept notes; review synthesis backlog.
- Monthly: Prune and merge redundant notes; tag tested frameworks.
- Kill Rule: If a note remains #raw after 30 days, discard or archive it--if it wasn't worth processing, it's not worth storing.

If you like, I can give you a single markdown template that works for raw capture, concept distillation, and synthesis so that your whole library stays structurally consistent while adapting to the analogue+digital pipeline. Would you like me to prepare that?
