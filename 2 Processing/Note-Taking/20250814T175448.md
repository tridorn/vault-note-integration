Better: "Rebuild my note system around a mobile analogue 'workbook' as the control plane, integrating index cards and other media with a markdown knowledge base. Specify roles, thread grammar, IDs, workflows, templates, review cadence, metrics, and failure modes."

  

Here is a clean architecture that treats your workbook as the command console, not the warehouse.

  

# Core principles

1. One control plane. The workbook captures and routes thinking, but never becomes the archive.

2. One canonical store. Markdown files hold the durable record and links.

3. Analogue for cognition, digital for retrieval. Cards and wallboards for idea formation, markdown for search and recombination.

4. Stable IDs across all surfaces. Everything links by ID, not by title.

5. Bias to action. Notes exist to drive decisions, experiments, or deliverables.

  

# Components and roles

  

Workbook. Daily ledger and router. Holds threads with lightweight structure and IDs.

Index cards. Atomic captures in the field. One idea per card.

Whiteboards and post-its. Temporary synthesis and sequencing. Photograph; treat as sources.

Markdown vault. Canonical notes, decisions, experiments, maps, projects.

Task manager and calendar. Execution surfaces. Only store tasks and time blocks.

Project repos. Where the actual work ships. Link back using IDs.

  

# Global IDs and linking

  

ID format to write fast by hand, then expand digitally.

Short ID on paper: YYDOY-SS (year, day-of-year, sequence). Example: 25227-03.

Full ID in markdown: 2025-08-15T0934-dec-pricing-fence.

Link syntax in markdown: [[full-id]]. In the workbook, write just the short ID plus thread code.

  

# Workbook as control plane

  

You keep your "thread" habit. We add a thread grammar so every paragraph is machine- and human-parseable.

  

Thread header pattern
    
    
    [CODE] YYDOY-SS  Title, 3--7 words

Codes

- WIP. What I am doing now.
- DEC. Decision under consideration.
- EXP. Experiment planning or results.
- Q. Question to resolve.
- TASK. Action item to push to task manager.
- REF. Reading or source capture.
- MTG. Meeting notes.
- LOG. Status or observation.
- IDEA. Raw concept that may spawn notes or experiments.

  

Thread body structure

- Context. One sentence.
- Signal. Evidence or observation.
- Implication. So what.
- Next. Single concrete action or where it routes.

  

Example workbook entry
    
    
    [DEC] 25227-03  Positioning fence for v0
    Context: Enterprise leads balk at bundle; SMBs accept.
    Signal: 4/7 enterprise calls asked for modularity; SMB CTR +38% on bundle.
    Implication: Split enterprise with fence, keep SMB bundle.
    Next: Create decision record; test two fences this week; link EXP 25227-04.

Daily sweep. Once per day, you process every open thread:

- DEC becomes a Decision Record in markdown.
- EXP becomes an Experiment spec or result.
- REF spawns source notes or card IDs.
- TASK gets pushed to the task manager with the short ID in the task title for traceability.
- Link each created artifact back to the workbook entry by writing the new full ID in the margin.

  

# Index cards and other analogue media

  

Card layout

Front: Title. Statement. Evidence. Implication.

Back: Short ID, Type, Source locator, Tags, Links, Next.

  

Edge coding for fast sort

Top-right dot = Principle. Top-left slash = Pattern. Bottom-right square = Metric. Bottom-left triangle = Question. Right-edge notch = Action present.

  

Card flow

- Capture anywhere.
- Photograph at day's end into /_inbox.
- During sweep, type only the cards that matter. Assign full IDs, link into maps or projects.
- Use a 5-slot Leitner box for the few cards worth rehearsing.

# Workflows

  

Daily, 30--45 minutes

- Open workbook. Start with one WIP thread stating focus.
- Capture naturally during the day. Use short IDs.
- Sweep once. Convert DEC, EXP, REF threads into markdown artifacts. Push TASK threads to task manager with the short ID in title. Photograph cards and boards to /_inbox.
- Link new artifacts back by writing full IDs into the workbook margins.

  

Weekly, 60 minutes

- Merge duplicates.
- Update maps with five new links.
- Review decision records set for review. Reverse if metrics miss.
- Cull. Delete two weak notes. Archive stale experiments.

  

Monthly, 45 minutes

- Audit metrics below.
- Tighten closed tag list.
- Promote "applied" notes that drove outcomes.

  

# Operating constraints

- Hard cap of 12 workbook threads per day. If you exceed, you are journaling, not routing.
- Hard cap of 10 kept notes per chapter or per hour of source material.
- Encode latency under 48 hours. Anything older returns to /_inbox for deletion.
- For every five notes created, schedule one experiment or play.
- Quote density under 10 percent. Paraphrase for cognition.

  

# Metrics that keep it accountable

- Encode latency. Median hours from workbook thread to markdown artifact. Target under 24.
- Action ratio. Plays executed divided by plays created. Target 60 percent or more.
- Retrieval time. Time to find three relevant notes for a live decision. Target under 2 minutes.
- Decision follow-up. Percent of decisions with a review logged on time. Target 90 percent.
- Vault bloat. Percent of notes untouched in 60 days. Target 20 to 40.
- Card loss rate. Cards captured but missing at sweep. Target under 2 percent.

  

# Failure modes and fixes

- Workbook turns into a diary. Fix: enforce daily thread cap; every thread must route to a decision, experiment, note, or task.
- Fragmentation across media. Fix: stable IDs and a daily sweep. Everything gets an ID or gets culled.
- Tag sprawl. Fix: closed vocabulary in /maps/_tags.md. Prefer explicit links.
- Scanning drag. Fix: photograph; never beautify. Type only the highest-signal items.
- Decision amnesia. Fix: ADR-like decision records with review dates baked in.

  

# Minimal kit

  

Workbook you already use. Pocket sleeve with 20 blanks and 10 active cards. Pen that dries fast. Slip box with five Leitner slots. Plain-text editor. Git repo for the vault. One phone shortcut that saves photos straight to /_inbox with timestamp filenames.

  

# Three-day implementation

  

Day 1. Create vault folders and templates. Add closed tag list. Write today's workbook threads using the grammar.

Day 2. Run the first sweep. Produce one decision record, one experiment spec, three atomic notes, one map update.

Day 3. Execute the experiment. Record outcomes. Review metrics.

  

If you want the folder skeleton and all templates as ready-to-use markdown files with your IDs prefilled, say so and I will generate them now.
