*Correction of your request: "Could you provide comprehensive recommendations for selecting optimal date-time formats across titles, YAML, and changelogs?"*

---

### **Key Considerations:**
- **Title:** Should remain compact, unique, and consistently sortable.
- **YAML Metadata:** Must be machine-readable and optimally structured for automation and filtering.
- **Changelog:** Should prioritize human readability, intuitive review, and minimal clutter.

Given these parameters, I recommend a **cohesive yet differentiated structure** as follows:

---

### **1. For Titles: Maintain Your Current Compact Format**
**Format:** `YYYYMMDDTHHmmss` (e.g., `20250125T055232`)

- **Why keep this format?**
  - Guarantees **uniqueness** for each note or file.
  - Highly **sortable** within file systems or directories without relying on additional metadata.
  - Compact, clean, and universally **consistent**.
  - Readily **parsable** if you ever need to automate naming conventions.

- **No changes recommended:** Your current format is highly effective and adheres to best practices.

---

### **2. For YAML Metadata: Use ISO 8601**
**Format:** `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm` (e.g., `2025-01-25T05:52:32+01:00`)

- **Why ISO 8601?**
  - Universally recognized and **machine-friendly** (perfect for querying, parsing, or automation).
  - Works across **YAML parsers**, Obsidian plugins, and any external tools you might use.
  - **Time zone offsets** (e.g., `+01:00`) are integrated into the format without adding visual clutter.
  
- **Example YAML Metadata:**
  ```yaml
  created: 2025-01-25T05:52:32+01:00
  modified: 2025-01-29T12:45:00+01:00
  archived: 2025-02-15T14:03:10+01:00
  ```

- **Recommended structure for YAML section:**
  - **`created` and `modified` keys:** Log critical timestamps.
  - **Use `archived` only if you need structured archival status.**  
  (Otherwise, use the changelog for less critical timestamp events.)

---

### **3. For the Changelog: Adopt a Cleaner, Human-Readable Format**
**Format:** `Weekday, DD Mon YYYY, HH:mm:ss (optional timezone)`  
(e.g., `Saturday, 25 Jan 2025, 05:52:32`)

- **Why this format?**
  - Intuitive and highly **scannable for human review**.
  - Compact enough to avoid clutter but still precise (including seconds).
  - Abbreviating the month (`Jan` instead of `January`) strikes the balance between readability and brevity.
  - **Omit time zones unless necessary** (UTC offsets can be verbose and are already in YAML).

- **Example changelog entry:**  
  ```
  [Saturday, 25 Jan 2025, 05:52:32] Archived the note.
  [Monday, 29 Jan 2025, 12:45:00] Added reference section.
  ```

- **Why not include full weekday/month names like before?**
  - Avoids unnecessary verbosity (helps with long changelogs).
  - Short formats are still recognizable without sacrificing clarity.

### **Final Overview of Recommendations**
| Context      | Purpose                         | Recommended Format                                   | Example                                  |
|--------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Title**     | Compact, unique identifier      | `YYYYMMDDTHHmmss`                                   | `20250125T055232`                        |
| **YAML**      | Machine-readable metadata       | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm` (ISO 8601)              | `2025-01-25T05:52:32+01:00`              |
| **Changelog** | Human-readable event tracking   | `Weekday, DD Mon YYYY, HH:mm:ss`                    | `[Saturday, 25 Jan 2025, 05:52:32]`      |

### **Why This Setup Works:**
1. **Non-redundant usage:** Each format serves its distinct purpose without overlap.
2. **Unified structure:** All date formats maintain chronological consistency (YYYY-MM-DD).
3. **Scalability:** Future scripts, automations, or even manual reviews will remain intuitive and efficient.

Let me know if you foresee any edge cases or additional customization needs for this structure.
