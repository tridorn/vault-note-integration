Harvesting is taking notes of sources. Harvesting means creating a notes file on a specific book, a specific article, a specific lecture in date/time

Structuring brings order into the harvest for myself

Synthesis derives results for me

**In other words, I can never paste something written by someone else into Obsidian. I can never directly take notes in Obsidian!**
