title: why enums? a rational take
---

love the question. yes--you're seeing a lot of "enums." that's intentional. here's the full, practical playbook for a unified dual‑purpose system with a clear stance on when to use enums vs. new keys, plus ready‑to‑paste templates and dataview render snippets.

  

# why enums? a rational take

  

goal: one schema that fits every note without exploding into dozens of type‑specific keys.

  

strategy: keep the shape stable (same blocks & fields everywhere) and specialize with constrained values (enums) where variety exists.

  

benefits

- queryability: dashboards stay simple (WHERE state.stage = "review").
- interoperability: fewer unique keys to remember; same queries work across book, paper, project.
- evolution: you can add enum values without breaking templates (vs. inventing new keys).
- consistency: avoids synonyms (phase vs stage, source vs reference).

  

costs / trade‑offs

- expressiveness: enums are coarse; sometimes you'll want a richer structure.
- migration: changing enum vocab later needs a pass across notes.
- discoverability: users must know the allowed values (solve with a reference block below).

  

rule of thumb

- If variation is categorical (finite, stable), use an enum value (e.g., materials.items[].kind).
- If variation is structured (nested fields, arbitrary shapes), use a new object key.
- If variation is free‑text meaning (explanations), put it in the body.

how enums reduce keys: notice how type, content.mode, claims.items[].kind, artifacts.items[].kind, state.stage, state.status, state.priority encode role and lifecycle without spawning new sections.

# when to

# not

#  use enums (add structure instead)

- You need per‑type fields with semantics (e.g., for a paper: journal, volume, issue, pages).

→ Add a targeted object alongside enums, without changing the schema shape:
    
    
    identity:
      # ...
      type: paper
    bibliography:
      journal: ""
      year: 0
      volume: ""
      issue: ""
      pages: ""
      doi: ""

This keeps queries universal (shape unchanged) while allowing rich metadata where it matters.

* * *

# reference: enum vocab (keep this in a pinned note)
    
    
    vocab:
      type:        [note, book, paper, project, concept, meeting, experiment]
      content_mode:[summary, analysis, draft, build, notes]
      claim_kind:  [finding, insight, decision, hypothesis, quote_thesis]
      artifact_kind:[file, figure, table, deliverable, highlight]
      stage:       [capture, clarify, compose, review, publish, archive]
      status:      [open, blocked, waiting, done, n/a]
      priority:    [low, normal, high, urgent]

tip: version this (vocab.version: 1) so future changes can be migrated intentionally.

same shape, different values.

# governance & evolution

  

1) version your schema
    
    
    schema:
      name: "universal-dual"
      version: 1

bump the version when you add/change enum values or add structured blocks (bibliography, ethics, etc.).

  

2) soft‑validation in obsidian

- use dataview to flag non‑enum values:
    
    
    TABLE WITHOUT ID
    choice(identity.type, "✔️", "⚠️ invalid type: " + identity.type) AS TypeCheck
    WHERE file.name = this.file.name

3) migrations

- keep a migrations.md with search/replace steps (e.g., status: in_progress → status: open).

  

4) defaults

- keep empty blocks present; dashboards remain universal and queries don't need existence checks.

# bottom line

- yes, enums are a core strategy here--they let one schema cover many note types without spawning unique keys.
- use structured sub‑objects when a domain truly needs them (bibliography, ethics, methods), without changing the outer shape.
- keep meaning in the body, facts in meta, and mirror only what helps reading.

  

if you want, I can package this as an obsidian template with the dataview snippets embedded and a "vocab reference" note so you can autocomplete valid values.
