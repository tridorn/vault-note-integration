Your request might be better expressed as: *"I would like a clear delineation of which types of notes or items should be allocated to Drafts, Obsidian, and my physical system, given their respective purposes and strengths."*

Here is a refined delineation of item types for your tools based on their purpose and your described workflows:

---

### **1. Drafts (Quick Capture & Fleeting Notes)**
Drafts is ideal for transient, raw, or undeveloped thoughts that require minimal friction to capture. Its strength lies in its accessibility and immediacy.

**Items to place in Drafts:**
- Sudden ideas or thoughts that occur during other tasks (e.g., "Add Stoic maxim to Anki").
- Meeting notes or spontaneous to-do lists you’ll process later.
- Incomplete thoughts, observations, or mind dumps for later refinement (e.g., "Research AMU teamspace structures").
- Draft versions of emails, messages, or short-form writing.
- Notes you don’t yet know where to classify but want to record.

**Workflow:**  
Regularly process notes from Drafts to their more permanent locations (Obsidian, physical notebooks, or task systems). If an item is actionable, delegate it directly to your task manager.

---

### **2. Obsidian (Formalized Knowledge System)**  
Obsidian excels as a repository for structured, long-term knowledge, offering relational insights through its graph and linking features.

**Items to place in Obsidian:**
- Formalized knowledge, such as research summaries, concepts, frameworks, and methodologies (e.g., "AMU-based organizational structure").
- Personal insights, reflections, and refined thoughts (e.g., "Reflection on meeting with AKB team").
- Aggregated learnings from books, articles, or courses (e.g., "Notes on 'Meditations' by Marcus Aurelius").
- Project documentation (e.g., plans for Ben Dyk, cultural initiatives).
- Templates and standardized workflows (e.g., templates for Stoic maxims).
- Links between related ideas, projects, or systems (Obsidian’s linking feature allows cross-referencing).

**Workflow:**  
Only input well-thought-out or refined ideas. Use Drafts or your physical system for initial ideation or brainstorming, then synthesize those outputs into cohesive entries for Obsidian.

---

### **3. Physical System (Tactile Ideation & Creative Thinking)**  
Your physical system serves as an intuitive, spatially engaging medium for brainstorming, designing, or engaging more deeply with concepts.

**Items to place in your physical system:**
- Visualizations of ideas or frameworks (e.g., sketches of workflows or diagrams for the Ben Dyk website).
- Mind maps or nonlinear notes for creative problem-solving.
- Ideation exercises or freewriting sessions (e.g., "What would a Stoic-driven company culture look like?").
- Planning and prioritizing tasks or projects in a physical, spread-out space.
- Experimental notes that require interaction and revision (e.g., physical storyboards for 'university lore' projects).

**Workflow:**  
Use this system for discovery and ideation. Once ideas are refined or stable, transfer their outcomes into Obsidian or implement them directly.

### **Example Allocation for Notes**
1. **A sudden idea for a new AMU mission:**  
   - **Drafts**: Capture the raw idea.  
   - Later, transfer to **Obsidian** as part of the AMU Mission Book or related documentation.  
   - Use your **physical system** for mapping out the mission phases.

2. **Meeting notes from AKB IT brainstorming session:**  
   - **Drafts**: Record key takeaways during the meeting.  
   - Later, process and store actionable decisions in a **task manager** and summaries in **Obsidian**.

3. **New concept for the Ben Dyk website layout:**  
   - Start with a **physical notebook** to sketch ideas and brainstorm visually.  
   - Once finalized, formalize the concept in **Obsidian** for documentation.

---

### **Guidelines for Clarity**
1. **Drafts for speed, Physical for exploration, Obsidian for permanence.**
2. Regularly review and process items in Drafts and your physical system to ensure nothing gets lost or remains unorganized.
3. Use the **two-minute rule**: if an item can be processed and stored correctly in its destination quickly, do so directly instead of using Drafts.
