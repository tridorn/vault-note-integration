Certainly! To formalize your note-taking system and provide **specific names** and **clear definitions** for the phases, processes, and components, I’ve developed a structured terminology. This will make your framework precise, scalable, and universally applicable.

---

### **Formalized Terminology for the Note-Taking Framework**

#### **1. Phases of the Note-Taking System**

The process is divided into three distinct **phases**, each with its own focus and purpose.

1. **Harvesting**  
	- **Definition:** The initial phase where raw input is gathered from various sources, such as books, lectures, brainstorming, or prior notes.
	- **Purpose:** To collect raw material and identify initial themes or questions for exploration.
	- **Key Actions:** 
	  - Survey the source (skim, scan, or brainstorm).
	  - Highlight key points or interesting ideas.
	  - Annotate with initial impressions or questions.

2. **Structuring**  
	- **Definition:** The phase where raw material is organized into a cohesive format (e.g., using the Cornell system). Ideas are captured, contextualized, and prepared for further refinement.
	- **Purpose:** To organize the input into structured notes with clear objectives and summaries.
	- **Key Actions:**
	  - Use a formal structure (e.g., Cornell Method).
	  - Refine Objectives (Purpose, Goals, Key Questions).
	  - Capture key points, reflections, and summaries.

3. **Synthesizing**  
	- **Definition:** The phase where structured notes are transformed into **atomic conceptual notes**, using the Input → Process → Output framework.
	- **Purpose:** To distill structured notes into self-contained, actionable knowledge blocks that can be reused and interconnected.
	- **Key Actions:**
	  - Isolate atomic concepts.
	  - Apply the IPO framework to create conceptual notes.
	  - Link notes to related ideas for long-term use.

#### **2. Processes Within Each Phase**

Each phase contains **processes**—specific activities that help achieve the purpose of the phase.

##### **Harvesting Phase Processes**

- **Source Identification**: Determine what material you need to engage with (e.g., book, article, lecture, brainstorming session).
- **Raw Extraction**: Highlight, annotate, or summarize initial impressions from the source.
- **Theme Identification**: Identify recurring themes, key ideas, or questions to explore further.

##### **Structuring Phase Processes**

- **Contextualization**: Organize raw material into a structured format, adding Purpose, Goals, and Key Questions.
- **Note Framing**: Use a systematic approach (e.g., Cornell Method) to frame the material into:
  - **Main Notes:** Detailed points or summaries.
  - **Cue Column:** Keywords or guiding prompts.
  - **Summary Section:** A synthesis of the material.
- **Initial Reflection**: Add personal insights or connections to other ideas.

##### **Synthesizing Phase Processes**

- **Atomic Breakdown**: Break structured notes into atomic topics, each focusing on a single concept.
- **IPO Application**: Use the Input → Process → Output framework to create conceptual notes.
- **Interlinking**: Connect atomic notes to other concepts, building a web of interrelated knowledge.

#### **3. Key Components of the Framework**

Each phase and process interacts with **core components** that remain consistent throughout the system. Here’s how to define and name these components:

1. **Objectives (Guiding Framework)**
	- Purpose: The overarching reason for engaging with the material.
	- Goals: Specific, measurable outcomes you want to achieve.
	- Key Questions: Targeted inquiries guiding your exploration.

2. **Harvest Notes**
	- **Definition:** Raw, unstructured material gathered during the Harvesting phase.  
	- **Content:** Highlights, annotations, initial impressions, or direct quotes from the source.
	- **Purpose:** To serve as the foundation for structured notes.

3. **Structured Notes**
	- **Definition:** Notes organized using a formal method (e.g., Cornell system) during the Structuring phase.  
	- **Content:** A blend of input (main points), reflections (cue column), and summaries.  
	- **Purpose:** To create a cohesive representation of the material for further synthesis.

4. **Conceptual Notes**
	- **Definition:** Self-contained, atomic notes created in the Synthesizing phase using the Input → Process → Output framework.  
	- **Content:** Focus on a single idea, including its summary (Input), analysis (Process), and actionable insights (Output).  
	- **Purpose:** To distill knowledge into reusable, linkable blocks.

5. **Knowledge Network**
	- **Definition:** The interconnected system of conceptual notes that grows as new material is synthesized and linked.  
	- **Purpose:** To facilitate long-term understanding and integration of knowledge across domains.

### **Applying The Formalized Framework**

#### **Workflow Using the New Terminology**

1. **Harvesting Phase**:
	- Engage with the **source** (book, lecture, brainstorming).
	- Perform **Raw Extraction** of key points, highlights, or quotes.
	- Identify **Themes** and questions for exploration.

2. **Structuring Phase**:
	- Organize **Harvest Notes** into **Structured Notes** using the Cornell system or similar.
	- Clearly define **Objectives** (Purpose, Goals, Key Questions).
	- Add reflections and summaries to contextualize the material.

3. **Synthesizing Phase**:
	- Break down **Structured Notes** into **Atomic Concepts**.
	- Create **Conceptual Notes** using the **IPO Framework**.
	- Interlink these notes to build a **Knowledge Network**.

- **Raw Extraction:** Highlight: “The Pomodoro Technique uses 25-minute focus intervals.”
- **Theme Identification:** Time Management Techniques, Productivity Tools.

#### **Phase 2: Structuring**

- **Structured Notes:**
  - **Cue Column:** Keywords: "Pomodoro Technique," "Focus."
  - **Main Notes:** Details of the Pomodoro Technique.
  - **Summary:** “The Pomodoro Technique improves focus by breaking work into intervals.”

#### **Phase 3: Synthesizing**

- **Conceptual Note:**
  - **Title:** "Pomodoro Technique"
  - **Input:** “A time management method using 25-minute intervals.”
  - **Process:** Reflection on when and how it’s most effective.
  - **Output:** Plan to implement it for daily work sessions.

### **Final Thoughts**

By defining each phase, process, and component with specific terminology, this framework becomes:
1. **Comprehensive:** Covers the entire lifecycle of note-taking, from raw input to actionable insights.
2. **Modular:** Each part (e.g., Harvest Notes, Conceptual Notes) is distinct and reusable.
3. **Scalable:** Can handle simple topics or complex projects with equal efficiency.
