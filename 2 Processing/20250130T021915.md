Certainly. To elaborate on the proposed color-coding system, let us delineate the application of each hue with enhanced granularity, employing it to foster an efficacious and methodical approach to annotating texts:

1. **Yellow**: Use this luminescent shade to underline or bracket primary assertions and theses that are central to each chapter or section. It is beneficial to apply yellow to headings, subheadings, and any declarative statements that encapsulate pivotal arguments or expositions.
2. **Green**: This verdant color should be dedicated to encapsulating definitions and key terms. When a new concept is introduced, highlight the term itself in green, along with its definition. This practice creates a visual glossary within your text, making it simpler to locate and review technical vocabulary or specialized jargon.
3. **Blue**: Assign the serene and stable blue to empirical data, statistical information, or historical dates. This color aids in segregating factual data from theoretical or interpretive text, thereby facilitating quick retrieval of empirical evidence or examples that substantiate the narrative or argumentation of the book.
4. **Pink**: Utilize pink for insights that require inferential thinking or subjective interpretation. This may include implications of theories, critiques of the author's arguments, or personal reflections on the material. Pink highlights can serve as cues for points where you engaged deeply with the text, offering a personal touchstone for later reflection or discussion.
5. **Purple**: Reserve this regal shade for annotating queries, ambiguities, or disagreements with the text. Whenever a passage provokes a question or leaves room for doubt, marking it in purple can denote areas requiring further investigation or consultation with additional sources.

This detailed application of each color not only aids in segmenting the text into easily digestible elements but also enhances your interactive engagement with the material, thereby enriching the learning and review process.
