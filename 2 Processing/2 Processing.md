# Processing

## General 

- Files in this stage are actively being worked on.
- Primary aim is to reduce the length of the file.

## Workflow

1. Insertion of [[Processing Prompt]] at the bottom of the note
2. Copy all (faster to. Including the metadata like this doesn't appear to affect output quality)
3. New ChatGPT temporary chat with GPT-5-instant, link in the bookmark toolbar for easy access
4. Paste into ChatGPT
5. Copy all of ChatGPT output (one-shot)
6. Paste into text editor (a direct paste into Obsidian fucks up formatting)
7. Stripping of intro and outro
8. Paste of the summary into Obsidian (into the same file, replacing the original content completely)

> [!note]
> The aim is to get a significant reduction of volume, cutting all the bloat and semantics while retaining the logical core. Replacing the original with the summary (instead of say, archiving original, creating new note for summary), is deemed necessary based on the sheer scope of content (1,700,000w, 3100n)
