To handle newsletters or any non-urgent emails that you want to read later in the day, you can create a specific workflow within your email folder structure that accommodates this need. Here's how you can manage such emails efficiently:

### Adding a "Read Later" Folder

#### Main Folders

1. **Inbox**: For all new, unread emails.
2. **Action Required**: For emails that require your immediate attention or action.
3. **Waiting For**: For emails that you are waiting for a response or further action from someone else.
4. **Read Later**: For newsletters, articles, and non-urgent emails you want to read later.
5. **Archive**: For emails that you have dealt with and want to keep for future reference.

#### Subfolders Under "Read Later"

- **Read Later Today**: For newsletters and non-urgent emails you plan to read the same day.
- **Read Later This Week**: For non-urgent emails you plan to read within the week.
- **Read Later This Month**: For less urgent emails you want to get to at some point.

### Workflow for Handling Newsletters

1. **Receive Newsletter**:
	- The newsletter arrives in your **Inbox**.

2. **Categorize for Later Reading**:
	- If you plan to read it later the same day, move it to **Read Later > Read Later Today**.
	- If you plan to read it later in the week, move it to **Read Later > Read Later This Week**.
	- If it's less urgent and you'll read it when you have time, move it to **Read Later > Read Later This Month**.

3. **Daily Routine**:
	- At a designated time each day (e.g., during a break or at the end of the workday), review the **Read Later Today** folder.
	- Move emails from **Read Later Today** to **Archive** or relevant folders after reading.

4. **Weekly Routine**:
	- At a designated time each week (e.g., Friday afternoon), review the **Read Later This Week** folder.
	- Move emails from **Read Later This Week** to **Archive** or relevant folders after reading.

5. **Monthly Routine**:
	- At a designated time each month (e.g., the last day of the month), review the **Read Later This Month** folder.
	- Move emails from **Read Later This Month** to **Archive** or relevant folders after reading.

### Example Workflow Scenario

**Scenario**: You receive a newsletter from a professional organization.

1. **Step 1**: The newsletter arrives in your **Inbox**.
2. **Step 2**: Since you plan to read it later today, move it to **Read Later > Read Later Today**.
3. **Step 3**: During your afternoon break, open the **Read Later > Read Later Today** folder and read the newsletter.
4. **Step 4**: After reading, move the newsletter to **Archive > Subscriptions** for future reference.
