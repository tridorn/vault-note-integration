When considering whether to frame your note headings as questions, a useful rule of thumb involves assessing the goal of your notes, the nature of the information, and how you intend to use the notes later. Here's a simple guideline to help you decide:

# Use Questions When

1. **Your Goal is Understanding or Exploration:**
	- If the primary purpose of your notes is to deepen your understanding of a topic, framing headings as questions can prompt you to think critically and explore the material more thoroughly.

2. **You Need to Review or Study the Material:**
	- When preparing for exams or needing to recall information, questions can serve as effective cues for active recall, making your study sessions more efficient.

3. **The Material is Complex and Requires Breaking Down:**
	- For complex topics, questions can help you dissect the material into more manageable parts, facilitating a clearer understanding.

4. **You Are Engaging in Research or Problem-Solving:**
	- When researching new topics or solving problems, questions can guide your exploration and ensure you cover all relevant aspects.

# Avoid Questions When

1. **You Are Capturing Information Quickly:**
	- In situations where speed is essential, such as live lectures or meetings, sticking to short, descriptive headings might be more efficient.

2. **The Information is Descriptive or Narrative:**
	- For topics that involve storytelling, chronological events, or descriptive content, traditional headings might better serve the clarity and flow of your notes.

3. **The Content Doesn't Lend Itself to Inquiry:**
	- If the material is straightforward, factual, or procedural (like instructions or guidelines), questions might add unnecessary complexity.

# Rule of Thumb

- **Apply the "Purpose and Context Test":** Before deciding on your heading style, ask yourself, "Will framing this as a question enhance my understanding, recall, or engagement with the material?" If the answer is yes, and it fits the context of your note-taking scenario, then questions are likely a beneficial approach. Conversely, if the material is straightforward, or you're in a rush, it might be best to stick with traditional headings.
- **Balance Is Key:** Remember, you don't have to stick exclusively to one style. Mixing question-based headings with traditional ones based on the content and purpose can offer the best of both worlds, tailoring your notes to serve your specific needs effectively.

Adapting your approach based on the material and your objectives will help you create more effective, useful notes, whether you're studying, researching, or capturing information for future reference.
