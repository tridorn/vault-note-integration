This folder structure is designed to be **adaptable** across a range of project types and timeframes, from short-term development efforts to long-term, evolving projects like websites that are updated over extended periods. Below is a clearer delineation of its intended use, when to apply it, and how it can be adapted for ongoing projects:

### **1. When to Use This Folder Structure**

This structure is primarily suited for projects that:

- Require **organized, accessible documentation** for both technical and non-technical team members.
- Have a mix of **text-based content, technical documentation, and assets**.
- Involve **multiple phases** of development or evolution, such as research, planning, design, development, and post-launch maintenance.
- Need a **central source of truth** (like your Master Content file) to maintain consistency across all outputs.
- Require a balance between **process-based** and **content-based** documentation.

#### **Use Cases**

- **Software Projects**: Where different components (frontend, backend, APIs) are developed in parallel or phases (e.g., agile sprints), and require robust documentation for architecture, testing, and deployment.
- **Creative and Content Projects**: Where content (e.g., writing, design) needs structured guides and workflows, with assets and references stored separately.
- **Long-Term Projects (Websites, Products)**: Where the project will evolve over time and requires clear documentation for initial development, continuous updates, and maintenance.

### **2. When to Set Up This Structure (New Vs. Existing Projects)**

#### **For New Projects**

- **Early Stage Setup**: This structure is particularly effective when set up from the very beginning of a project. The `/overview` and `/process` sections help document initial planning, vision, and goals, while `/components` and `/guides` provide places to document specific features or elements as they are developed.
- **Pre-launch Documentation**: It can evolve organically as the project progresses from planning through to launch, with different sections filled in during each phase. This makes it highly adaptive to projects where you don't know all the final requirements from the outset.

#### **For Existing Projects**

- **Retrofitting Documentation**: If you're adopting this structure mid-project, start by focusing on the most critical areas (e.g., `/components` to document features, `/process` for workflows). You can gradually build out other sections like `/guides` and `/overview` over time as needed.
- **Archiving Old Materials**: Use the `/archive` folder to store outdated or previously used documentation so you don’t lose valuable insights from earlier versions of the project.

### **3. Long-Term, Evolving Projects (e.g., Websites)**

This structure works well for **long-term projects** like websites, where content, features, and design are updated regularly over time. Here’s how it can be adapted for such projects:

#### **Ongoing Website Development**

1. **Initial Setup**: In the early phases of website creation, use this structure to document the design, architecture, and feature development of the website.
	 - **/overview**: Vision, goals, and the overall website strategy.
	 - **/process**: Design and development workflows (e.g., wireframes, UI/UX decisions).
	 - **/components**: Each key section of the website (e.g., homepage, user authentication, contact forms) can have its own subfolder with documentation on architecture, implementation, and testing.

2. **Long-Term Updates**: For websites, updates can happen frequently and over long periods, so this structure remains relevant by documenting each phase of updates and changes.
	 - **/process**: Every time there’s a significant update (e.g., redesign, new feature), you can document the new workflows here, and older versions can move to the `/archive` folder.
	 - **/components**: As new features are added or old ones are updated, the `/components` folder will continue to house documentation for each part of the site. For example, new pages or modules (e.g., blog sections, e-commerce sections) can be treated as new components.
	 - **/maintenance**: Regular updates and long-term support can be documented here, tracking bug fixes, content updates, and technical maintenance.

3. **Version Control for Long-Term Projects**: 
	 - Long-term projects may have multiple **versions** or major iterations. Each major version can have its own section in `/process` (e.g., `/process/version1`, `/process/version2`).
	 - Use **Git** to maintain a full history of changes across all documentation and code so that the evolution of the website is clearly tracked. You can tag releases or versions in Git to map major changes.

4. **Continuous Improvement**:
	 - Use the `/meetings` folder to track discussions and decisions about future iterations of the website.
	 - Feedback from users and performance metrics can be incorporated into the `/process` or `/components` folder to ensure documentation remains relevant.

### **4. Incorporating Different Project Types**

This structure is also flexible enough to work for non-software projects or content-driven projects (such as blog creation or product marketing):

#### **For Marketing Campaigns or Content Production**

- **/overview**: Include vision, goals, and strategic direction for the campaign.
- **/guides**: Develop style guides, content writing guides, and design principles for consistency across marketing materials.
- **/components**: Break down campaign elements (e.g., email campaigns, social media strategies) into components and document how each will be executed.
- **/process**: Document the overall campaign process, from planning to content creation to launch.

#### **For Research or Consulting Projects**

- **/overview**: Project goals and research objectives.
- **/guides**: Methodology guides or instructions for team members working on data collection.
- **/reference**: Literature reviews, technical references, or previous research findings.
- **/process**: Track how the research project unfolds over time, from data gathering to analysis to final reporting.

### **Final Considerations**

- **When to Set Up a New Structure**: A new project should have this structure in place from the beginning, even if not all sections are immediately filled out. This way, as the project progresses, you’ll have a clear organizational system to track documentation across multiple phases.
  
- **Long-Term Projects**: For ongoing projects like websites, this structure provides a way to track continuous updates while maintaining clarity on what’s been done and what’s planned. Using `/process` for major updates and `/components` for each feature ensures that your documentation scales as the project grows.

- **Short-Term Projects**: For shorter projects, the structure may not need to be as comprehensive. You might omit certain folders (e.g., `/archive`, `/maintenance`) and keep the focus on core elements like `/overview`, `/components`, and `/guides`.

This folder structure, while flexible enough for evolving projects, ensures that even long-term, continuously updated projects remain well-documented, organized, and easy to navigate for both technical and non-technical team members.
