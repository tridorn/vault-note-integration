To fully document the **note-taking system**, you should create a series of **concept notes** that capture each aspect of the framework, breaking it into self-contained, atomic notes. These notes should collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the system while remaining modular and interconnectable.

Below is an **overview of all the concept notes** you should create, categorized by phase, process, and component, along with suggestions for how to structure each note.

### **Suggested Workflow for Creating These Notes**

1. **Start with Core Notes**:
	- Define the overarching purpose, phases, and components.

2. **Add Phase Notes**:
	- Document each phase (Harvesting, Structuring, Synthesizing) in detail.

3. **Expand with Process Notes**:
	- Break down each phase into its specific processes.

4. **Include Component Notes**:
	- Detail the core building blocks (e.g., Structured Notes, Atomic Notes).

5. **Integrate Application Notes**:
	- Address how the system adapts to various contexts and scales over time.

### **Final Thoughts**

These concept notes will act as a **living documentation** of your note-taking system, enabling you to:
- **Refine and iterate** the system as you experiment with it.
- **Teach or share** the system with others.
- **Scale effectively** as your knowledge network grows.
