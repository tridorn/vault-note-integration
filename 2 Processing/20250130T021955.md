# Taking Notes of Lectures in Note-Taking System

## Process

1. **Before the lecture**: If you have access to the lecture's syllabus or agenda in advance, skim through it to get an overview of the topics that will be covered. Make a note of any key concepts or topics.

2. **During the lecture**: Take active notes, jotting down key points, concepts, examples, and any questions or thoughts that come up. If you're dealing with a recorded lecture or a transcript, you could potentially use AI tools to help transcribe or summarize the content.

3. **After the lecture**: Review your notes and begin to structure them according to the note-taking structure I suggested. This is where AI can be a big help. You could feed your raw notes into an AI like ChatGPT, asking it to generate a structured summary based on the notes. It's important to remember that AI tools aren't perfect, so you should always review and edit the AI-generated summaries to ensure accuracy and coherence.

4. **Creating lecture notes in Obsidian**: Transfer your well-structured notes into Obsidian, creating a new note for each lecture. Add the appropriate metadata (including relation data), and link to any related notes in your Zettelkasten.

5. **Concept-level notes**: If there were important concepts covered in the lecture, create separate, atomic concept notes in Obsidian. Again, you could potentially use AI to help generate first drafts of these notes based on your raw lecture notes.

6. **Review and revise**: Review your notes periodically and update them as necessary. This will help consolidate your understanding and make your Zettelkasten a living knowledge system.
