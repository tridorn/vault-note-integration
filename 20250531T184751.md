Refined phrasing: _"Summarise the optimal actions to undertake during idle periods at cultural events to maintain strategic presence and extract value."_

### **Pre-Performance (Arrival Window)**

- Position near informational or social density (programme tables, sponsor booths).
- Stand or sit upright, composed, no phone. Programme in hand optional.
- Survey audience demography and behavioural patterns--register who leads, who watches.
- Mentally recalibrate: recall context of the play, set observational intent.

### **Intermission**

- Relocate with intent--walk one visible arc through high-traffic areas.
- Anchor near a semi-public structure (statue, window, display) if not in dialogue.
- Observe audience reactions, overhear thematic discussions if in proximity.
- If alone: note 2--3 sharp observations from Act I.
- If with others: prompt focused discussion (avoid summarising or platitudes).

### **At All Times**

- No idle scrolling.
- No aimless wandering.
- Posture must signal intent, not waiting.
- Eyes up. You are an observer, not a participant in logistical flow.

**Purpose**: Signal presence, absorb secondary data, maintain interpretive continuity. Let your behaviour suggest you belong--and choose to be alone.
