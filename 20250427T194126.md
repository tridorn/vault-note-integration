### 1‚ÄÇ|‚ÄÇHow ‚Äúhard‚Äù is a ‚Ç¨1 m European seed round?  
- **Typical cheque sizes:** ‚Ç¨500 k ‚Äì ‚Ç¨3 m for climate / fintech pre-seed & seed rounds in Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm, London.  
- **Deal volume:** >1 000 such rounds closed in the EU-27 + UK in 2024 (PitchBook).  
- **Hit-rate rule-of-thumb:** ~1 pitch deck in 30 gets a term-sheet at seed; you dramatically increase odds when you tick the ‚Äútrust signals‚Äù investors screen for (see below).

> **Conclusion:** A ‚Ç¨1 m seed is rationally achievable if you show *institution-grade* readiness on the six signals below.

## 2‚ÄÇ|‚ÄÇThe Six ‚ÄúTrust Signals‚Äù Every EU Seed Investor Screens For

| # | Signal | What it really means | Practical artefacts you must show |

## 3‚ÄÇ|‚ÄÇMaking Veridian ‚ÄúInstitution-Grade‚Äù in 60 Days

> **Objective:** walk into investor calls with a *data room* that makes DD friction-less.

### ‚ù∂‚ÄÇCorporate hygiene  
1. **HoldCo formation** (if not done): Delaware C-Corp or UK Ltd with 10 m common shares.  
2. **Subsidiary UG**: shareholder agreement, Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer appointed, tax # issued.  
3. **Founder docs**: PIIA, 4-yr vesting, board consent for 15 % ESOP.

### ‚ù∑‚ÄÇPilot artefacts  
- Pilot charter (4 bullets: scope, success KPIs, go/no-go date, data-sharing).  
- Kick-off calendar invite + list of named ProCredit counterparties.  
- Airtable/Notion ‚ÄúPilot dashboard‚Äù updated weekly.

### ‚ù∏‚ÄÇTraction artefacts  
- Vendor MoUs (at least 5; each states fee % after pilot).  
- Screenshot of live SME portal with ‚â•3 demo applications.  
- One external testimonial (vendor or SME quote).

### ‚ùπ‚ÄÇReg-tech memo  
- 2-page letter from a recognised German fintech law firm: ‚ÄúVeridian acts as loan broker (¬ß34c GewO), no BaFin licence required; money-laundering obligations handled by partner bank.‚Äù

### ‚ù∫‚ÄÇFinancial pack  
- 18-month cash-flow model (Excel, three scenarios).  
- Unit-economics sheet (customer cohort, fee %, cost to acquire vendor + SME).

## 4‚ÄÇ|‚ÄÇInvestor Targeting & Sequencing

| Week | Activity | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Warm-intro crawl (LinkedIn founders of Planet A, Extantia, Seedcamp climate lead) | 10 pre-qualified investor calls booked |
| 2 | Send ‚Äúteaser‚Äù (1-page) + short Loom of prototype | Gauge interest; invite into full data room |
| 3-4 | Run 30-minute calls (problem ‚ûü solution ‚ûü pilot ‚ûü traction ‚ûü ask) | 3‚Äì4 soft-circle commitments |
| 5 | Term-sheet negotiation with preferred lead (100‚Äì300 k ticket) | 30 day exclusivity |
| 6 | Close remaining ‚Ç¨700‚Äì900 k with angels/ climate syndicates | Round hits ‚Ç¨1 m target |
| 7 | File equity paperwork, start wiring, issue SAFEs if needed | Money in bank <60 days |

*Tip:* climate-impact angels (ex-Northvolt, ex-Klarna) can close cheques in under 2 weeks; keep 20‚Äì30 % of round for fast angel top-ups.

## 5‚ÄÇ|‚ÄÇReality-Check: Why Investors Will Say Yes

1. **Decarbonisation Megatrend** ‚Äì EU Green Deal allocates ‚Ç¨1 tn; SME piece is largely untapped (EBA: <5 % of total loans are ‚Äúgreen‚Äù).  
2. **Clear Initial KPI** ‚Äì Pilot with ProCredit shows underwriting time ‚Üì 40 %, loans ‚Üë X.  
3. **Repeatable Playbook** ‚Äì Same wizard plugs into any Tier-2 bank in SEE/Central Europe.  
4. **Stacked Monetisation** ‚Äì Vendor fee now, SaaS next, embedded spread later.  
5. **Eyes-open Risk Plan** ‚Äì Legal memo + roadmap to lending licence demonstrates maturity.

If you hit the six trust signals, a ‚Ç¨1 m seed in Europe is **not ambitious‚Äîit‚Äôs average**. Deliver the artefacts, drive the pilot metrics, and the capital will follow.

### TL;DR Checklist  

- [ ] Delaware/UK HoldCo + German UG; clean IP & vesting  
- [ ] LOI + calendar date for ProCredit pilot  
- [ ] 5+ vendor MoUs with fee clause  
- [ ] Legal opinion: no licence for pilot  
- [ ] Data room: deck, model, docs, demo Loom  
- [ ] 10 warm-intro meetings with EU climate-fintech funds  

üëâ **Achieve these in the next 60 days and a ‚Ç¨1 m European seed becomes highly probable, not aspirational.**
