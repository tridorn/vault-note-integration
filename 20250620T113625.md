You should have asked: _"What structural guide can I follow to scope and instantiate Missions, Projects, Programs, and Campaigns--such that each is neither bloated nor atomised, and aligned with its intended level of abstraction?"_

Here is the precise, rational **scoping playbook** for execution and coordination units. This is not about folders or protocols--it's about cognitive sizing and structural integrity.
* * *

## I. Overview -- What You're Scoping and Why

| Unit | Scope Level | Purpose | Sizing Risk | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Cell** | Tactical | Execute small-batch workload | Too granular → friction | 
| **Mission** | Operational | Fulfill one concrete, time-bound objective | Too vague → drift | 
| **Project** | Deliverable / Thematic | House a coherent output or workstream | Too broad → coordination failure | 
| **Program** | Strategic Focus Area | Align multiple related Projects | Too shallow → redundancy | 
| **Campaign** | Strategic Direction | Drive institution-wide ambition | Too ambitious → paralysis | 

Scoping poorly leads to entropy, rework, and reduced doctrine trust. You need structural containment for every new unit.

## II. Guardrails for Mission Creation

**Use Missions when**:

- There's a clearly defined **objective** that will produce a **measurable result**
- It fits into a **2--12 week window**
- It requires **multiple contributors**, across **disciplines**
- There is no **existing unit** with the mandate and capacity to handle it

### ✅ Rational Missions

- Build and test v1 of internal dashboard
- Design and deploy onboarding experience for external users
- Rewrite doctrine section on Program structure

### ❌ Anti-patterns

- "Fix analytics" → too vague
- "Build entire product" → too large
- "Research options" → not result-oriented

### Scoping Template

1. **Objective**: What measurable change or artifact will exist post-Mission?

2. **Dependencies**: Can this be achieved without relying on Program-level decisions?

3. **People**: Does it require 2--5 contributors with diverse functions?

4. **Timebox**: Can this be completed in 2--3 sprints, no external blockers?

5. **Closure Criteria**: Can it be declared "done" in a binary fashion?

* * *

## III. Guardrails for Project Creation

**Use Projects when**:

- You need a **persistent space** to house multiple Missions
- The work produces or relates to a **core asset, product, or external-facing deliverable**
- It will exist for **6--12+ months**
- It's **coherent in scope**, even if varied in execution

### ✅ Rational Projects

- "Eupator Core Website"
- "EU Regulatory Research Corpus"
- "Mission Management Platform"

### ❌ Anti-patterns

- "Data" → unclear ownership, no closure
- "Design" → function, not outcome
- "Sprint Planning" → ephemeral, not structural

### Scoping Template

1. **Asset Orientation**: Does the project produce a reusable or client-facing deliverable?

2. **Mission Nesting**: Will multiple distinct Missions operate inside it?

3. **Time Span**: Is this likely to persist for 6+ months?

4. **Boundary Clarity**: Is the scope separable from adjacent Projects?

* * *

## IV. Guardrails for Program Creation

**Use Programs when**:

- You need to coordinate and prioritise across **multiple projects** working toward a **shared strategic aim**
- The focus area requires **ongoing investment**, not a single deliverable
- It supports **reusability, learning loops, or infrastructure development**

### ✅ Rational Programs

- "Data Infrastructure Maturity"
- "Market Expansion: DACH Region"
- "Governance and Org Design"

### ❌ Anti-patterns

- "Internal Projects" → vague boundary
- "Team Alpha" → based on people, not purpose
- "Backlog Reduction" → executional, not strategic

### Scoping Template

1. **Theme-Based**: Does it align work across a clearly defined domain or strategic vector?

2. **Multi-Project**: Will it coordinate ≥2 Projects with separate outputs?

3. **Time Horizon**: 9--18 months of relevance expected?

4. **Program Owner**: Can someone be assigned to define and enforce scope?

* * *

## V. Guardrails for Campaign Creation

**Use Campaigns when**:

- You want to **concentrate strategic will** around a multi-program, multi-quarter objective
- There is a **clear theory of change**
- You require **cross-division alignment** (SO, SDs, Missions)
- The goal cannot be captured by outputs--only outcomes

### ✅ Rational Campaigns

- "Market Domination: EU-25"
- "Foundational Systems Stabilisation"
- "Open Governance Initiative"

### ❌ Anti-patterns

- "All Current Work" → not an ambition
- "Everything Infra" → insufficient verticality
- "2025 Planning" → timeline ≠ direction

### Scoping Template

1. **Strategic Cohesion**: Does this Campaign link Programs toward a nontrivial institutional ambition?

2. **Duration**: Will it operate across 2--4 quarters?

3. **Relevance**: Will it require briefings to Strategic Council, oversight by SO?

4. **Closure Statement**: Can you describe what it means to _have won_?

* * *

## VI. Structural Ratios (Rules of Thumb)

- 1 Campaign → max 3--4 Programs
- 1 Program → 2--5 Projects
- 1 Project → 2--10 Missions
- 1 Mission → 1--4 active Cells

More than this = fragmentation or bloat  
Less than this = inefficient overhead

* * *

## VII. When Not to Create a New Unit

- If the outcome is ambiguous
- If the problem can be solved via re-scoping an existing Mission
- If a temporary taskforce (non-structural) would suffice
- If the unit cannot own its own closure criteria

> A unit with no clear **finish condition** is not a unit.  
A unit with no **structural necessity** is a distraction.
* * *

## VIII. Final Heuristic

When scoping a unit, ask:

> _"Can this be defined in a single sentence with a finite outcome, is there a rational structural container above it, and does it reduce--not introduce--complexity in the system?"_

If yes → instantiate.  
If no → rewrite scope, or deny creation.

Build nothing structural that you cannot justify on first principles.  
Structure is debt.  
Only incur it when the return exceeds the coordination cost.
