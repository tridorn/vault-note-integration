# Create a New Version of a Note Instead of Updating Outdated Structures in Existing Notes

--- 

## Elaboration

Updating or changing something not only requires at time more time and energy than simply creating it new, one also looses the reference how the item looked before. So, instead of changing the existing note (best example is metadata), create a new one (while archiving the old one of course) and there switch to the new desired structure.
