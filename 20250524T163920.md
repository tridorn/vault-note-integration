**Spatial distance**--between Mannheim, Karlsruhe (KIT), Darmstadt (TU), and potentially others--is a **minor physical constraint**, but a **major coordination problem** if not designed correctly. The solution is not to "centralise," but to **architect a node--hub model** where signal and control are centralised, but discovery and activity are decentralised.
* * *

## I. Structural Response: _Hub--Node Operating Model_

| Role | Factory HQ (Mannheim) | Regional University Nodes | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Governance** | Board meetings, IP/licence management, grant admin, KPI tracking | None--input only | 
| **Operations** | Venture architects, core sprints, funding decisions | Scouting, local workshops, project preparation | 
| **Identity** | "The Factory" = single institution, neutral & regional | Nodes are branded as satellites or "local desks" (e.g. Factory@KIT) | 
| **Staffing** | Full-time, salaried, centralised | 0.2--0.5 FTE per uni (liaison + student intern) | 

This way, **strategy and execution are central**, but **early-stage sourcing is local**.

* * *

## II. Workflow Integration Across Cities

### 1. **Scouting & Intake**

- Each university has a named **Liaison Officer** (professor-backed, not junior).
- Factory provides _opportunity card template_ + SOPs for internal scouting.
- Liaisons run quarterly "discovery sessions" or pitch days locally.
- All incoming projects are logged in a **central dealflow board** (Airtable, Notion, etc.).
- Central Factory team shortlists for sprints--location-agnostic.

### 2. **Validation Sprint**

- Run centrally in **Mannheim**, 3 times per year.
- Teams from all cities **travel in** for kickoff + demo day only.
- Intermediate coaching is **hybrid-first** (calls, Miro, Notion, Slack).
- Sprint costs cover travel/hotel as a grant-eligible expense.
- Teams are mixed across universities to enforce cross-pollination.

### 3. **Physical Space Allocation**

- Factory HQ (e.g. MAFINEX) hosts:  
• Sprints  
• Studio teams  
• Visiting teams for build phase

- Regional nodes host:  
• Info events  
• Coaching days  
• Local prototyping

### 4. **Studio Build Phase**

Once Eupator spins out a project, the company picks its HQ--could be Mannheim, Karlsruhe, or hybrid.  
Eupator maintains legal seat + ops core in Mannheim; startups are free to base where talent fits.

## III. Digital Infrastructure (non-negotiable)

You will need a **unified digital backbone** from day one to neutralise geographic spread.

| Function | Tool | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Dealflow tracking | Airtable (or Streak CRM) | 
| Sprint collaboration | Notion + Slack + Miro | 
| Founder portal | Google Workspace / Notion / internal LMS | 
| IP docs + legal | DocuSign + central vault (Nextcloud, etc.) | 

This isn't optional. Physical cohesion will always be limited--**digital protocol replaces proximity**.

* * *

## IV. Cultural Management

### 1. **One Brand, Not Three**

Avoid factionalism. This is not KIT's factory or Mannheim's--it's **Rhine-Neckar's**.

> All public events, materials, logos, and messaging refer only to _"The Factory"_.

### 2. **Distributed Heroism**

Highlight project successes from _every_ node, not just HQ.  
Run "Founder Origin Spotlights" that explicitly name their university.

### 3. **Embedded Mobility**

Incentivise talent to cross-pollinate:

- Business students from Mannheim paired with KIT engineers.
- Travel stipends offered by corporates.
- Factory roadshow rotates each quarter: Karlsruhe → Mannheim → Darmstadt.
* * *

## V. Why This Works

- **Universities** feel represented, not subordinated.
- **Teams** get centralised velocity without local silos.
- **Studio** gains fully regional access without owning logistical chaos.
- **Factory** keeps clean metrics, clean reporting, and simple budgeting.
* * *

## Summary Model

**Hub** = Mannheim HQ
- Legal seat
- Funding control
- Sprint operation
- Studio interface

**Nodes** = Faculty-backed desks at KIT, TUD, others
- Local scouting
- Talent intake
- Events

**Virtual layer** = Single digital stack
- Dealflow
- Program ops
- Knowledge base

This setup mirrors how serious multi-city accelerators (e.g. Y Combinator pre-remote, Entrepreneur First, Founders Factory Africa) operate. The geography is real--but coordination defeats distance.
