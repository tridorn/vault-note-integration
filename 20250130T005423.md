During the execution of each micro-action within the **IEHN Protocol**, it is preferable to avoid thinking about the broader context or subsequent steps. The purpose of focusing solely on the immediate, small action is to disentangle it from any associations that might induce resistance or anxiety about the larger task. By isolating each micro-action from its broader goal, you allow your mind to engage with it neutrally, helping to condition it as a non-threatening, habitual behavior.

### **Reasons To Avoid Broader Contextual Thoughts**

1. **Preventing Cognitive Overload**: Linking the micro-action to a larger sequence (such as considering the entirety of a workout after simply getting dressed) can activate the mental resistance associated with that broader task. Your brain may start to anticipate the upcoming physical exertion, which could undermine the neutrality of the initial action and bring back the resistance you're aiming to diminish.

2. **Fostering Present-Moment Awareness**: By focusing entirely on the immediate task, you promote a form of mindfulness that reinforces your sensory and cognitive connection to the present action. This mindful engagement is key to reprogramming your response to the task, fostering a habit that is entirely divorced from the usual patterns of avoidance or stress.

3. **Building Micro-Actions as Self-Contained Units**: One objective of the protocol is to condition each micro-action as a self-contained, non-threatening event. Each micro-action should be valued in isolation rather than as a step in a daunting process. In time, you will begin to experience each micro-action as a low-resistance entry point rather than as an intimidating precursor to the larger task.

### **How To Focus During the Micro-Action**

To ensure your focus remains on the present action:  
	- **Engage the Senses**: Pay attention to the immediate sensory details of the action. For example, if you’re dressing for sports, notice the texture of the fabric, the physical motion of putting on each item, or the sounds around you.  
	- **Briefly Acknowledge Completion**: Once you’ve finished the micro-action, take a short moment to mentally acknowledge the completion of that task alone, enjoying the satisfaction that comes from this single achievement. Avoid immediately shifting your mind to what comes next.

### **When Broader Context Becomes Relevant**

Eventually, as you progress through the protocol and resistance begins to dissolve, there may come a time (likely in the **Advanced Stage**) when connecting micro-actions to the broader context is constructive. At that point, your comfort with the initial steps is stable, and they can be naturally linked to larger goals without re-triggering resistance. In this later stage, you might begin to allow a light awareness of the broader activity, provided it feels genuinely motivating rather than daunting.

### **Summary**

For now, keep each micro-action narrowly focused on itself, untethered from the context of what it leads to. This isolation is central to transforming it into a routine, neutral habit—one you can eventually integrate into the broader task flow without resistance.
