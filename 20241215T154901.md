Your query could be better phrased as: *"Using general domains as a reference, what types of content—such as recipes or Stoic notes—are best allocated to Drafts, Obsidian, or my physical system? How should I refine the use cases for these tools?"*

---

### **General Domains for Notes and Their Allocation**

Below is a domain-based categorization for each system, clarifying their proper use cases:

---

### **1. Drafts: Short-Term, Transient, and Quick Access**

Drafts thrives as an intermediary and ephemeral capture tool. It is for *quickly accessing* or *temporarily storing* content that doesn't yet belong in a structured system.

#### **Domains for Drafts**
- **Action-Oriented Content:**
  - Tasks, to-dos, or ideas that need processing soon (e.g., "Email professor about AMU report").
- **Fleeting Ideas or Inspiration:**
  - Notes on sudden inspirations or incomplete thoughts (e.g., "Link Stoicism with adaptive leadership").
- **Frequently Accessed or Temporary Lists:**
  - Shopping lists, quick recipes, or repetitive items (e.g., "Basic pancake recipe for breakfast").
- **Unsorted Content:**
  - Content you don’t yet know where to store but want to capture (e.g., "Should physical systems be mapped digitally?").

#### **Key Principle:**  
Think of Drafts as a "front door" for your ideas. Its purpose is *processing*, not *permanence.* Regularly move notes into their permanent homes (Obsidian or physical).

### **2. Obsidian: Formalized, Structured Knowledge Repository**

Obsidian is best suited for *organized, long-term knowledge* that benefits from categorization, linking, and relational depth. It’s the digital equivalent of a library.

#### **Domains for Obsidian**
- **Knowledge Frameworks and Reflections:**
  - Notes on Stoicism, philosophical frameworks, or personal insights (e.g., "Applying Epictetus' dichotomy of control").
- **Research and Learning:**
  - Summaries of books, articles, or courses (e.g., "Summary of 'Meditations' Book IV").
- **Project Documentation:**
  - Plans for your company (Ben Dyk), AMU missions, or cultural initiatives.
- **Permanent Reference Material:**
  - Recipes you use frequently and want cataloged (e.g., "Pasta carbonara recipe with variations").
- **Thematic Collections:**
  - Notes grouped by topic, such as leadership practices, productivity systems, or Stoic principles.

#### **Key Principle:**  
Obsidian is for ideas or content you want to *build upon, reference, or connect* over time. If it’s part of your evolving knowledge base, it belongs here.

### **3. Physical System: Ideation and Tactile Engagement**

Your physical system serves as a *thinking space* for creativity and brainstorming, as well as an anchor for tactile interaction.

#### **Domains for Physical System**
- **Visual Thinking and Design:**
  - Mind maps, diagrams, and conceptual sketches (e.g., "Sketching a workflow for Obsidian integration").
- **Creative Ideation:**
  - Brainstorming sessions, freewriting, or outlining (e.g., "Draft ideas for Stoic prompts in Anki").
- **Strategic Planning:**
  - Layouts for projects, frameworks, or physical storyboards (e.g., "Plan AKB's IT infrastructure visually").
- **Emotionally or Intellectually Engaging Notes:**
  - Ideas you want to physically interact with to gain clarity (e.g., writing Stoic principles by hand to embody them better).

#### **Key Principle:**  
Use the physical system when you need *tactile interaction, creativity, or spatial visualization*. Once stable, transfer outcomes to Obsidian for structured storage.

### **Examples by Domain**

#### **Domain: Recipes**
- **Drafts:**  
  - Temporary or infrequent recipes (e.g., "Quick smoothie idea").  
- **Obsidian:**  
  - A curated recipe collection you frequently reference or refine.  
- **Physical System:**  
  - Handwritten or visual meal plans for brainstorming or exploring creativity in cooking.

#### **Domain: Stoicism**
- **Drafts:**  
  - Sudden insights or daily reminders (e.g., "Reflect on dichotomy of control today").  
- **Obsidian:**  
  - Long-term structured content, such as Stoic principles and their applications.  
- **Physical System:**  
  - Writing maxims by hand to internalize or brainstorming philosophical applications.

#### **Domain: Company Projects**
- **Drafts:**  
  - Quick notes on tasks or ideas (e.g., "Discuss AMU branding during meeting").  
- **Obsidian:**  
  - Detailed documentation, plans, and summaries.  
- **Physical System:**  
  - Mind maps, frameworks, or tactile brainstorming sessions.

#### **Domain: General Notes**
- **Drafts:**  
  - Anything ephemeral or unsorted.  
- **Obsidian:**  
  - Notes that have reached a level of permanence or organization.  
- **Physical System:**  
  - Content that benefits from tactile engagement or creativity.

### **Workflow Recommendations**
1. **Capture in Drafts:** Use Drafts as the initial holding space for all transient ideas.  
2. **Review and Organize:** Periodically process Drafts and distribute notes to their correct systems.  
3. **Consolidate in Obsidian:** Migrate structured knowledge and permanent references here.  
4. **Ideate in Physical:** Use your physical system to engage deeply with ideas, then formalize outcomes in Obsidian.
