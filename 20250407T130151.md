Refined version of your question:

> *Where exactly is the backend hosted when I use Supabase—since Vercel only handles the frontend? And what kind of costs am I realistically looking at, both at launch and if I scale? Give me some example scenarios.*

---

### **Where is Supabase hosted?**

Supabase **hosts your backend on its own managed cloud**, powered by:

- **PostgreSQL** as your database
- Supabase’s own infrastructure for:
  - Auth
  - Storage
  - Edge Functions (for backend logic)
  - Realtime (via WebSockets)
- Globally distributed (Edge CDN + Realtime sync nodes)

You **don’t set up any servers**. Supabase gives you a dashboard, CLI, APIs, and SDKs. It’s true Backend-as-a-Service.

---

### **Where your app lives**

| Layer        | Hosted by      | What it does                         |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Frontend** | **Vercel**     | UI, pages, API routes, server-rendered content |
| **Backend**  | **Supabase**   | Auth, DB, storage, API, logic        |
| **Edge logic** | Vercel *or* Supabase | (Optional) Lightweight serverless functions (e.g., payments, webhook handling) |

---

### **Costs – Real Examples**

#### **1. Solo Founder MVP (early launch)**  
- 2–3 tables  
- 100–200 users  
- Light traffic (500 pageviews/day)

| Item | Provider | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| Frontend hosting | Vercel | **Free** (Hobby plan) |
| Backend (DB + Auth + Storage) | Supabase | **Free** (Free tier) |
| Custom domain | Namecheap/etc. | ~$10/year |

**Total: $0/month**

---

#### **2. Early Traction Phase**  
- 1,000+ users  
- 10–20 tables  
- Realtime chat or dashboard  
- 5,000–10,000 monthly active users

| Item | Provider | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| Vercel | Hobby tier still fine | **Free** |
| Supabase | Pro plan | **$25/month** |
| Storage (5GB+ assets) | Included up to 100GB | $0 extra |
| Edge Functions | 500K/month free, then $0.10/100K | <$5/month |

**Total: ~$25–30/month**

---

#### **3. Scaling Startup**  
- 100,000+ users  
- Large data models  
- High read/write DB traffic  
- Multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)

| Item | Provider | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| Vercel | Pro ($20/user/month) | ~$60–100/month |
| Supabase | Pro + usage | ~$100–300/month |
| Add-ons (e.g. Stripe, analytics) | Various | ~$50–100/month |

**Total: ~$200–500/month**, depending on actual usage

---

### **Cost Notes**
- Supabase scales cost **gradually**: you’re never hit with massive bills
- Pricing is transparent: [https://supabase.com/pricing](https://supabase.com/pricing)
- **You pay for usage**, not for idle capacity (no overpaying for “just in case” servers)
- Most early-stage products stay under **$50/month total** until serious traction

---

### **Verdict**
You get:
- A **production-grade backend** without hiring a backend team
- Deployment without DevOps
- Real-time sync, storage, auth, DB—ready on day one

**Supabase hosts the backend. Vercel hosts the frontend. You manage neither.**

Want me to give you a precise breakdown based on your actual idea (number of users, features, assets)? I’ll run the numbers.
