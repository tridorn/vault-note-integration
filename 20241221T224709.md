Certainly! Below are **examples of how to apply the refined Stoic noting system** across various common scenarios, using the flow of the five phases:

---

### **Example 1: Frustration with a Colleague**

- **Situation:** A colleague interrupts you during a meeting, and you feel irritated.

#### **1. Noticing**

- You recognize a surge of irritation.
- Awareness: "I’m getting frustrated."

#### **2. Noting (Discipline of Assent)**

- Label: "Judging" (I’m judging their behavior negatively).
- Thought: "They’re always interrupting me. How rude."

#### **3. Reflecting (Virtue of Justice)**

- Ask:  
  - “Am I being fair in my judgment?”  
  - “What’s my duty in this situation?”  
- Realization: “My role is to handle interruptions calmly and constructively.”

#### **4. Redirecting**

- Replace: “They’re rude!” with “I’ll clarify my point politely after they finish.”
- Action: Take a deep breath, wait for your turn, and respond calmly.

#### **5. Moving On**

- Release the frustration: “I handled that with justice. Time to focus on the discussion.”

#### **3. Reflecting (Virtue of Courage)**
