Your question, refined:

> *What language is Supabase built with? Can I use templates or starter kits to move faster? If I use Next.js for the frontend and Supabase for the backend, do I have a complete full-stack setup—or are there missing pieces I need to worry about?*

---

### **1. Supabase’s Internal Language (Under the Hood)**  
- **PostgreSQL** is the core database engine  
- The **Supabase platform** is built with:
  - **Elixir** (API & real-time features via Phoenix framework)
  - **TypeScript** (dashboard, client libraries)
  - **Rust** (performance-heavy services)
- But **you never have to touch any of that.**

You interact with it using **SQL** (for data), and **JavaScript/TypeScript** (via the client SDK).

---

### **2. Can You Use Templates? Yes—and You Should.**

**Supabase offers official and community templates:**
- **Next.js + Supabase** starter kits  
- Examples for:
  - Auth (email, magic link, OAuth)
  - Stripe integration
  - Realtime chats
  - CRUD dashboards
- **CLI command:** `npx create-next-app -e with-supabase`  
  Sets up the full stack instantly

Browse: [supabase.com/starters](https://supabase.com/starters)

You can be up and running with a full auth + database app in **5 minutes**.

### **3. Is Next.js + Supabase a Complete Full-Stack?**

**Yes.**  
It gives you **everything you need** for modern product development:

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Frontend | **Next.js** | UI, routing, SSR/ISR/SPA, SEO |
| Backend | **Supabase** | Database, auth, storage, APIs, serverless logic |
| Data Sync | Supabase Realtime | Live updates over websockets |
| Auth | Supabase | Email, password, Google, GitHub, Magic Links |
| APIs | Supabase auto-generated | REST, GraphQL, Edge Functions |
| Storage | Supabase | File uploads, CDN-backed |
| Deployment | **Vercel** (for Next.js) | Fast, global, serverless |
| Monitoring | Vercel/Supabase dashboards | Usage, errors, performance |

**Nothing else is required.**  
You only add other tools if your app grows in complexity—payments, queue systems, analytics, etc.

---

**Verdict:**  
- Supabase + Next.js is *not just viable*—it’s currently one of the **most elegant full-stack setups** you can choose in 2025.  
- You write in **one language: TypeScript**  
- You avoid DevOps  
- You get modern power without legacy overhead
