**A sharper formulation of your prompt would be:** _"Before legal incorporation and formal accounts exist, which preparatory actions--technical, legal-administrative, and organisational--can I execute right now without risk of re-work?"_
* * *

### Immediate Moves (zero paperwork, zero liability)

1. **Lock the Name**

    - Register the root domain (`eupator.com`) and defensive variants (`.de`, `.eu`, `.ai`) via Cloudflare Registrar.

    - File an EUIPO TM search (free) to confirm no obvious collision.

2. **Stand-up a Private Git Ledger**

    - Open a personal GitHub **Free** organisation (`org-eupator-sandbox`).

    - Create the **`doctrine`** repo and begin drafting Section I (principles, design logic).

    - Add `.obsidian/` to `.gitignore` and start writing in Obsidian today.

3. **Reserve Object Storage in Free Tier**

    - Activate a Cloudflare R2 account (first 10 GB free).

    - Create `sandbox/assets` and `sandbox/git-lfs` buckets.

    - Generate an API token--you'll migrate it to a company account later.

4. **Draft Legal Skeleton (No Notary Needed Yet)**

    - Write a plaintext **Founders' Term Sheet** in `doctrine/legal/00_founder-agreement.md`.

    - Capture: equity split, vesting idea, IP assignment-on-incorporation clause.

    - This draft costs nothing and steers later notarisation.

5. **Design the Folder/Repo Blueprint in Dry-Run Mode**

    - In the sandbox org, create empty repos:

        - `infra` (Terraform placeholders)

        - `shared-library` (blank)

        - `projects` (with one test project folder).

    - Push an empty workflow file to prove CI runs even without runners.

6. **Write First ProcessCard**

    - Create `doctrine/03_Units/mission.md` and a ten-step **ProcessCard** for "Mission spin-up".

    - Treat this as the template you'll follow once capital exists.

7. **Set Up Free Slack Workspace**

    - Name: _eupator-sandbox_.

    - One channel `#m01-test` for yourself; verify Slack -> GitHub app handshake works.

8. **Personal Email Alias**

    - Buy a single Google Workspace "Business Starter" licence (â‚¬6 / month).

    - Establish `you@eupator.com` and `admin@eupator.com`.

    - This later becomes the super-admin account for the corporate tenant.

9. **Draft the Minimum Domain Policy**

    - In the `doctrine` repo add `infra/dns-domain-policy.md`.

    - Record how sub-domains will map to apps (`docs.`, `corp.`, `status.`).

    - Writing policy costs nothing now but avoids naming chaos later.

### What You **Must Not** Do Yet
- **Open a business bank account** or notarise--costly and irreversible pre-product.
- **Purchase paid SaaS beyond one e-mail seat**--work in free tiers until incorporation.
- **Issue invoices or sign client NDAs**--no legal entity exists to enforce them.
* * *

### Why These Steps Matter

- **Domain + trademark** locks brand surface before predators squat it.
- **Git sandbox** builds muscle memory for your doctrine; upgrading to paid seats is a push-button migration.
- **Object storage** lets you trial LFS workflows without billing.
- **Founders' term sheet** hardens expectations before equity becomes real and emotional.
- **ProcessCard drafts** mean you hit day 1 with operating muscle, not whiteboard wishes.

### Timeline

| Day | Action | 
| ---- | ----  |
| 1 | Register domains, create Google Workspace alias, open GitHub org | 
| 2 | Push `doctrine` repo, draft Section I & first ProcessCard | 
| 3 | Spin up Cloudflare R2 buckets, configure Git LFS, push sample binary | 
| 4 | Set up Slack, connect GitHub app, validate slash-command test | 
| 5 | Draft founders' term sheet, commit to repo | 
| 6 | Write domain-policy doc, verify CI pipeline triggers | 
| 7 | Review everything, note gaps, schedule notary for post-MVP window | 

Seven days of part-time effort transforms a blank slate into a **versioned, auditable, and legally pre-hardened nucleus**--ready for capital injection the moment you incorporate.
