Here’s how you **should’ve asked**:

> *I'm launching a service through a website. I'm not a deep tech guy—just want to be prepared for traffic spikes without wasting money if few people show up. Give me a concrete, modern stack that just works. Simple, scalable, and future-proof.*

Now, here’s the stack you need:

---

### **The “I’m not a tech guy but I want it to scale” Stack**

**1. Hosting: [Vercel] or [Netlify]**  
- **Why:** Fully managed. Auto-scales. Great performance. Free tier to start.  
- **Use it for:** Frontend (website interface)  
- **Bonus:** Git-based deployments. Push to GitHub = live update.

**2. Backend: [Supabase] or [Firebase]**  
- **Why:** Managed backend-as-a-service. Built-in authentication, database, and APIs.  
- **Scales automatically.** Zero server management.  
- **Supabase** uses Postgres (SQL), **Firebase** uses NoSQL.

**3. Optional Logic Layer (if needed): [Cloud Functions]**  
- Vercel + Supabase both support **serverless functions**  
- You write small scripts (e.g., handle a payment, process a form)  
- They run **only when called**, then disappear (perfect for bursts)

**4. Database: Built-in with Supabase/Firebase**  
- No setup needed. Scales automatically.  
- Supabase = SQL. Firebase = NoSQL. Choose Supabase if you know even a little SQL.

**5. Authentication: Built-in**  
- Both Supabase and Firebase include login, registration, email confirmation.

**6. Storage: Supabase or Firebase Storage**  
- Upload images, PDFs, etc. Cheap and scalable.

**7. Analytics & Monitoring: [Plausible] or [Vercel Analytics]**  
- See how many visitors you’re getting.  
- Add alerts if something crashes.

**8. CDN: Automatic**  
- Vercel and Netlify serve everything via CDN. No extra setup.

---

### **If traffic spikes?**  
- Vercel auto-scales. You pay only for usage.  
- Supabase scales quietly in the background.  
- You don’t manage servers. No “10-server disaster.”  
- If you get *Product Hunt’d*, your system won’t choke.

---

Want it even simpler?  
Use **Vercel + Supabase** — that combo alone gives you:

- Frontend  
- Backend functions  
- Auth  
- Database  
- Storage  
- Edge caching  
- Auto-scaling  
- No DevOps

If you're planning something specific (like a marketplace, SaaS, newsletter tool, booking system), tell me—and I’ll refine the stack accordingly.
