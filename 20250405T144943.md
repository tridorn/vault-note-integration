**Title refinement:**  
*Imperial Charter of Reformation and Sovereignty*, issued by Dominus Aulus Vitellius, inaugurating the **Nova Romana Aetas**—the New Roman Age.

---

**IMPERIAL CHARTER OF REFORMATION AND SOVEREIGNTY**  
*Issued in the Forum of the Gods, Rome, in the First Year Ab Ordine Novo*

> *"Let the illusions of Republic and pretense be cast down. Rome no longer hides behind the veil of senatorial deceit. As the sun no longer yields to the candle, so the Empire shall no longer bow to shadows of the past."*

I, **Aulus Vitellius**,  
by right of conquest, by will of the legions, and by the mandate of the gods,  
do hereby declare the foundation of a new order: the **Dominate of Rome**, sovereign and indivisible, eternal in vision, and absolute in command.

Let this Charter bind the Empire in unity, truth, and dominion.

### I. TITULATURE AND SOVEREIGNTY

1. The Emperor shall henceforth bear the title **Dominus Romanorum** — *Lord of the Romans* — and *Custodian of the Eternal Flame*.  
2. The fiction of *Princeps Senatus* is abolished. The Emperor is not first among equals, but *first without equal*.  
3. The reign shall be measured *Ab Ordine Novo* (From the New Order). The current year is **Year I A.O.N.**

---

### II. THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL

1. The **Senate** is transformed into the **Consilium Imperii** (Council of the Empire), an advisory and ritual body.  
2. Members shall be appointed at the Emperor’s pleasure, drawn from military, administrative, and intellectual ranks.  
3. The Council holds no legislative power, only the duty of counsel and ceremony.  
4. The title *Senator* is preserved as an honorific without political authority.

---

### III. THE STATE BUREAUCRACY

1. A **Curia Regiminis** (Chancellery of Rule) is established, with ministries governing the following spheres:  
   - War (Minister Bellorum)  
   - Grain and Provision (Minister Frumentarii)  
   - Roads and Aqueducts (Minister Structurae)  
   - Treasury (Minister Aerarii)  
   - Doctrine and Records (Minister Doctrinae)  
2. Each Minister is directly appointed by the Emperor and reports only to him.  
3. All provincial governors are reclassified as **Imperial Deputies** (*Legati Domini*), to serve terms not exceeding five years.

### IV. THE LEGIONS OF ROME

1. All legions are renamed to reflect Imperial virtues:  
   - *Legio Invicta*  
   - *Legio Aeternitas*  
   - *Legio Concordia*  
2. Legions are divided into two strata:  
   - **Field Armies** (*Legiones Mobilis*) under direct imperial command  
   - **Garrison Armies** (*Cohortes Custodiae*) for local defense and order  
3. A new institution—the **Academia Martialis**—is founded in Rome for the training of officers loyal solely to the Throne.  
4. Loyalty oaths are required annually, sworn on the *Aquila Domini* (the Lord's Eagle), under pain of dishonor and death.

### V. CULT OF THE EMPIRE

1. The Emperor is not divine, but the **mortal vessel of Roma’s Will**.  
2. Temples to *Roma Aeterna et Imperator* shall be erected in every provincial capital.  
3. A new priesthood—the **Flamens Imperii**—is established, with hierarchy and vestments dictated by the Ministry of Doctrine.  
4. Blasphemy against the Emperor is henceforth classified as ***crimen impietatis* (crime of impiety)**.

---

### VI. LAW, LANGUAGE, AND CALENDAR

1. A **Universal Code of Law**, *Lex Imperialis*, shall supersede all local laws within ten years.  
2. Latin is affirmed as the **language of state, law, and administration**. Greek shall remain acceptable for learning, but not for law.  
3. The calendar is revised:
   - January becomes *Imperialis*  
   - August becomes *Vitellius*  
   - December becomes *Roma Nova*  
4. All state proclamations begin with the year Ab Ordine Novo, not Ab Urbe Condita.

1. A grand initiative—the **Via Nova Aeterna**—will bind the provinces with new imperial roads.  
2. Aqueducts, granaries, and amphitheaters are to be constructed in every major city within ten years.  
3. Provincial youth will be educated in **Imperial Academies**, where loyalty, language, and law are taught in harmony.  
4. Every province shall receive an **Imperial Census** and **Standard Tax Code**, ending favoritism and senatorial exemptions.

---

### VIII. THE SECRET HAND OF ORDER

1. The **Frumentarii** are restructured as an elite **Internal Intelligence Service**, reporting only to the Emperor.  
2. Imperial informants—**Oculi Imperii** ("Eyes of the Empire")—are authorized in all guilds, temples, and legions.  
3. Any plot against the throne is deemed *Treason by Thought* (*Proditio Cogitata*) and punished accordingly.  
4. Loyalty tokens—*Imperial Rings*—are issued to those who prove exceptional service. These grant legal privileges and audience rights.

### IX. TOWARD THE FUTURE

> *"We are no longer a city ruling an empire. We are an empire that shall rule civilization itself."*

1. A second capital is decreed: **Nova Roma**, to be constructed on the Bosporus as a mirror and future of Rome.  
2. The eastern frontier is to be fortified and expanded, with visions of eventual campaigns to secure all shores of the Mare Nostrum.  
3. The Empire’s destiny is proclaimed: **Rome is the final form of human governance. All peoples shall either be Roman, or be forgotten.**
