# Assent, Desire and Aversion, Action

It would have been more precise to ask: “Could you delve deeply into the nature and application of *assent*, *desire* and *aversion*, and *action* in Stoicism, explaining their nuances and the range of situations they cover?”

Here is a thorough examination of each of these elements, central to the Stoic process of moral judgment and action:

---

**1. Assent (The Faculty of Judgment)**

*Assent* refers to the Stoic’s capacity to judge impressions or appearances (*phantasiai*) and decide whether to accept, reject, or withhold judgment. It is the gateway between external events and our internal state—by controlling assent, we control how external stimuli affect us emotionally and cognitively.

- **What It Is**:  
  Assent is the act of agreeing with or endorsing a particular impression that arises from an external event. These impressions are neither inherently good nor bad; they are simply data received by the mind. What matters is how we interpret them.  
  For example, an impression may come in the form of a thought: “This person insulted me.” The Stoic, before reacting emotionally, would examine whether this impression is accurate and whether it is worth assenting to.

- **When to Withhold Assent**:  
  Withholding assent is essential when an impression is dubious, misleading, or emotionally charged. The Stoic school emphasizes that many of our initial impressions are erroneous, often clouded by emotion or instinct.  
  - For example, when someone cuts you off in traffic, your initial impression may be anger and the thought “They did that to spite me!” Withholding assent means recognizing that this thought is likely an overreaction and not necessarily true.
  
- **When to Give Assent**:  
  Stoics assent to impressions only when they have been critically examined and found to align with reason and reality. Giving assent to a true impression would involve acknowledging something that is in accord with reason and the natural order.  
  - For example, after reflecting on the traffic incident, you might conclude: “This person’s driving is out of my control. My reaction is within my control.”

- **What Assent Covers**:  
  Assent pertains to every thought or impression that comes to mind, particularly those which lead to emotions or actions. By controlling assent, we regulate our emotional life and prevent ourselves from being led astray by irrational feelings such as anger, envy, or fear.

- **Practical Example**:  
  If you receive feedback at work that you perceive as negative, your first impression might be: “I am being unfairly criticized.” The Stoic practice is to withhold assent to this negative emotion until you have rationally evaluated the feedback. After reflection, you might instead assent to the idea: “This feedback is an opportunity for growth, regardless of whether it feels uncomfortable.”

**2. Desire and Aversion (Focusing on Internals)**

Desire and aversion are intimately related to Stoic *prohairesis* (moral choice) because they govern our internal attitudes toward what we seek or avoid. These categories directly correspond to the Stoic understanding of what is *in our control* versus *outside our control*.

- **Desire**:  
  In Stoicism, desire (*orexis*) refers to a rational longing for something that is within our control—primarily virtue and moral progress. To desire anything external (wealth, status, approval) is a misalignment of our will with nature because those things are outside our control and are considered morally indifferent.

  - **Right Desire**: The only proper object of desire for a Stoic is virtue or moral improvement. This means seeking to be wise, just, courageous, and temperate in all actions. Desiring anything external, even things like health or safety, is a potential source of distress if it is not within our power to attain.
    - *Example*: Desiring to be virtuous in a challenging situation, rather than desiring the situation to be easy.
  
  - **Misguided Desire**: Desiring externals such as wealth, fame, or comfort leads to unnecessary suffering because these things are subject to chance and external forces. Stoics train to reduce or eliminate such desires because they divert focus from what is within their control.
    - *Example*: Desiring a promotion at work and becoming upset when external factors prevent it.

- **Aversion**:  
  Aversion (*ekklisis*) refers to the Stoic's emotional avoidance of something. Stoicism teaches that aversion should only apply to vice (actions or thoughts contrary to virtue). Avoiding or fearing external circumstances—such as illness, poverty, or social disapproval—is irrational because these are not within our control.

  - **Right Aversion**: The Stoic should develop an aversion to moral failings—such as cowardice, injustice, or intemperance—because these are within one’s control and are detrimental to living virtuously.
    - *Example*: Feeling aversion toward acting unjustly or dishonestly, even if it is socially advantageous.
  
  - **Misguided Aversion**: Most people fear or avoid things like discomfort, embarrassment, or loss. Stoicism teaches that these fears are irrational because they concern things outside our control and are morally indifferent. For example, avoiding a difficult conversation out of fear of embarrassment represents misguided aversion.
    - *Example*: Aversion to public speaking based on the fear of judgment, which is external and beyond your control.

- **What Desire and Aversion Cover**:  
  Desire and aversion govern all internal wishes and avoidances. They shape how we approach life’s situations, dictating whether we focus on virtue or external outcomes. Mastering them allows the Stoic to remain tranquil regardless of circumstances.

- **Practical Example**:  
  Imagine wanting approval from a colleague but recognizing that their opinion is outside your control. Stoic practice would involve redirecting your desire toward maintaining integrity and acting justly, while avoiding fear or aversion to their potential disapproval.

**3. Action (Rational and Virtuous Behavior)**

*Action* in Stoicism is the practical application of rational will in everyday life. Once assent has been given to a rational impression, and desire is correctly aligned with what is in our control, the next step is to take appropriate action. Stoic action is always governed by virtue.

- **What It Is**:  
  Stoic action involves deliberate, reasoned responses to situations in accordance with virtue. Once a Stoic has determined that an action is within their control and that it aligns with moral principles, they act without hesitation or emotional interference.

- **Right Action**:  
  The right action is any action that embodies the Stoic virtues of wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. This means taking action that is rational, ethical, and in harmony with nature.  
  - *Example*: Standing up for a colleague who is being treated unfairly, even if doing so is uncomfortable or difficult.
  
- **Avoiding Inaction**:  
  Stoicism emphasizes that while we cannot control outcomes, we are always responsible for our actions. Therefore, a Stoic does not use the principle of *Dichotomy of Control* as an excuse for inaction or fatalism. While you cannot control the result, you can control how you act in any given moment.
  
- **Practical Example**:  
  If a Stoic faces a difficult conversation with a friend, after assenting to the impression that it is necessary and aligning desire with virtuous behavior, the Stoic will act—engaging in the conversation calmly, with justice and integrity, regardless of the discomfort involved or the potential external outcome.

**Summary of Cases Covered by Assent, Desire and Aversion, and Action:**

- **Assent**:  
  - Applies to *perceptions and thoughts*. Whenever you receive an impression, whether of a situation, a person, or an idea, assent regulates whether you judge that impression as true and worthy of belief.
  - Example: An insult is directed at you. Assent allows you to withhold immediate emotional reactions and instead rationally determine that the insult does not affect your moral character.

- **Desire and Aversion**:  
  - Applies to *internal wishes and fears*. Desire and aversion control what you long for and what you avoid. In Stoic practice, these should only be applied to things within your control (virtue) and should never be attached to externals (health, wealth, reputation).
  - Example: Desiring to be courageous in a moment of fear, and feeling aversion toward acting unjustly.

- **Action**:  
  - Applies to *behaviors and responses*. Once assent has been given to a rational impression, and desires are aligned correctly, the next step is taking action that aligns with virtue and reason.
  - Example: Acting fairly in a situation, even if the outcome is uncertain or unfavorable.

By mastering these three elements, you build the foundation of Stoic moral discipline: rational judgment (*assent*), correct orientation toward desires (*desire and aversion*), and virtuous conduct (*action*). Together, they encompass every aspect of human thought and behavior, ensuring that you remain in harmony with both your nature and the natural order.
