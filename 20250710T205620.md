Sharpened formulation of the prompt

A more operative request is: "Enumerate the indispensable software stack for the Tristan Dornhelm persona, with terse justification for each component's role in a sovereign, reproducible, and compartmentalised environment."

* * *

### 1. Foundation -- Identity & Secrets

| 

Vector

 | 

Program

 | 

Rationale

 | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 

Passwords / Secrets

 | 

Bitwarden (self-hosted via Vaultwarden) + Bitwarden mobile

 | 

Cloud-independent, zero-knowledge, GUI-friendly; CLI usable in CI; exportable to JSON for cold backup.

 | 
| 

TOTP / U2F

 | 

Aegis (Android) / Raivo OTP (iOS) + Solokey (FIDO2)

 | 

Hardware key for critical surfaces; Aegis/Raivo for soft tokens stored in encrypted device backups.

 | 
| 

PGP / File encryption

 | 

age (via rage) for files; GnuPG only where legacy demands

 | 

age is modern, minimal attack surface; GPG relegated to email signing.

 | 

* * *

### 2. Operating Strata -- System & Code
- NixOS + Home-Manager -- declarative, reproducible; Git-backed; single-command rebuild.
- Direnv + Nix Flakes -- per-directory deterministic dev shells; zero "works on my machine" drift.
- Alacritty (terminal) + tmux (session persistence) -- GPU-accelerated rendering, detachable workflows.
- Neovim configured as IDE -- scriptable, portable, no vendor telemetry.
* * *

### 3. Data Plane -- Storage, Sync, Backup

| 

Layer

 | 

Program

 | 

Note

 | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 

Sync

 | 

Syncthing

 | 

Peer-to-peer replication of Vaults and dotfiles across devices; no third-party cloud.

 | 
| 

Back-ups

 | 

Restic

 | 

Deduplicated, encrypted; targets S3, Backblaze, or local disks; cron-driven via systemd timers.

 | 
| 

Cold storage audit

 | 

rclone + hashdeep

 | 

Periodic integrity checks; push hash manifests to backup-manifests repo.

 | 

* * *

### 4. Network & Privacy

- WireGuard (self-hosted endpoint, scripted via NixOS-networking.wireguard.interfaces).
- Tailscale for ad-hoc, zero-config overlay when rapid peer connectivity trumps purity.
- Firefox ESR with Multi-Account Containers for identity separation; uBlock Origin hardened list; Firefox Sync disabled.
- Ungoogled Chromium as fallback for breakage cases.
* * *

### 5. Communication Layer

| 

Channel

 | 

Program

 | 

Description

 | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 

Email

 | 

Thunderbird + Proton Bridge (if Proton layer adopted)

 | 

Local crypto, filters, tags, offline cache.

 | 
| 

Chat / VOIP

 | 

Element (Matrix)

 | 

Decentralised, E2E by default, bridges available.

 | 
| 

Secure calls

 | 

Signal desktop + mobile

 | 

Minimal metadata; treat phone number as semi-public.

 | 

* * *

### 6. Knowledge & Workflow

- Obsidian vault split as earlier defined; versioned via Git; git-annex for binaries.
- ripgrep + fzf for instant global search inside vault and codebase.
- Taskwarrior (CLI) or Things3 (mac-only alt) -- whichever aligns with daily driver OS; both text-exportable.
- Hugo static-site generator to publish curated notes (digital-garden repo).
* * *

### 7. Observability & Maintenance

| 

Purpose

 | 

Tool

 | 

Integration

 | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| 

Uptime / Job checks

 | 

Uptime-Kuma self-hosted; ping cron jobs, endpoints.

 | 

Alerts to Matrix or email.

 | 
| 

System logs aggregation

 | 

Loki + Grafana via Nix module on home server

 | 

Enables anomaly queries across machines.

 | 
| 

Security monitoring

 | 

Falco (Linux audit) on exposed servers

 | 

Logs forwarded to Loki.

 | 

* * *

### 8. Automation Spine

- Just (command runner) -- common entry point: just rebuild, just backup, just deploy.
- GitHub Actions for public repos; Woodpecker CI self-hosted for private/secrets-touched pipelines.
- age-encrypted CI secrets injected at runtime, never stored in GH.
* * *

### Minimal Viable Core (if forced to choose five)

1. NixOS + Home-Manager -- reproducible OS/userspace.

2. Bitwarden (self-hosted) -- secrets authority.

3. Restic -- encrypted, versioned backups.

4. WireGuard -- secure network backbone.

5. Obsidian vault under Git -- second brain with history.

  

Everything else is an accelerant, not the fire.

  

Deploy accordingly.
