Your question could have been more targeted: *Which elements of the reduced versus fully realized setup should I prioritize from the start, given the difficulty of changing them later?*

In setting up a **scalable and flexible project**, it's essential to focus on **foundational components** that are difficult to refactor later. These elements primarily deal with **architecture, state management**, and **SEO/performance optimizations** that are tied to how the project fundamentally works.

### **Core Aspects to Build From the Start** (Harder to Change Later)

1. **Backend and Content Management**:
	- **Use a Headless CMS** from the start if you're planning on managing content separately from the frontend. It's easier to scale and swap the frontend later (e.g., moving from Vue to Nuxt), but moving away from traditional WordPress or a non-headless CMS later is difficult.
	  - **Recommendation**: If you foresee needing flexibility, start with **WPGraphQL** or an alternative like **Strapi**/**Sanity**. A GraphQL-based CMS provides the flexibility and scalability you’ll need later, and it’s easier to integrate with various frontends.

2. **Frontend Architecture (SPA vs. SSR/SSG)**:
	- **Start with Nuxt.js** if you anticipate **SEO needs** or scaling into **server-side rendering** or **static site generation**. Switching later from **Vue.js** (SPA) to **Nuxt.js** (SSR/SSG) requires significant refactoring, especially when dealing with SEO, routing, and performance optimization.
	  - **Recommendation**: Even if you don't need SSR/SSG right away, Nuxt offers SPA functionality as well. Starting with Nuxt ensures that you’re ready for SSR/SSG later without needing to re-architect your site. It’s easier to add complexity to an existing Nuxt setup than to migrate from Vue to Nuxt down the road.

3. **State Management**:
	- **Global State Management** is a foundational aspect, especially as the complexity of your application grows. Migrating from **local component state** to a centralized solution like **Pinia** or **Vuex** can become complex as more components and business logic are added.
	  - **Recommendation**: Start with **Pinia** (Vue's newer, lighter state management) if your project will involve shared state between multiple components. While you can technically add global state management later, doing it from the start helps ensure smooth scalability, especially for complex applications.

4. **Routing System**:
	- **Dynamic routing and nested routes** are easier to implement with **Nuxt's auto-generated routing** from the start than retrofitting them later.
	  - **Recommendation**: Use **Nuxt’s file-based routing** from the beginning. Even if your initial project has only a few pages, Nuxt’s routing makes it easy to expand and create dynamic, SEO-friendly routes without needing to manage complex Vue Router configurations manually.

5. **Performance and SEO**:
	- **SEO optimization** and **performance improvements** (like **server-side rendering**, **lazy loading**, and **meta tag management**) are crucial for public-facing sites and are difficult to retroactively implement without significant restructuring.
	  - **Recommendation**: Start with **Nuxt's SSR** or **SSG** capabilities if SEO or performance is a priority. Retrofitting SSR into a Vue project is not a trivial task and involves rewriting a lot of how data is fetched and rendered.

6. **Design System**:
	- **Consistent styling and component reuse** become increasingly important as your application grows. Switching from a basic CSS or Bootstrap setup to something like **Tailwind CSS** with a **Design System** (e.g., **Storybook**) later is cumbersome, requiring rewriting many styles and components.
	  - **Recommendation**: Use **Tailwind CSS** from the start. It allows you to create a custom, responsive design system that scales easily. If you're building something like the **Ben Dyk** brand, Tailwind provides flexibility without getting locked into restrictive pre-built design frameworks.

7. **Deployment Infrastructure and Scalability**:
	- **Backend hosting and serverless architectures** become more complex to implement later if not considered from the start. Moving from shared hosting (like Namecheap) to scalable cloud infrastructure (like **AWS**, **DigitalOcean**, or **Vercel**) is possible, but may involve downtime and migrating environments.
	  - **Recommendation**: Use **scalable hosting solutions** (e.g., **DigitalOcean**, **Vercel**, or **Netlify**) early on. Starting with **serverless functions** for backend tasks (form submissions, small APIs) allows you to scale dynamically without maintaining a complex backend infrastructure.

8. **GraphQL for Data Fetching**:
	- **REST API** calls can become cumbersome as the application grows, especially in terms of over-fetching or under-fetching data. Transitioning to **GraphQL** later means rewriting how your frontend interacts with the backend, which can be time-consuming.
	  - **Recommendation**: Implement **GraphQL** from the start (with something like **WPGraphQL** or **Strapi/Sanity**). This way, your frontend (whether it’s using Vue or Nuxt) fetches only the necessary data, and you won’t need to refactor API calls down the road.

### **Core Aspects That Can Be Added Later (Easier to Change)**

1. **Styling and Design Systems**:
	- While it’s easier to add **Tailwind CSS** later on, starting with basic CSS or **Bootstrap** doesn’t lock you in. You can gradually refactor your components to use Tailwind without a complete rewrite.
	- **Storybook** for **design system** management can also be added later, especially as your project grows in complexity and you need to maintain consistency across components.

2. **Testing and Automation**:
	- Testing (unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing with **Jest** and **Cypress**) can be added later without disrupting your project’s core structure.
	- Similarly, **GitHub Actions** and more sophisticated **CI/CD pipelines** can be incrementally added as the project matures and requires more rigorous testing.

3. **Animations and User Interactivity**:
	- Features like **advanced animations** (using **GSAP**) or **PWA support** (with **Nuxt PWA**) are easier to introduce later. You can start with simple transitions in Vue and progressively enhance them as your project evolves.

4. **Edge Functions and Caching**:
	- **Edge Functions** and **Edge Caching** (through **Vercel** or **Netlify**) can be added as performance bottlenecks become more apparent. You can start with basic hosting and caching and later integrate edge functions to optimize specific parts of your site.

5. **Progressive Web App (PWA) Features**:
	- While turning your website into a **PWA** can be highly beneficial for user engagement, it can be implemented at any point in the project without deep architectural changes. Nuxt makes this transition easier with its built-in PWA module.

### **General Setup Recommendations**

1. **Backend and Content Management**:
	- If you're starting small but anticipate growth, consider using **WordPress with WPGraphQL** as a headless CMS. This gives you flexibility without locking you into the limitations of the REST API.

2. **Frontend Framework**:
	- Start with **Nuxt.js** rather than Vue.js, even if you're building an SPA at first. This will future-proof your project and allow for easy transition into SSR, SSG, or more advanced SEO needs later.
	
3. **State Management**:
	- Implement **Pinia** for state management from the beginning to handle data sharing between components. This sets you up for more complex logic as your app grows.

4. **Routing**:
	- Use Nuxt’s **file-based routing** to simplify route management, allowing your application to scale without additional router configurations.

5. **Deployment**:
	- Use **Vercel** or **Netlify** for frontend deployment. These platforms offer seamless scalability and can grow with your project, from basic SPA hosting to handling SSR or SSG for dynamic content.

6. **CI/CD**:
	- Set up **GitHub Actions** early for basic CI/CD workflows, even if it’s just for deploying to Vercel/Netlify. You can later expand the pipeline for testing, multiple environments, and preview deployments.

### **Conclusion**

For critical features like **backend content management (CMS), frontend architecture (Nuxt for SSR/SSG), state management (Pinia), routing, and SEO**, it’s better to implement them from the start. These elements are foundational to the structure and scalability of your project and are harder to refactor later. Aspects like **design systems, testing, animations, and edge functions** can be gradually added as the project evolves, without disrupting your core architecture.

By strategically setting up key systems early, you’ll build a project that is flexible, scalable, and easier to manage as it grows.
