### 1. Command Architecture

| Layer | Purpose | Key Mechanisms | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Sovereign Board (you + one external advisor)** | Capital allocation, strategic reset every 90 days | 2-hour quarterly meeting, agenda pre-circulated | 
| **Operating Commit (weekly, 45 min)** | Prioritise projects, unblock ops cells | Use a single Notion kanban sorted by ROI / cycle time | 
| **Cell Leads (contractors, 1099 / Werkvertrag)** | Autonomous fulfilment inside fixed SOP | Paid per deliverable, replaced if SLA missed twice | 

Ownership: 100 % founder. Create a phantom-equity pool (10 %) for future senior operators; vests on EBIT milestones, not time.

* * *

### 2. Capital Flow Protocol

| Source | Allocation Rule | Trigger | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Tier 1 net cash (Ops cells) | 50 % reinvest in cell growth, 30 % to Core Treasury buffer, 20 % venture reserve | Automatic on invoice collection | 
| Tier 2 profit | 40 % retained in business, 60 % up-streamed as dividend to Treasury | Quarterly close | 
| Venture Reserve | Deploy only into Tier 2 prototypes or Tier 3 pre-seed; max €25 k per bet | Approved in Board | 

No external capital until a Tier 2 line posts ≥€20 k MRR for three consecutive months.

* * *

### 3. Venture Funnel

| Stage | Gate Criteria | Allowed Spend | Decision Owner | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **Idea Intake** | Clear pain, reachable buyer, ≤30-day prototype path | €0 | You | 
| **Proof Sprint (≤14 days)** | First paying user or LoI | ≤€2 k | You | 
| **Hustle Live** | ≥€2 k gross, ≥50 % margin, zero churn after 30 days | ≤€5 k | Operating Commit | 
| **Scale Cell (Tier 2)** | ≥€10 k monthly, process documented, contractor capacity in place | ≥€5 k ≤€25 k | Board | 
| **Startup Vector (Tier 3)** | TAM > €100 m, moat identified, lead user signed | Case-by-case | Board + external advisor | 

Kill rule: any project that fails to advance a stage within two cycles is shut, assets recycled.

* * *

### 4. Metrics Stack (single Notion DB)

| Metric | Frequency | Target | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Cash runway (Treasury) | Weekly | ≥6 months | 
| Tier 1 blended margin | Monthly | ≥55 % | 
| Tier 1 utilisation (hours founder) | Weekly | ≤20 h | 
| Tier 2 revenue concentration (top-3 clients) | Quarterly | ≤40 % | 
| Lead-to-close for service offers | Monthly | ≤10 days | 
| Prototype cycle time (idea → invoice) | Rolling | ≤21 days | 

Dashboard autopopulated via Zapier from Stripe and Airtable.

### 5. Talent & Contract Grid

| Role | Source | SLA | Replacement lead-time | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Framer / Astro dev | Upwork shortlist of 3 | 5-day delivery window | 48 h | 
| Motion designer | Eastern-EU boutique | 7-day window | 72 h | 
| Copy lead | DE native freelancer | 2-day turnaround | 24 h | 

Maintain redundancy: two contractors per critical competence. No retainer until workload >50 % capacity.

* * *

### 6. Systems Stack

- **Single source**: Notion database for projects, SOP, CRM
- **Finance**: Qonto + SevDesk auto-sync, weekly reconciliation
- **Comms**: Gmail, Telegram group per cell, async Loom updates
- **Workflow**: Kanban status triggers Zapier events for invoices, doc hand-offs, client updates
- **Knowledge repo**: Obsidian vault mirrored to S3 nightly
* * *

### 7. Risk & Compliance

- Client NDAs standard. Liability capped at project fee.
- Professional indemnity insurance €1 m.
- All AI processing routed through EU datacentres (Hetzner, OVH) to pre-empt data-sovereignty objections.
- GDPR: Data-processing agreements signed with each contractor.
- Kill-switch SOP: if a contractor breaches SLA twice, credentials revoked in 30 minutes via 1Password admin.

### 8. Annual Roadmap (time-in-months)

| Month | Output | 
| ---- | ----  |
| 0--1 | Launch WebOps, VisualOps offers, close 4 pilot projects | 
| 2 | Implement full metrics dashboard, hit €5 k net cash buffer | 
| 3 | Add DataOps offer, first bundled "Founder Launch Kit" | 
| 4--5 | Validate one Tier 2 prototype (ComplyKit) to €10 k MRR run-rate | 
| 6 | Board review: decide on external advisor equity grant | 
| 7--8 | Systemise Ops handbook v2, reduce founder ops hours to <15/week | 
| 9 | Second Tier 2 line (RecruitFlow) live, cross-sell from ComplyKit base | 
| 10--12 | Treasury ≥€60 k, assess first Tier 3 candidate against funnel gates | 

* * *

### 9. Hard Constraints

- **Founder time budget:** 45 h/week absolute ceiling.  
Allocation guideline: 40 % sales, 30 % system design, 20 % product thinking, 10 % admin.

- **Project limit:** Maximum 6 concurrent client projects across all cells until first full-time operator hired.

This framework keeps Eupator strategic, capital-efficient, and founder-light. Everything else is noise.
