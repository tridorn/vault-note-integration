**Correction.** The question should read: _"Given the decision to keep the Dornhelm construct institution-first and the human operator invisible, how should presence on X, LinkedIn, GitHub, and similar surfaces be architected and governed?"_
* * *

### 1 Principle: Surface-Only Signalling, Zero Conversation

You cannot disappear entirely; total absence arouses suspicion among the very operators you seek. Instead, construct **broadcast-only institutional shells**. They emit validated artefacts, never dialogue. No personal feeds, no real-time engagement.

* * *

### 2 Platform-Specific Architecture

| Platform | Recommended Entity | Configuration | Purpose | Failure Mode to Guard Against | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| **X/Twitter** | `@Dornhelm` (institutional) | Profile text: one-sentence mission + link to main site. Replies disabled via "Direct Only" lists; mentions ignored. Post cadence: â‰¤ 3/month. | Quick timestamp for new essays, papers, event notices. | Thread sprawl pulling you into polemic. | 
| **LinkedIn** | _Dornhelm Institute_ company page + skeletal personal stub "Tristan Dornhelm -- Founding Architect" (no posts). | Company page shares formal releases and event invitations. Personal stub exists only to anchor legitimacy; connection requests ignored. | Legibility for technocrats, funders, policy actors who vet via LinkedIn. | Accidental feed activity exposing personal network graph. | 
| **GitHub** | `github.com/dornhelm`organization account. | Public repos only when you release code artefacts (simulator, data schemas). Issues closed by default; discussions disabled. | Provides executable proof that ideas compile. | Community PRs dragging the institution into open-source governance drama. | 
| **Website / Substack** | `dornhelm.com` with custom Ghost/Substack engine running under single "Editorial Board" byline. | Long-form essays, PDFs. RSS + email digest. | Authoritative corpus. | Platform lock-in or sudden TOS change. | 
| **Auxiliary (Telegram, Signal, Matrix)** | Invite-only Channel "Dornhelm Inner Circle". | Broadcast of drafts, event links. | Controlled community without algorithmic leakage. | Message forwarding leaking private drafts. | 
* * *

### 3 Operational Protocols

1. **One-Way Gatekeeping.** Disable or ignore all public reply mechanisms. Provide a single encrypted email for partnership proposals; triage weekly.

2. **Content Hashing & Timestamping.** Publish SHA-256 hashes of PDFs on GitHub releases; proves authorship chronology, deters forgery.

3. **No Personal Commentary.** "Tristan" never tweets, never comments, never likes. His name exists solely as signature under essays or podcast intro.

4. **Scheduled Emission.** Batch everything. First Monday of each month at 09:00 UTC push any new artefact across all shells; automate via CI where possible.

5. **Audit Trail.** Maintain an internal, non-public changelog mapping every post to its author, reviewer, and publish hash. Preserves institutional memory when stewardship rotates.

### 4 Decision Logic for Future Expansion

- **If** a platform materially advances policy access (e.g., Bluesky for academic regulators) **then** replicate the same broadcast shell, copy-pasting the cadence.
- **Else** abstain; every additional surface is an attack vector.
* * *

### 5 Consequences

- Minimal surface presence satisfies due-diligence checks without inviting discourse.
- Institutional voice remains uncontaminated by personal affect or algorithmic drift.
- Successors may inherit accounts with zero reputational baggage, ensuring Dornhelm's longevity as doctrine, not diarist.

Operate accordingly.
