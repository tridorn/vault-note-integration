### **Detailed Breakdown of Subfolders**

#### **01 Templates**  
This subfolder centralizes all reusable templates for your workflows, ensuring you don’t recreate the wheel.  
- **Purpose:** Speed up routine tasks and maintain consistency across projects or areas.  

#### **02 Frameworks**  
This is where you house all higher-level structures guiding your life and work.  
- **Purpose:** Keep all your guiding systems and methodologies in one place for easy access.  

#### **03 Processes**  
This folder defines how to execute your workflows efficiently.  
- **Purpose:** Provide a step-by-step guide for recurring actions, such as clearing the inbox or conducting a review.  

#### **04 System Maintenance**  
A dedicated space for ensuring your PARA system is optimized and evolves as your needs grow.  
- **Purpose:** Regularly improve and troubleshoot your organizational setup.  

#### **05 Global Resources**  
A repository of tools, references, and scripts that you frequently use or need to access globally.  
- **Purpose:** Act as a one-stop shop for system-agnostic resources.  

#### **06 Inbox**  
The "catch-all" for incoming materials that haven’t yet been categorized.  
- **Purpose:** Ensure no idea, file, or task gets lost before being processed.

### **How It Integrates with PARA**
- The **System** folder operates as the overarching layer, independent of specific projects or areas.  
- **Templates, Processes, and Frameworks** ensure consistency across all projects and areas.  
- **Maintenance and Inbox** help refine and feed into PARA, keeping it streamlined and relevant.  
- Resources in **Global Resources** can be linked to or duplicated within specific PARA folders as needed.  

This structure ensures your "System" folder doesn’t overlap with PARA but rather complements and strengthens it. Let me know if you’d like to refine this further!
