### **Steps For Developing the Documentation**

1. **Planning and Outlining**:
	- Start by creating a detailed outline of the document structure (similar to the one above).
	- Involve stakeholders from each part of the organization (Leadership Council, LFOs, AMU Leaders) to get input on the most critical areas that need clarification.

2. **Creating Core Content**:
	- Draft sections one by one, starting with the **high-level overview** and working down to more detailed **operational guidelines**.
	- Use consistent terminology (Objectives, Key Results, Missions, KPIs) throughout the document to avoid confusion.

3. **Collaborative Review**:
	- After drafting, collaborate with different teams for **feedback** to ensure the document is clear and practical.
	- Include real-world examples from your company to make the abstract concepts more relatable.

4. **Design and Formatting**:
	- Create a **visually clean and organized** document with headings, subheadings, and bullet points for easy navigation.
	- Include **diagrams or flowcharts** to visually explain complex processes like the interaction between Leadership, LFOs, and AMUs.

5. **Digital Version**:
	- Publish the documentation in a digital format (PDF, intranet, or internal wiki) to allow for **easy access** and **searchability** by team members.
	- Ensure it's easily updateable to reflect changes in processes as the company evolves.

By following this structure, you’ll create a well-organized, thorough documentation that serves as a **living document** for the AMU system. This will ensure that everyone, from new hires to executives, has a clear understanding of how the company operates within this dynamic structure.
