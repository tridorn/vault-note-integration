### The **Interrogatory Backbone** of a Persuasive Value Narrative  
*Answer each block in sequence; if any answer is thin or evasive, your story fractures.*

| Logical Block | Core Question (exact wording to force precision) | Why It Must Be Answered (Strategic Leverage) |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **1. Status-Quo Pain Audit** | *“Which irreducible frictions cost the SME/Vendor/Bank ≥ X % of deal value or ≥ Y days?”* | Quantifies baseline loss; gives your uplift a denominator. |
| **2. Stakeholder Incentive Map** | *“How does each actor’s P&L, KPI, or regulatory exposure change if friction disappears?”* | Converts abstract pain into agenda-moving urgency. |
| **3. Critical Path Bottleneck** | *“Which single hand-off or verification gate dominates total cycle time?”* | Focuses narrative on one villain; the rest become collateral wins. |
| **4. Unique Mechanism of Action** | *“What structural capability do we possess that incumbents cannot cheaply copy within 12 months?”* | Frames defensibility; inoculates against ‘why you?’ objections. |
| **5. Quantified Delta** | *“What is the minimum, evidence-backed %-improvement we can guarantee on cost, time, or risk?”* | Supplies the hard promise; the story’s monetary headline. |
| **6. Proof Vector** | *“Which real transaction, executed concierge-style, demonstrates that delta end-to-end?”* | Grounds the claim; converts concept into observable fact. |
| **7. Economic Flywheel** | *“How does each additional opportunity lower marginal cost or raise network advantage?”* | Signals scalability; investors and partners smell compounding returns. |
| **8. Compliance Edge** | *“How does our event-sourced, facet-sealed ledger pre-empt future regulatory audits?”* | Turns a cost centre into a sales feature; reassures the bank and regulator. |
| **9. Risk Containment** | *“What are the catastrophic failure modes and what contractual or data safeguards neutralise them?”* | Shows command of downside; Machiavellian prudence. |
| **10. Monetisation Logic** | *“Who writes the cheque, out of which budget line, and why is that line least price-elastic?”* | Anchors revenue reality; avoids ‘hope is not a business model’. |
| **11. Road-to-Production Plan** | *“What are the three irreversible milestones that convert manual MVP into automated platform at < €Z burn?”* | Demonstrates disciplined capital allocation; assuages dilution fears. |
| **12. Strategic Escape Hatch** | *“If green-credit stalls, which adjacent vertical can the Opportunity aggregate penetrate with ≤ 20 % retool?”* | Proves option value; futureproofs narrative against market shocks. |

#### How to Use  
1. **Interrogate yourself ruthlessly**—write one paragraph per question.  
2. **Sequence the paragraphs into a storyline**: *Pain → Delta → Proof → Flywheel → Monetisation → Risk Containment → Optionality.*  
3. **Strip sentimentality**—every claim backed by metric or concrete pilot evidence.  

Answer these twelve questions with numerical and documentary support; the result **is** your value-creation narrative—airtight, investor-grade, and stakeholder-compelling.
