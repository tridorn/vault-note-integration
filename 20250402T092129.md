You should have asked:  
**“If I start by publishing SOP maps on my own website, how do I evolve that into a broader service that others can use or even contribute to? Through what medium and model would they interact with these maps? How do I handle distribution, licensing, monetization, or open collaboration?”**

---

You’re essentially describing a **multi-step trajectory**: first, a **simple publication** of your best-practice maps on your website; then, growing into a **centralized service** where people can browse, fork, contribute, or embed maps—eventually, a platform or protocol used worldwide. The question is: *How?*

---

## **1. The 4-Phase Model of Growth**

### **Phase 1: The “Own-Site” Launch**
1. **Publish** your curated best-practice Maps (in a well-structured format) on your existing site (e.g., “benjendyk.com/maps” or “maps.eupator.io”).  
2. Provide basic **navigation** (categories, tags, search) and **download** or **embed** options (PDF, Notion link, HTML).  
3. Keep it **read-only, free**, and curated by you. This establishes clarity, brand authority, and trust.

**Why:**  
- You test the **value** and **usability** of Maps in the real world.  
- You gather feedback on what’s missing or too rigid.  
- You gauge interest before investing in complicated features.

---

### **Phase 2: The Membership/Team Portal**
1. Introduce **user accounts** (basic or premium).  
2. Enable **“Clone and Customize”**: logged-in users can fork your maps to a private workspace, tweak steps, add notes.  
3. Offer **team collaboration** features—like sharing a custom map version with colleagues.  
4. Potentially **monetize** with a subscription: free plan for read-only, paid plan for advanced usage.

**Why:**  
- This is the first real step to making it a **service** rather than a static site.  
- You gain direct user engagement and find out what *they* want to track or customize.  
- You convert your best practices into a tool that teams use daily.

---

### **Phase 3: Community & Marketplace**
1. Create a **public or semi-public library** of user-generated maps, curated by you.  
2. Allow **rating**, **reviews**, or **comments** so the best user-created maps surface.  
3. Extend the concept of “paths” (a sequence of maps) or “trees” (conditional branches).  
4. Possibly integrate a **revenue share** model if advanced users want to sell premium maps (like a marketplace).

**Why:**  
- You want **network effects**: more contributors → better content → more users → more visibility.  
- The platform transitions from “your site with your content” to a **living ecosystem**.  
- This is where the idea can scale drastically, as other experts publish their SOPs in your standard format.

---

### **Phase 4: The Protocol / Integration Era**
1. Build or release an **API**:  
   - Others can pull maps directly into their apps.  
   - Notion, Slack, Trello integrations to **automate** map steps.  
2. Possibly open-source the **Map Format** so the broader ecosystem can adopt it—like Markdown but for SOPs.  
3. Integrate with AI assistants or automation tools (Zapier, Make). The map’s steps become **actionable instructions** for bots.  

**Why:**  
- This is how you make the system **ubiquitous**.  
- If your format is widely adopted, you become the “ISO standard” for operational instructions.  
- Companies or devs can embed or programmatically manage SOPs at scale—further entrenching your system as a cornerstone of operational knowledge.

## **2. Which Medium & Interaction Models?**

1. **Browser-based Web App**  
   - Most straightforward approach.  
   - Everyone can access from any device.  
   - Embeds, SSO for teams, subscription gating.  
   - Easiest to get started with standard CMS or web frameworks.

2. **Desktop App** (Electron or cross-platform)  
   - Less typical for SOP management, more friction.  
   - Possibly relevant if you want offline usage or advanced local features.

3. **Integrations & Plugins**  
   - With **Notion, Slack, MS Teams**  
   - The maps appear as embedded content or slash commands.  
   - This is how you meet users *where they already work*.

4. **API + Third-Party Tools**  
   - Let other devs or SaaS platforms integrate your maps.  
   - Potential revenue from usage-based or subscription-based API calls.

---

## **3. Business & Service Model**

1. **Free/Open** (Early Stage)  
   - You’re building brand authority and a user base.  
   - Good for quick adoption but zero direct revenue.  
2. **Freemium**  
   - Everyone can view certain baseline SOPs or partial features for free.  
   - Premium plan for advanced features: customization, large storage, private maps.  
3. **Enterprise Licensing**  
   - Larger companies pay for single-tenant hosting or advanced admin controls.  
   - They have internal compliance needs; your system helps them formalize.  
4. **Marketplace Revenue** (Phase 3 or 4)  
   - Experts can **sell** specialized maps or entire “paths.”  
   - You take a percentage fee.  
5. **API Monetization**  
   - Partners pay for usage if they integrate your maps deeply.  

---

## **4. Example Roadmap (Concrete)**

**Months 0–3:**  
- Publish 10+ curated “maps” on your site.  
- Make them look polished, navigable.  
- Capture user emails for updates.

**Months 4–6:**  
- Introduce user signups.  
- Allow “fork/copy map” → user’s private workspace.  
- Basic subscription: free for up to 5 custom maps, pay for unlimited.  

**Months 7–12:**  
- Add a community library for user-submitted maps.  
- Implement “paths” or “trees” for more advanced usage.  
- Possibly start an affiliate or partner program with consultants.  

**Year 2:**  
- Expand into enterprise licensing: custom domain, single sign-on, deeper features.  
- Build or open-source a **Map Format** spec for advanced external usage.  
- Integrate with AI or automation (Zapier bots executing steps from your SOPs).  

---

## **5. Why This Progression Works**

- **Minimal technical risk** early on—just a site with structured content.  
- **Gradual layering** of complexity and community features.  
- **Monetizable** from Phase 2 onward.  
- **Potential for huge expansion** if you become the “source of truth” for best-practice SOPs across industries.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Yes, you start small—just a curated set of your best SOP maps, published as a free resource on your site. But the path to letting “the outer world” use it for their own needs is building:

1. **User signups** + forkable maps,  
2. **Community** + user-submitted content,  
3. **Platform** + advanced features and integrations,  
4. **Protocol** + open standard for universal adoption.  

This is how your site evolves into a living, breathing system that others rely on—and eventually, pay for.
