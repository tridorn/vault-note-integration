It sounds like you've got a richly detailed concept for this world and this magical, crystalline race. I think there are some things that need to be addressed to make it more cohesive.

1. **Origin of Minerals and Magic Lines:** Instead of the minerals being "crystallized magic", you could consider them as conductive materials that naturally formed in this world, which the magic lines are naturally attracted to. Magic, in this case, could be an inherent force of this world, like gravity or magnetism. Over the millennia, these minerals and magic lines interact, resulting in the formation of the insulars.

2. **Ability Growth:** If these beings are formed from magic, perhaps their ability to use different types of magic comes from exposure and experience. Like learning a language or a skill, the more they use a certain type of magic or interact with others who do, the more proficient they become. This would allow them to grow and develop in a variety of directions based on their experiences and needs.

3. **Communication and Community:** Your concept of a hive-like mind is interesting. To make it more feasible, consider a kind of telepathic network. When in close proximity, these beings can share thoughts and feelings directly. The insulars, being hubs of magic and mineral lines, could act as amplifiers or hubs, allowing communication across greater distances. This would explain why they need to inhabit these insulars, and why their power and communication abilities are limited outside of them.

4. **Economy and Society:** Their communal, hive-like society would indeed operate much like a single organism, with each member fulfilling a needed role. Their external economic activities could be driven by their need for more resources, both to sustain their society and to expand their reach through the creation of more avatars and insulars. This would make them both traders and colonizers, seeking to claim more and more of the world's resources for their insulars.

5. **Portals:** The idea of them altering the insulars to create portals is intriguing. This could be a high-level magical ability that only the most skilled among them can perform, making it a valuable and strategic skill. It would allow them to quickly move resources and members between insulars, effectively making their scattered insulars into one interconnected network.

I hope these suggestions help to further refine your world-building!
