You could have stated: "I want a tightly curated, high-impact reading sequence for the first weeks of my entrepreneurial preparation, optimised for rapid prototyping and independent MVP development, with about three and a half days allocated per book."

  

Here is a rationally structured initial sequence, focused on compressing critical entrepreneurial competencies into the shortest viable timeframe. This avoids over-investing in topics that only become relevant once you scale beyond the initial solo-prototyping stage.

  

Week 1: Strategic Orientation and Mental Models

1. The Lean Startup -- Eric Ries

Establishes the operational rhythm of hypothesis testing, iteration, and market feedback loops.

2. The Mom Test -- Rob Fitzpatrick

Hardens customer discovery practices and inoculates against self-delusion in early feedback collection.

  

Week 2: Product-Market Fit and Prototyping

3. Sprint -- Jake Knapp

Codifies a five-day approach to designing, prototyping, and testing with customers.

4. Hooked -- Nir Eyal

A framework for embedding user-retention mechanics into MVPs from day one.

  

Week 3: Business Model Mechanics

5. Business Model Generation -- Alexander Osterwalder & Yves Pigneur

A visual system for mapping and stress-testing business models quickly.

6. Blue Ocean Strategy -- W. Chan Kim & Ren√©e Mauborgne

Identifies high-leverage positioning opportunities by reframing competitive landscapes.

  

Week 4: Executional Discipline

7. The E-Myth Revisited -- Michael Gerber

Teaches the necessity of systematisation even in micro-scale operations.

8. Measure What Matters -- John Doerr

Introduces OKRs as a compact performance management tool for a solo founder.

  

This sequence moves from mindset to tactical skills, then to strategic modelling, and finally to operational discipline. It is front-loaded with the books that can be directly applied in your prototyping experiments, while deferring scaling-focused works until you have validated your core value proposition.

  

If you want, I can produce the subsequent eight-week reading arc to ensure you don't fall into diminishing returns after this initial momentum phase.
