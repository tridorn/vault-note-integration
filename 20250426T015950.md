## **IV. Tactical Execution Details**

### **A. Direct Outreach Protocol**

1. **Target Building**  
   - FirmenWissen / NorthData searches: filter by revenue size, sector, owner visible.
   - Build Airtable CRM: Company, Owner name, Estimated Age, Contact info.

2. **Outreach Flow**  
   - Hand-written style letter →  
   - Wait 10 business days →  
   - Follow-up call →  
   - Email re-introduction if no response.

3. **Message Positioning**  
   - **Primary Frame**: *Preserve your life's work + steward your people.*  
   - **Secondary Frame**: *Modernise governance and execution without destroying your culture.*

4. **First Meeting Script** (Discovery mode only):
   - Personal journey of founder
   - Succession fears and wishes
   - Business strength and challenges
   - No discussion of valuation or deal terms at first meeting.

### **B. Broker Engagement Protocol**

1. **Selection**

3. **Follow-up Discipline**  
   - Bi-weekly reminder to brokers: "Send everything < €10m EBITDA fitting [profile]."
   - Fast (≤48h) IM response (yes/no).

4. **Relationship Building**
