### V. Governance & Review Mechanisms

#### 1 Review Rituals -- compulsory checkpoints

| Tier | Event | Cadence | Participants | Core Docket | Binding Artefact | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Cell / Squad | Sprint Retro | End-of-Sprint | Cell Lead (CE/SQ) + FO | Throughput, defect list, morale pulse | Sprint Report | 
| Mission | Mission Mid-Point | Week 4 (6-wk Mission) or Week 6 (12-wk) | Mission Cmdr, FO, PRJ Owner | KPI variance, scope drift, risk heat-map | Mission Scorecard | 
| Program | Program Board | Monthly | PGM Dir, CMP Sponsor, SD Leads, FO Rep | Cross-project dependencies, budget absorption, resourcing forecast | Program Dashboard | 
| Campaign | Portfolio Review | Quarterly | SO Chief, Campaign Sponsors, Council Delegates | Strategic fit, capital burn rate, pivot/terminate proposals | Campaign Scorecard | 
| Portfolio | Annual Summit | Fiscal year close | Full Council, SO Chiefs, External Auditor | Capital re-allocation, doctrine gaps, systemic risk | Portfolio Review Deck | 

_Time-box rule: if agenda overruns, unresolved items escalate automatically to the next tier._

* * *

#### 2 Performance Model -- quantitative + qualitative gauges

| Unit | Primary Metrics | Secondary Metrics | Review Owner | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Cell / Squad | Velocity (story pts / Sprint); Defect escape rate | Morale index (FO survey) | Mission Cmdr | 
| Mission | Objective completion %; Cycle-time adherence | Stakeholder NPS; Cost-to-Value ratio | Program Dir | 
| Project | Budget variance ≤ ±5 %; Deliverable acceptance rate | Risk backlog age | Program Dir | 
| Program | Aggregate KPI delta vs target | Resource utilisation | Campaign Sponsor | 
| Campaign | Strategic milestone attainment | Capital efficiency (ROI) | SO Chief | 
| Support Division | SLA compliance ≥ 95 % | Internal customer sat score | SD Lead | 
| Intelligence Hub | Brief accuracy; Alert latency | Decision uptake rate | IH Director | 

Metric definitions are codified in the _Performance Lexicon_; amendments require Council vote.

#### 3 Escalation Protocols -- when autonomy stops

| Trigger | ≤ 24 h Handler | 24--48 h Escalation | > 48 h Escalation | Final Arbiter | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Resource deadlock | FO | SD Lead | SO Logistics | Council Finance Seat | 
| Scope-time collision | Mission Cmdr | Program Dir | Campaign Sponsor | SO Chief | 
| KPI degradation > 20 % | Program Dir | Campaign Sponsor | SO Chief | Council | 
| Security / legal breach | SD Legal | SO Chief | Council | External Board | 

Each step must produce a _Decision Log_ entry citing options considered and chosen mitigation.

#### 4 Doctrine Evolution -- controlled mutation of the kernel

1. **Trigger Conditions**

    - KPI divergence > 20 % sustained across two review cycles.

    - External regulatory or market shock judged _Priority-α_ by IH.

    - Retrospective consensus at any tier that doctrine impedes objectives.

2. **Process**

    1. SO Doctrine Cell drafts _Amendment Proposal_.

    2. Circulation for comment: 5 bd across FO cohort, SD leads, Program Directors.

    3. Council plenary vote (simple majority).

    4. Version tag incremented (major for structural change, minor for clarification).

    5. Mandatory briefings: Mission Commanders (within 10 bd), all SD units (within 15 bd).

3. **Sunset Rule**  
Any doctrine clause unreferenced in artefacts or rituals for 18 months is flagged for removal review.

* * *

#### 5 Compliance & Audit

- **Continuous Audit Bot** ingests artefacts, verifies naming, timestamp, and checksum fields; non-compliance notifications routed to FO and SO Audit cell.
- **Semi-Annual Field Audit** led by SO Audit: random sample of Missions and SD tickets; findings logged in _Governance Ledger_.
- **Penalty Matrix**: repeated non-compliance (> 3 infractions in 90 days) triggers mandatory root-cause workshop; systemic negligence escalates to Council disciplinary panel.

These mechanisms seal the system: fixed rituals enforce rhythm, metrics expose variance, escalations inject speed, doctrine governance preserves coherence, and audit loops inoculate against entropy.
