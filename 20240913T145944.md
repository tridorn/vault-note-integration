# Seemingly irrational things

Your question, reformulated for greater clarity, might be: *"How does Stoicism view seemingly irrational or emotionally driven behaviors, such as cheering for one's favorite sports team or engaging in playful, childish behavior with a partner? Can such actions coexist with a Stoic pursuit of rationality and virtue?"*

In Stoicism, *rationality* is the supreme guiding principle, as it allows us to align our thoughts and actions with nature, cultivating virtue and inner peace. However, Stoicism does not demand a rigid, joyless existence devoid of spontaneity or emotional expression. What it does require is that our emotional responses and actions remain within the bounds of reason and do not disturb our tranquility or ethical commitments.

Let’s examine both examples you’ve provided:

1. **Cheering on a Favorite Team**: In Stoic terms, supporting a sports team can be classified as an activity related to *preferred indifferents*. This means that while it holds no intrinsic value in terms of virtue, it is permissible as long as your attachment to the outcome of the game or the fortunes of the team does not disturb your rational mind or sense of inner peace. If cheering for a team leads to excessive emotional swings—elation in victory, despair in defeat—this would be inconsistent with Stoic *ataraxia* (tranquility). 

However, if you engage in this behavior with *indifference to the outcome*—enjoying the event as a social activity or for the pleasure of the game without becoming overly attached—then it is not incompatible with Stoicism. It is the excessive emotional investment in the success or failure of the team that Stoicism cautions against, not the activity itself. 

2. **Being Childish with a Partner**: Playful, affectionate behavior with a partner is not antithetical to Stoicism, as long as it remains grounded in mutual respect and does not disrupt your pursuit of virtue. Stoics did not advocate for emotional austerity to the point of becoming emotionally cold or distant. In fact, Seneca, in his *Letters*, acknowledges the importance of friendships and relationships in life, as long as they do not become sources of irrational attachment or cause disturbance to one’s inner state.

Childlike playfulness, in moderation, can foster warmth and connection in a relationship, contributing to a healthy and balanced life. Stoicism permits enjoyment and even encourages fostering positive, supportive relationships, as long as they do not lead to dependency or emotional excess. As long as this behavior doesn’t cause you to deviate from virtue—temperance, wisdom, or justice—such moments can enrich life without compromising Stoic ideals.

In essence, Stoicism does not call for the eradication of all emotions or behaviors that might appear irrational at first glance. Instead, it advocates for balance and temperance. You may cheer for your team or playfully engage with your partner, but only insofar as these actions remain harmonious with your reasoned pursuit of a virtuous life. If these behaviors become sources of irrational passion, excessive attachment, or hinder your cultivation of virtue, then Stoicism would advise reevaluating them. However, when engaged in consciously, without excessive emotional investment, they can be integrated into a Stoic life.
