# Directive of 2025-03-29

## 🌅 1. Pre-Execution (Morning Planning)

### Today's Intent

<!-- What broader chief aim do you want to focus on today? -->
- [ ] Be productive

### 🎯 Three Core Objectives

<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- [ ] Work down tasks in Apple Reminders scheduled for today
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- [ ] Have eupator.de up and running
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
- [ ] Complete the Learn HTML & Learn CSS courses on Codecademy

### 🛠️ Process Intentions

<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1: Start with executing today's tasks
- Task 2: Do this after finishing the coding courses. Use the Sassify Astro template, focus on setting the website up bare bones. In such a way, that it can be published on the internet
- Task 3: Focus on making real progress in my understanding of programming, breeze through the lessons, making real progress, and write down what I've learned in Obsidian

### ⚠️ Efficiency Killers to Mitigate

<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->
- Tiredness
- Little focus
- Little commitment

## ⚡ 2. Execution (Live Adjustments Throughout the Day)

### 📌 Bottleneck Log

<!-- What slowed execution today? E.g., distractions, over-perfection, slow decision-making, unexpected blockers. -->
-

### 🔄 Real-Time Course Corrections

<!-- What tweaks were made mid-day to maintain efficiency? Only note direct changes to process. -->
-

---

## 🌙 3. Post-Execution Review (End of Day Process Optimization)

### 📉 Deviation Analysis

<!-- Did execution match expectation? If not, what caused deviation? -->
- ✅ Task 1:
- ✅ Task 2:  
- ✅ Task 3:  

### 🔍 Optimization Opportunities

<!-- What execution inefficiency should be addressed tomorrow? Focus on a single high-leverage improvement. -->
-

### 🧪 Micro-Iteration Commitment (Tomorrow’s Process Experiment)

<!-- What **one small tweak** will be tested tomorrow to refine execution? Keep it experimental and specific. -->
