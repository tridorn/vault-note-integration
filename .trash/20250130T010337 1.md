# Effective Note-Taking (Input → Process → Output)

### 1. Preparation

* **Set Goals**: Define what you want to extract (insights, applications, connections).
* **Structure Notes**: Pre-establish sections (Key Concepts, Questions, Reflections, Applications).

### 2. Active Engagement

* **Summarize in Own Words**: Capture meaning, not verbatim text.
* **Tag Unclear Points**: Use `?` or `#to_explore` to avoid losing flow.
* **Ask Critical Questions**: “Why is this important? How to apply? What are limitations?”
* **Capture Reactions**: Immediate thoughts serve as seeds for analysis.

### 3. Post-Processing

* **Review and Organize**: Group and highlight essentials.
* **Fill Gaps**: Revisit unclear points or research further.
* **Synthesize**: Reduce to concise summaries (Feynman-style).
* **Link Notes**: Connect to related topics for broader context.
* **Apply**: Translate concepts into concrete steps or frameworks.

## Context-Specific Adaptation

**Books**

* Summarize chapters, add reactions and questions.
* Afterward, synthesize into a few core sentences, with critical reflections.

**Lectures**

* Capture key insights and your own interpretations, not a transcript.
* Afterward, cluster notes under themes, synthesize, research gaps.

**Podcasts / Conversations**

* Note big ideas quickly.
* Afterward, consolidate using Input → Process → Output, link and apply.

## Example Condensed Outputs

* **Leadership**: Model expected behavior. Question balance with delegation (#to\_explore).
* **Decision-Making**: Use values as frameworks to reduce bias. Apply in AMU strategy session.
* **Deep Work (Cal Newport)**: Value in focus. Contrast with multitasking. Apply 2-hour morning deep work block.
* **Behavioral Economics**: Biases drive decisions. Integrate bias-recognition in training.
* **Naval Ravikant (Leverage)**: Leverage scales beyond time-based work. Explore automation in AMU reporting.

## Tools in Obsidian

* **Templater**: Automate note structures.
* **Backlinks / Graph View**: Connect new and old insights.
* **Spaced Repetition**: Revisit key ideas for recall and retention.
