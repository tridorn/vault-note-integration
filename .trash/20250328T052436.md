# Directive of 2025-03-28

## 🌅 1. Pre-Execution (Morning Planning)

### Today's Mission

<!-- What broader chief aim do you want to accomplish today? -->
- [ ] Stimulate mind through constant engagement

### 🎯 Three Core Objectives

<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- [ ] Work down scheduled tasks in Reminders
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- [ ] Have benjendyk.com operational
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
- [ ] Do other responsibilities in marches

### 🛠️ Process Intentions

<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1: As the tasks are mostly minor things, I can just work them down as fast as possible
- Task 2: Reserve the morning timeslot and focus on having a deployed website, not learning
- Task 3: Strictly adhere to planned times

### ⚠️ Efficiency Killers to Mitigate

<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->
- Sleepiness
- Distraction by minor work
- Getting bogged down

## ⚡ 2. Execution (Live Adjustments Throughout the Day)

### 📌 Bottleneck Log

<!-- What slowed execution today? E.g., distractions, over-perfection, slow decision-making, unexpected blockers. -->
- dPFK

### 🔄 Real-Time Course Corrections

<!-- What tweaks were made mid-day to maintain efficiency? Only note direct changes to process. -->

## 🌙 3. Post-Execution Review (End of Day Process Optimization)

### 📉 Deviation Analysis

<!-- Did execution match expectation? If not, what caused deviation? -->
- ✅ Task 1: I managed to resolve most of the scheduled tasks
- ✅ Task 2: My little knowledge of web programming lead to significant delays in getting the website up and running
- ✅ Task 3: I mostly focused on getting benjendyk.com operational and neglected some other (notably day trading) responsibilities because of that

### 🔍 Optimization Opportunities

<!-- What execution inefficiency should be addressed tomorrow? Focus on a single high-leverage improvement. -->
- Not doing half-hour timeframe reviews

### 🧪 Micro-Iteration Commitment (Tomorrow’s Process Experiment)

<!-- What **one small tweak** will be tested tomorrow to refine execution? Keep it experimental and specific. -->
- Go to Uni
