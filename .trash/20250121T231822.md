Your request might be rephrased more effectively as follows: "Could you suggest a logically structured folder hierarchy tailored for the finite drafting phase of my company setup? The structure should focus on providing a clear and holistic overview of the boot-up process."

### **Additional Recommendations**

1. **Dashboards and Index Notes**: Create a master dashboard in the root folder (`00_Index`) that links to key notes across subfolders.
2. **Versioning**: If revisions are frequent, maintain a `Version_History` note in each folder for tracking changes.
3. **Linkages**: Use Obsidian's linking feature to connect related notes across different folders for cross-referencing.
4. **Templates**: Include a `Templates` folder in the root directory for reusable note formats (e.g., meeting notes, task trackers).

This structure ensures that each aspect of the boot-up phase is addressed systematically while keeping the process modular and adaptable. Would you like guidance on setting up templates or linking for this structure?
