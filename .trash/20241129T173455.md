## Summary

Conceptualisation can be seen as the core step of the synthesising phase. It entails the application of the Input -> Process -> Output (IPO) scheme, and describes a note-engagement strategy that follows a predefined scheme guiding the user.

1. **Input:** Summarises the core of the concept (called Summary)
2. **Process:** For deeper engagement, own thoughts, reflections, any kind of personal touch to the concept (called Analysis)
3. **Output:** To make the concept actionable and provide guidelines or use cases for real-world value (called application)
