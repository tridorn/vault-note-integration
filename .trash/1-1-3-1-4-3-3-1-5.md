# 1-1-3-1-4-3-3-1-5

We visited Pisa and Livorno today. I have to keep this entry short as I am sitting here at 22:08 and am quite tired. I restarted the effort to implement TPS and activated the half an hourly alarms. Tomorrow should also be the first day with intensified focus on reaching the habit goals. I won't talk too much about today as nothing too exciting really happened. A rather unsuccessful and uneventful day. Having this written down I will now prepare for bed.
