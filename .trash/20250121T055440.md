## Overview

One of my first tries of creating a business, I was thinking about this all the way back in Munich already. Didn't really take any action on it, despite accumulating ChatGPT texts.

Through PR25083 archived, as this project as a standalone doesn't provide much value in the comprehensive approach to business that I intend to follow.
