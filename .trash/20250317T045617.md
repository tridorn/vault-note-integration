# Directive of 2025-03-17

## 🌅 1. Pre-Execution (Morning Planning)

### 🎯 Three Core Objectives

<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- [ ] Wrap up manual tasks (return packages, new shower head)
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- [ ] Create Uni curriculum
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
- [ ] Lay groundwork for structured day (constitution, routines for various times of the day, scope up daily responsibilities)

### 🛠️ Process Intentions

<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1: Early in the morning
- Task 2: Do as soon as possible, don't postpone
- Task 3: Do while at Uni

### ⚠️ Efficiency Killers to Mitigate

<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->
- Oversleeping through middle of the day
- Procrastination and mental aversion
- Not being productive on tasks specifically linked to work in Obsidian

## ⚡ 2. Execution (Live Adjustments Throughout the Day)

### 📌 Bottleneck Log

<!-- What slowed execution today? E.g., distractions, over-perfection, slow decision-making, unexpected blockers. -->
-

### 🔄 Real-Time Course Corrections

<!-- What tweaks were made mid-day to maintain efficiency? Only note direct changes to process. -->
-

---

## 🌙 3. Post-Execution Review (End of Day Process Optimization)

### 📉 Deviation Analysis

<!-- Did execution match expectation? If not, what caused deviation? -->
- ✅ Task 1: I didn't do any work on the task
- ✅ Task 2: Same as above
- ✅ Task 3: Same as above

### 🔍 Optimization Opportunities

<!-- What execution inefficiency should be addressed tomorrow? Focus on a single high-leverage improvement. -->
- Stop oversleeping

### 🧪 Micro-Iteration Commitment (Tomorrow’s Process Experiment)

<!-- What **one small tweak** will be tested tomorrow to refine execution? Keep it experimental and specific. -->
- Shorten morning nap to the regular 20 minutes.
