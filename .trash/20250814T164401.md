# Cross-medium Note System

## Premise

Not aesthetic notes, but an evidence-to-synthesis pipeline. Analogue capture improves focus and comprehension; digital structuring ensures permanence, searchability, and reuse. Enforce separation of capture, processing, distillation, synthesis, with minimal friction.

## Layers

**1. Capture (Analogue-first)**

* Purpose: Bind attention, stimulate cognition.
* Methods: Marginalia, index cards, post-its, wallboards.
* Rules: One idea per card; always include source anchor (page/timestamp); avoid full summaries—focus on triggers.

**2. Processing (Transitional)**

* Purpose: Transfer fragments to digital without loss.
* Method: End of session/daily transcription to markdown scratchpad.
* Rules: Intake logs immutable; tag with metadata (#book/TheMomTest #chapter/3).

**3. Distillation (Digital-first)**

* Purpose: Extract operational essence.
* Method: Create one Concept Note per idea/framework. Rewrite in own words, attach examples, link wiki-style (\[\[Lean\_Canvas]]).
* Add Action Hooks for application.

**4. Synthesis (Output-focused)**

* Purpose: Turn knowledge into frameworks, checklists, rules.
* Method: Weekly review distilled notes, create 1–2 synthesis notes in /frameworks, attach validation plan.

## File + Tag Structure

```
/library
   /books/[BookTitle]
       raw.md
       concepts/*.md
   /frameworks/*.md
   /logs/reading_log_2025.md
```

Tags: #book #article #podcast; #product #sales #ux; #raw #distilled #tested.

## Medium Adaptations

* Analogue: index cards atomic, color-coded by domain; wallboards for visual framework mapping.
* Digital: markdown permanence + backlinks.
* Hybrid: photograph wallboards, attach to concept notes.

## Routines

* Daily: analogue → digital.
* Weekly: distil raw → concept notes, review backlog.
* Monthly: prune/merge, update tags.
* Kill rule: discard #raw older than 30 days.
