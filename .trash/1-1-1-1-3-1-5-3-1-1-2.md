## Introduction

*Write a brief introduction to your day. This can include your intentions, a summary of what you aim to achieve, or any notable events or tasks planned for the day.*

This is the first time, the first day I use this template and any kind of medium for my day. My aim is to get an initial feel and start a streak, trying my best but also doing only the minimum to not overstrain myself.

I aim to finally resolve some of my future problems by trying to enter the study place raffle which I avoided for so long and get into a flow again after I slacked off again the last few days.
