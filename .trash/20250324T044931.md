# PR25083 Rebooting of Business Efforts

---

## Overview

I have made a variety of (practically only theoretical) trys of starting business ventures. The accumulated material has grown over time, with no successes or even practical applications to show for. With this project I aim to go through the existing approaches, catalogue them, and cut unnecessary clutter.
Another chief aim despite trying to reuse components however, is to be able to start with a clean slate, agile and fast.
