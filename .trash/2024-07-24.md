## Introduction

*Write a brief introduction to your day. This can include your intentions, a summary of what you aim to achieve, or any notable events or tasks planned for the day.*

This day marks the first time (since the last time) that I am going to employ this day time frame document. Way easier faster in setup than I thought it would be. The real work is the review at the end of the day it seems like.

The major area of attention is to make progress, slow and granular, but progress, on the LMS. I plan on completing 5 domains, everything contained within will just be bare-bones, yet I have to start somewhere. Enduring attention and progress beats periodic rodeos.

## Overview of Half-Hour Timeframes

*Summarize your activities within each session of the day. Group your half-hour timeframes under these sessions to provide a condensed view of your day.*

### Night Rest (22:30-03:00)

Started sleeping at about 23:00 and slightly overslept until 04:00.

### Early-Morning Work (03:00-07:00)

Didn't do anything particularly productive, read some Konosuba LN, however, also, didn't fall asleep again.

### Morning Rest (07:00-09:00)

Didn't do nap 1, and instead of doing UBW I created a new training plan in hopes of reigniting my sports pursuits.

### Morning Work (09:00-13:00)

Don't really remember what I did. Worked on LMS and once again proceeded with a fundamental reshape of how its structured after a personal crisis.

Only very briefly touched on the business session by introducing a new business book (Business: The ultimate Resource).

### Noon Rest (13:00-14:00)

Ate rice. Didn't do nap 2.

### Afternoon Work (14:00-18:00)

Did the finance session, I primarily need time in front of charts (my second day here) and a better understanding for how I should set up.

### Evening Rest (18:00-18:30)

Did LBW from 18:00 to 19:00, one of a recent streak, today however I managed to go again for the full hour.

### Evening Work (18:30-22:30)

From 19:00 to 20:00 ate DÃ¶ner, read some more Konosuba. Then, until 21:00 I did my evening routine

## Conclusion

I am happy with how this day turned out. I didn't make significant progress on the primary objectives but I feel that I am going somewhere (with the most recent reshape of LMS) and that might allow me to finally pick up the speed in that regard.  
Besides that, the other thing I feel positive about is how I followed the structure that I defined, the daily scheduling, and that from morning until evening
