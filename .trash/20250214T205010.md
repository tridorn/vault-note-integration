# Reincarnation of Augustus

20:50

I have decided to "act as the reincarnation" of Augustus. In other words, let Aion impersonate Augustus.

I have previously seen that acting as a past figure, trying to act, think, be like him, is a powerful instrument in character change. Not acting like a self defined persona, trying to impersonate a nebulous picture of someone undefined, using a tangible and real person (well documented at that), allows the impersonation attempt to feel more powerful.
