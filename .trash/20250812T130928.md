A minimal, composable foundation: nine primitives, no overlap, each answering a distinct question.

   Keys: summary, canonical\_content\_ref

4. **Connect** – How does it relate (graph/structure)?
   Keys: parents, children, related, tags

5. **Track (State)** – Where is it in its lifecycle, who is responsible?
   Keys: stage, status, owner, due

6. **Prove (Provenance)** – Where from, who touched it?
   Keys: sources, author, created, modified

7. **Govern (Policy)** – Rules and constraints for handling.
   Keys: sensitivity, license, sharing\_scope, retention

8. **Observe (Signals)** – Indicators of utility or activity.
   Keys: last\_opened, open\_count, quality\_score

9. **Act (Operations)** – What actions or automations apply.
