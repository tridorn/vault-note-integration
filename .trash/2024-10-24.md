## Summary

Today started great with me keeping the outlined sleeping schedule. I did a fast morning routine but slumped in entertainment afterwards. Didn't achieve too much of notice afterwards, even tho I applied the timeframe system consistently.  
Did a short nap 1 and went to train afterward at 07:30 which is an immense success as I neither overslept and was able to train in the morning which has proven one of the hardest things for me to do.  
In the early morning I had the immense desire to play Crusader Kings 3, probably as a coping mechanism for not attending university. I drove to Rewe, bought Energy drinks while downloading multiple games, however felt too sleepy and slept from about 11:30 to about 15:30.  
From there onwards I played the games until about 23:00.
