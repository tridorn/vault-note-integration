We once again went to Florence today. Way less movement dispersed through the city and more concentrated exploration around the Duomo di Firenze. We arrived in the city via Tram, took some pictures of the front of the cathedral and went up the bell tower. We relaxed with a beer after and then visited the museum of duomo. Now that I think about it I question where exactly the time went to. After the museum visit at around 19:00 we ate dinner and arrived home at about 21:00.
It is currently 21:53 and as I am quite out of energy I will leave todays note once again at that, a general description of what happend
