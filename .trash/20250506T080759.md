---

## Pre-Execution

### Intention
<!-- What broader chief aim do you want to focus on today? -->
- Make tangible progress in LEADBeyond project 

### Objectives
<!-- Most critical task 1 – outcome-driven, not just an activity. -->
- Create competitor table
<!-- Most critical task 2 – make it concrete and measurable. -->
- Create v2 of all one-pagers
<!-- Most critical task 3 – must fit within the day’s execution capacity. -->
-  Create data fields for all 5 core markets

### Process
<!-- How will this be executed most efficiently? E.g., deep work session, batching tasks, specific tool usage. -->
- Task 1: Start with this, use clean slate ChatGPT conversation and iterate on initial output manually
- Task 2: Ask ChatGPT for tasks/sources and manually collect information and sources
- Task 3: Gather data fields and start collecting or approximating the points

### Friction Mitigation
<!-- What are the biggest risks to focus/execution today? E.g., distractions, decision fatigue, overplanning. -->
- Unproductiveness/Use half-hour timeframes religiously
- Stress/Remove from outcome, focus on effort

## Execution

### Frictions
<!-- What slowed execution today? E.g., distractions, over-perfection, slow decision-making, unexpected blockers. -->
- 

### Adjustments

## Post-Execution

### Objectives Deviation
<!-- Did execution match expectation? If not, what caused deviation? -->
- [ ] Task 1:
- [ ] Task 2:  
- [ ] Task 3:  

### Optimisation
<!-- What execution inefficiency should be addressed tomorrow? Focus on a single high-leverage improvement. -->
- 

### Process Experiment
<!-- What **one small tweak** will be tested tomorrow to refine execution? Keep it experimental and specific. -->
