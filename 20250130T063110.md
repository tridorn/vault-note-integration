You‚Äôre absolutely correct‚Äî**primary contexts** like `Focus` and `Quick Wins` define the overarching action type or mental mode, while **secondary contexts**, such as specific locations or tools required, add additional filters to narrow down tasks. Integrating these two types of contexts ensures tasks are actionable in the most relevant scenarios. Here‚Äôs how they work together and how to apply them effectively:

---

### **Understanding Primary vs. Secondary Contexts**

#### **Primary Contexts**

- Represent the **core nature of the task**:
  - **Examples**: `Focus`, `Quick Wins`, `Collaborate`, `Admin`, `Growth`.
- Used as **broad categories** to filter tasks based on mental effort, time requirements, or collaboration.

#### **Secondary Contexts**

- Add **specific, situational constraints** to tasks:
  - **Examples**:
	 - **Location-Based**: `@Office`, `@Home`, `@Errands`.
	 - **Tool-Based**: `@Computer`, `@Phone`, `@Internet`.
	 - **Energy-Based**: `@LowEnergy`, `@HighEnergy`.
- Provide **nuanced filters** to determine where or how a task can be done.

---

### **Integrating Primary and Secondary Contexts**

#### **1. Assign Both Contexts to Tasks**

When capturing a task, assign:
- A **primary context** based on the type of task (e.g., `Focus` for deep work or `Quick Wins` for short tasks).
- A **secondary context** for any situational requirement (e.g., `@Office`, `@Internet`).

#### **2. Combine in Smart Lists**

Smart lists can integrate **primary and secondary contexts** to create actionable views. For example:
- **Example 1**: `üß† Focus + @Office`
  - **Criteria**:
	 - List = Focus
	 - Tag = @Office
  - **Purpose**: Displays focused work that requires being in the office.
- **Example 2**: `‚ö° Quick Wins + @Errands`
  - **Criteria**:
	 - List = Quick Wins
	 - Tag = @Errands
  - **Purpose**: Highlights short tasks that can be done while running errands.

#### **3. Use Secondary Contexts Dynamically**

Secondary contexts help **adapt your workflow**:
- When in a specific location (e.g., office or home), filter tasks using secondary contexts.
- When your energy level or available tools change, switch to lists that align with those factors.

### **How To Use and Apply Primary + Secondary Contexts**

#### **1. During Task Capture**

Assign both a **primary context** and a **secondary context**:
- **Primary Context**: Defines the mental effort or type of task.
- **Secondary Context**: Captures any specific requirements, such as location, tools, or energy.

#### **2. During Daily Use**

Use smart lists combining primary and secondary contexts to adapt to real-time circumstances:
- **Example Workflow**:
  - **Morning (Focused Work)**:
	 - Use `üß† Focus + @Office` to work on deep tasks while in the office.
  - **Midday (Errands)**:
	 - Switch to `‚ö° Quick Wins + @Errands` while running errands.
  - **Evening (Energy-Saving)**:
	 - Use `‚ö° Quick Wins + @LowEnergy` for easy wins when energy is low.

#### **3. During Reviews**

In your weekly review:
- Adjust primary contexts based on task type or goal alignment.
- Ensure secondary contexts like location or tools are accurate and actionable.

### **Recommended Smart List Examples for Primary + Secondary Contexts**

#### **1. Location-Specific Tasks**

- **@Office**:
  - `üß† Focus + @Office`: Deep work tasks requiring office resources.
  - `üìã Admin + @Office`: Routine admin tasks to complete in the office.
- **@Home**:
  - `üöÄ Growth + @Home`: Learning or self-improvement tasks at home.
  - `‚ö° Quick Wins + @Home`: Short tasks manageable in a home setting.
- **@Errands**:
  - `‚ö° Quick Wins + @Errands`: Quick tasks to complete while out and about.

#### **2. Tool-Specific Tasks**

- **@Computer**:
  - `üß† Focus + @Computer`: Focused work requiring a computer.
  - `üìã Admin + @Computer`: Admin tasks to do while at your desk.
- **@Phone**:
  - `‚ö° Quick Wins + @Phone`: Short calls or texts you can do on your phone.
  - `ü§ù Collaborate + @Phone`: Calls or meetings requiring collaboration.
- **@Internet**:
  - `üöÄ Growth + @Internet`: Online learning or research tasks.

#### **3. Energy-Specific Tasks**

- **@LowEnergy**:
  - `‚ö° Quick Wins + @LowEnergy`: Easy tasks for when your energy is low.
  - `üìã Admin + @LowEnergy`: Routine tasks that don‚Äôt require much mental effort.
- **@HighEnergy**:
  - `üß† Focus + @HighEnergy`: Deep work for peak productivity periods.
  - `ü§ù Collaborate + @HighEnergy`: High-stakes meetings or brainstorming sessions.

### **Practical Examples of Combining Contexts**

#### **Scenario 1: Working in the Office**

1. Open `üß† Focus + @Office` to tackle deep work that requires office tools/resources.
2. Switch to `üìã Admin + @Office` for routine office admin tasks.

#### **Scenario 2: Running Errands**

1. Use `‚ö° Quick Wins + @Errands` to complete quick tasks like picking up supplies or dropping off packages.

#### **Scenario 3: Low Energy at Home**

1. Open `‚ö° Quick Wins + @LowEnergy` to knock out simple tasks while winding down.
2. Use `üìã Admin + @LowEnergy` to process low-effort admin work.

### **Benefits Of Using Primary + Secondary Contexts**

1. **Granular Actionability**:
	- Combines the big picture (primary context) with situational constraints (secondary context).
	- Allows you to adapt your workflow to your current circumstances.

2. **Flexible Discovery**:
	- Helps you quickly find tasks that fit your energy level, location, or available tools.
	- Reduces wasted time deciding "what can I do now?"

3. **Enhanced Productivity**:
	- Ensures you‚Äôre always working on tasks that match your current environment or resources.
	- Encourages better task sequencing based on what‚Äôs feasible.

This system makes task discovery dynamic and adaptable, ensuring you‚Äôre always working on the **right task at the right time in the right place**. Let me know if you‚Äôd like help setting up specific smart lists in Apple Reminders!
