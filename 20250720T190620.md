Below is a **practical framework for structuring the _body_ of your notes**--the parts that live _below_ the YAML.  
Think of it as a set of _atomic templates_ you can mix-and-match; each follows the same predictable anatomy so you can read, link, and update them at speed.

* * *

## 1 Universal Anatomy (works for every note)
    
    
    # Title%20mirrors%20YAML
    
    > [!abstract] **TL;DR**  
    > One-sentence takeaway or purpose of this note.
    
    ## 1 Context   *(Why does this exist?)*  
    Short paragraph that explains the trigger, question, or goal.
    
    ## 2 Content   *(The meat)*  
    Write freely here--use headings, lists, tables, images, code.
    
    ## 3 Actions / Next Steps   *(If any)*  
    - [ ] Task 1, linked to project  
    - [ ] Task 2
    
    ## 4 Links   *(Connections)*  
    - **Backlinks:** auto-generated by Obsidian  
    - **Explicit links:**  
      - Broader → [[20240405121530]]  
      - Related → [[20240614144702]]
    
    ## 5 References   *(Sources & evidence)*  
    - Newport 2016 -- *Deep Work*  
    - DOI: 10.1145/1234567

**Why this works**

| Section | Reason | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `H1` | Guarantees title ↔ YAML sync. | 
| `abstract` callout | Instant preview in hover & graph. | 
| Numeric headings | Make every note skimmable, script-friendly. | 
| Actions | Keeps work discoverable via Dataview. | 
| Explicit Links | Complements Breadcrumbs `link:` block. | 
| References | Enables cite-by-search & future export. | 
| Changelog | Human eye on top of Git history; delete if noisy. |

    ## 2 Immediate Tag
    `#capture`

    - Project → [[P2025-003-Deep_Work]]

## 3 Progressive Updating Rules

1. **Capture → Triage**

    - Convert Capture stub to full template only _after_ triage decides its fate.

2. **Draft → Final**

    - While in `50_Build/`, keep only sections **Context** & **Content**.

    - Add `abstract`, `References`, `Links` once moving to `60_Ship/`.

3. **Promote to Library**

    - Trim narrative fluff; keep _Essence_, _Key Points_, _Examples_.
* * *

## 4 Linking & Block-Refs

| Technique | When | 
| ---- | ----  |
| `[[uid]]` | Stable identity links (works after title changes). | 
| `[[uid#^blockID]]` | Quote precise evidence; use Obsidian block IDs (`⌘+⌥+L`). | 
| Embeds `![[uid]]` | Show canonical diagrams or key tables without duplication. | 

* * *

## 5 Markdown Style Conventions

| Pattern | Usage | 
| ---- | ----  |
| ✅ Emoji prefixes | Quick visual scanning (`🗂`, `✦`, `📅`). | 
| Callouts (`> [!note]`) | Highlight tips, warnings, quotes. | 
| Code fences | Use language hints (````python`). | 
| Tables | For specs, metrics, milestone matrices. | 
| Footnotes | Rare; prefer inline `[link]^1` for brevity. | 

* * *

## 6 Automatable Hooks

1. **On Save (Git/Obsidian hook)**

    - Update `updated` & `rev` in YAML.

    - If word count changed, update `desc.words`.

2. **On Folder Move**

    - Inject or update section stubs (e.g., `Abstract`, `Sources`).

    - Insert "Definition of Done" checklist when entering `50_Build/`.

3. **Nightly Script**

    - Rebuild `keywords_auto`.

    - Validate every note in `80_Library/` has _Essence_ section.
* * *

### TL;DR

_Every note_ starts with the **Universal Anatomy**.  
You then layer on specialized sections **only when the note's purpose warrants it**:

| Stage | Key Extra Section | 
| ---- | ----  |
| Capture | _(none)_ | 
| Plan | Objectives / Milestones | 
| Build | Working log, checklist | 
| Ship | References & Links | 
| Reflect | Metrics, gratitude | 
| Library | Essence, Key Points, Examples | 

By keeping both **metadata (YAML)** and **content skeletons** predictable, your vault stays machine-readable _and_ human-pleasant--no matter how large it grows.
