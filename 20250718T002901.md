Below is the **final, lifecycle-driven vault scaffold**--now restored to eight active stages by re-introducing an "ideas maturing" phase named **`03_Nurture/`**.  
Each folder's title is a verb that answers the question _"What is happening to the note right now?"_; every folder has one--and only one--job.

## Top-level flow

| # | Folder | One-sentence purpose | 
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| `00_System/` | House templates, snippets, media, logs--never content. |  | 
| `01_Capture/` | _I just grabbed it._ Raw, unprocessed inflow. |  | 
| `02_Triage/` | _I'm deciding what it is._ Two-minute clarification & routing. |  | 
| `03_Nurture/` | _I'm letting it ripen._ Not actionable yet, but worth revisiting. |  | 
| `04_Plan/` | _I've committed to act._ Scoped projects, tasks, schedules. |  | 
| `05_Work/` | _I'm actively shaping it._ Drafting, research, prototyping. |  | 
| `06_Deliver/` | _It's done and shipped._ Final artifacts handed off or published. |  | 
| `07_Learn/` | _I'm extracting insight._ Journals, retros, lessons learned. |  | 
| `08_Library/` | _It's evergreen knowledge._ Concepts, methods, reusable resources. |  | 
| `98_Archive/` | _Cold storage._ Anything obsolete or finished > 1 year. |  |

## Why each folder is distinct

- **`01_Capture/` vs. `02_Triage/`** -- Raw vs. clarified; nothing stays in Capture past the daily sweep.
- **`03_Nurture/`** -- Holds only _uncommitted_ possibilities; once scheduled it _must_ leave.
- **`04_Plan/` vs. `05_Work/`** -- Planning contains scope & next actions; Work contains evolving drafts and research.
- **`06_Deliver/` vs. `08_Library/`** -- Deliver is the _final artifact_ of a project; Library is the _timeless knowledge_ distilled from many projects.
- **`07_Learn/`** -- Personal sense-making that may or may not promote ideas into Library.
- **`98_Archive/`** -- Anything whose active lifecycle ended long ago; keeps the working set uncluttered.

### How to use it tomorrow morning

1. **Capture quickly** -- dump everything into `01_Capture/`.

2. **Triage daily** -- move items to `02_Triage/` and route: do, delegate, defer, nurture, or delete.

3. **Review `03_Nurture/` weekly** -- promote ripe ideas to `04_Plan/`.

4. **Quarterly pruning** -- archive stale projects and empty sub-folders.

With this structure you always know _where_ a note is in its life and _why_ it belongs there--clear-cut, rational, elegant.
