"In general, when consuming information—whether from a book, lecture, or otherwise—I seek to shift my focus away from the medium itself, emphasizing solely my own understanding of the subject. How should I approach this?"

The challenge here is transitioning from passive reception to active cognition. The medium, while initially necessary, becomes superfluous once its core message is internalized. To achieve this, you should reframe your interaction with the content, transforming it into a personal cognitive process.

1. **Socratic Engagement**: Instead of simply absorbing, engage the material with continuous questioning. After each major idea, ask yourself: "Why is this important? What are the underlying assumptions? How does this fit into my current knowledge?" This leads you to distill the material in your own terms.

2. **Feynman Technique**: Force yourself to explain the topic as if you were teaching it to someone else, preferably in the simplest terms possible. This method reveals gaps in your understanding and demands that you reconstruct the knowledge in a way that is genuinely yours.

3. **Mind Mapping**: Move away from linear note-taking and instead, create mind maps that visually organize the relationships between concepts. The act of placing ideas spatially on a page helps in internalizing and synthesizing the material rather than passively recording it.

4. **Active Recall and Application**: Regularly test yourself on the concepts without referring to the source. Apply the principles or ideas in hypothetical scenarios or real-life situations. The goal is to develop an intuitive, rather than rote, grasp of the material.

5. **Deconstruct the Medium**: Strip down the information to its essence. Abstract away the details of how the information is presented (e.g., the writing style, the author's bias) and focus on what is universally true or applicable.

This methodology, when consistently applied, shifts the locus of learning from the external medium to the internal mechanics of your thought process, allowing you to "own" the knowledge rather than merely borrow it.
