*Correction → A more precise formulation of your request:*  
> “Please provide a radically clear and logically pristine delineation of the three-part personnel framework—**Vertical Ranks (authority/responsibility), Horizontal Paths (career specialisation), and Assignments (temporary positional deployments)**—such that every person simultaneously occupies exactly **one Vertical Rank**, exactly **one Horizontal Path**, and optionally has **one temporary Assignment**. Eliminate overlaps, clarify boundaries, and extend the system as needed (e.g., below the ‘probe officer’ level), to create a meritocratic and rigorously logical structure.”

---

## **I / Fundamental Logic of the Framework**

In this clarified ACM staffing architecture, **every single individual simultaneously occupies three distinct and orthogonal domains**:

- **VERTICAL RANK (authority)** → a single, explicit hierarchical level defining their scope of responsibility.
- **HORIZONTAL PATH (expertise)** → a single, persistent career-track defining their core skill identity.
- **ASSIGNMENT (temporary role)** → at most one clearly scoped temporary positional deployment at a time.

These domains remain strictly non-overlapping; each defines a clearly distinct dimension:

```
        Vertical Rank (authority & responsibility)
                     │
Horizontal Path (skills & identity) ─── Individual ─── Assignment (temporary deployment)
```

---

## **II / Radical Clarity: VERTICAL RANKS**

Vertical Rank is the unambiguous **chain of command**, defining authority, accountability, and strategic responsibility. All personnel are assigned exactly **one** vertical rank at any given moment.

| Rank Level | Rank Name             | Scope of Authority                          | Promotion Gate                       |
|------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **V-0**    | *Candidate*           | Individual contribution only; no command    | Probation (6-month review)           |
| **V-1**    | *Probationary Officer (Probe Officer)* | Leads one AMU at a time (rotational)  | Successfully leads ≥2 missions       |
| **V-2**    | *Field Officer (LFO)* | Aligns multiple AMUs; pilots new processes  | Board of Officers & mission KPIs     |
| **V-3**    | *Senior Officer*      | Commands Task Force; budgetary accountability | Successful Task Force outcomes     |
| **V-4**    | *Staff Officer*       | Leads AGS Cell; strategic & doctrinal authority | Doctrine contribution (AAR publication)|
| **V-5**    | *Senior Staff Officer*| AGS Chief; cross-domain responsibility      | Board of Officers (multi-domain leadership)|
| **V-6**    | *Council Officer*     | Leadership Council member; org-wide oversight| Extraordinary LC endorsement         |

**Clarification**:  
- Each rank is explicitly hierarchical, one clearly above the other.  
- Promotion is strictly meritocratic: "up-or-out" applies from V-2 upward.

## **III / Radical Clarity: HORIZONTAL PATHS**

Horizontal Paths describe the persistent core career specialisation and identity. Every person occupies exactly **one horizontal path** at all times. Vertical rank ascension within these horizontal tracks is fully permitted and encouraged:

| Path Identifier | Path Name        | Typical Skillset & Role                   | Examples of Vertical Progression     |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **H-A**         | *Command*        | Generalist leadership, AMU command, task-force management | Probe Officer → LFO → Senior Officer |
| **H-B**         | *Staff & Strategy*| Doctrine formulation, planning, AGS cells| Analyst → Staff Officer → Chief of AGS|
| **H-C**         | *Innovation & Ventures*| Venture origination, experimentation, market testing | Innovator → Venture Lead → Innovation Officer|
| **H-D**         | *Specialist*     | Domain mastery (engineering, design, finance, legal, etc.) | Junior Specialist → Lead Specialist → Domain Chief |
| **H-E**         | *Operations & Support*| OCD backbone (HR, Finance, IT, Admin)| Coordinator → Manager → Head of OCD |

**Clarification**:  
- Each individual explicitly chooses or is assigned exactly one horizontal path.
- Horizontal mobility (switching paths) is possible but subject to rigorous assessment and typically infrequent.
- Horizontal paths remain stable over long-term careers, providing persistent professional identity.

---

## **IV / Radical Clarity: TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENTS**

Assignments are temporary positional deployments—clearly bounded, explicitly scoped, and always transient. At most **one** assignment per individual at any given moment.

| Assignment Class | Purpose & Description                               | Duration            | Example Roles                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **A-1: Embedded Contributor** | Temporary contributor filling AMU capability gaps | ≤1 mission cycle    | Freelancer, Gig-Worker               |
| **A-2: Advisor** | Non-executive external/internal expert; advisory only (no command authority) | Episodic            | Fractional CFO, External Advisor     |
| **A-3: Liaison** | Cross-node coordination; dual-reporting for info alignment | Mission-based       | Partner Integration Liaison          |
| **A-4: Secretariat** | Administrative or executive assistant role, no strategic authority | Ongoing / Indefinite| Executive Assistant, Chief-of-Staff  |
| **A-5: Audit & Compliance** | Independent oversight or compliance review (temporary autonomy) | Scheduled / Event-driven | Internal Auditor, Compliance Delegate|
| **A-6: Rotational Development** | Short-term developmental rotation across teams for cross-pollination | 1–3 sprints         | Junior Officer rotation through AMUs |

**Clarification**:  
- Assignments are clearly orthogonal to both vertical and horizontal domains.
- Assignments are always temporary; long-term roles must be horizontalized as "specialist" or operational paths instead.
- Individuals typically have assignments intermittently; some personnel (especially senior) may have none.

## **V / Practical Examples of Combined Positioning**

To further illustrate radical clarity, consider these examples:

| Individual | Vertical Rank | Horizontal Path | Temporary Assignment                   | Explanation                           |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Anna       | V-2 (LFO)     | H-A (Command)   | None                                   | Leads multiple AMUs, career commander |
| Ben        | V-1 (Probe Officer)| H-B (Strategy)| A-6 (Rotational Development AMU Lead)| Strategy specialist testing command skills|
| Clara      | V-3 (Senior Officer)| H-C (Innovation)| None                             | Leads innovation-focused Task Force   |
| David      | V-4 (Staff Officer)| H-B (Strategy)| A-2 (Advisor, Fractional CFO)       | AGS analyst advising AMU finances     |
| Eva        | V-0 (Candidate)| H-D (Specialist)| A-1 (Embedded Contributor, Figma design)| Junior specialist supporting AMU temporarily|
| Finn       | V-5 (Senior Staff Officer)| H-B (Strategy)| A-4 (Secretariat, Chief-of-Staff)| AGS Chief supported administratively  |

- **Clear Separation**: Vertical rank = hierarchy, horizontal path = professional expertise, assignment = temporary role.
- **No Overlaps**: Each person has exactly one position in each of the three dimensions simultaneously.

---

## **VI / Meritocracy, Promotion, and Up-or-Out Culture**

- Vertical promotions strictly gated by transparent merit criteria.
- Horizontal mobility (switching specialisation) allowed but subject to rigorous evaluation.
- Assignments periodically reviewed and terminated; cannot become de facto permanent roles.
- "Up-or-Out" after V-2: Stagnation prompts lateral move to Specialist path or managed exit.

---

## **VII / Implementation Checklist**

1. Create Notion databases clearly separate:
   - Vertical Ranks database (officer registry)
   - Horizontal Paths database (career identity)
   - Assignments database (temporary deployment tracker)
  
2. Formalize assessment boards for each vertical rank advancement.
3. Limit assignments to exactly one per person, strictly temporary.
4. Publicize clear paths for vertical progression & horizontal mobility.
5. Reinforce transparent evaluations; maintain internal publication of promotions.

## **VIII / Why this Works: Radical Clarity Ensures Excellence**

- **Logical purity**: No conceptual overlaps; easy to understand.
- **Clear accountability**: Everyone knows exactly their rank, specialisation, and assignment.
- **Meritocratic discipline**: Promotion clarity drives excellence; stagnation is avoided by defined career gates.
- **Flexible agility**: Temporary assignments allow talent to be rapidly redeployed where needed without role dilution.

This radical clarity yields a powerful, robust, scalable staffing system ideally suited to ACM—building a meritocratic “company of commanders” and genuine A-player magnet.
