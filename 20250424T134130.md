### Eupator ‚Äî Unified ACM Framework  
*Definitions, structural blue-print and officer assignment for every grouping*

| ACM-Grouping | Purpose & Typical Use-Case | Standard Size & Tenure | Officer Billet(s) | Core Artefacts | When it ‚Äúbecomes‚Äù the next tier |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Adaptive Mission Unit (AMU)** | Single, time-boxed objective (ship feature, close client deal, validate hypothesis). | 4 ‚Äì 12 members ‚Ä¢ 2‚Äì12 weeks. | **O-0** Probationer (AMU-Lead) ‚Üê accountable. <br>Optional **O-1** LFO attached (coach / unblock). | *Mission-Charter* ¬∑ Sprint Backlog ¬∑ Mission-Log ¬∑ AAR. | On completion: ‚Ä¢ disband OR ‚Ä¢ is chained with 2-4 sister-AMUs ‚Üí forms a *Mission Group*. |
| **Mission Group (MG)** | Cluster of AMUs pursuing one composite deliverable (e.g. ‚ÄúEU launch pack‚Äù: localisation, partnerships, legal). | 2 ‚Äì 6 parallel AMUs ‚Ä¢ 1‚Äì3 months. | **O-1** Field Officer = Group-Lead.<br>Can host one **O-0** per AMU. | *Group-Brief* ¬∑ Dependency Board ¬∑ KPI dashboard. | When objective spans > 1 domain *or* budget crosses Task-Force threshold (‚âà ‚Ç¨250k) ‚Üí escalate to Task Force. |
| **Task Force (TF)** | Medium-scale programme with material P&L, multi-function scope (‚ÄúDigital-Agency book of business‚Äù; ‚ÄúSeries-A fund-raise‚Äù). | 2 ‚Äì 5 Mission Groups ‚Ä¢ 3‚Äì12 months ‚Ä¢ ‚â§ ‚Ç¨2 m. | **O-2** Senior Field Officer (TF-Cdr).<br>May carry an **O-1 XO**. | *Task-Force Operating-Plan* ¬∑ Rolling Budget ¬∑ Risk Matrix ¬∑ Monthly Review. | If budget > ‚Ç¨2 m, multi-year horizon, or touches multiple venture lines ‚áí Strategic Command. |
| **Strategic Command (SC)** | End-to-end stewardship of a full **venture line** inside Eupator (e.g. *Side-Hustle Command*, *Agency Command*, *Startup Command*). Owns revenue, compliance, brand. | Several Task Forces ‚Ä¢ multi-year. | **O-3/4** Staff Officer as Chief-of-Staff.<br>**O-5** Command Officer overall lead. | *Domain P&L* ¬∑ Annual OKRs ¬∑ Portfolio Kanban ¬∑ Master Risk Register. | If spun-off ‚Üí becomes independent *Venture Spin-off* (see below). |
| **Eupator Leadership Council (LC)** | Corporate brain-trust, cross-command alignment, capital allocation, culture. | 5‚Äì7 seats. | **O-5/6** Councillors (CEO, CFO, CPO, CTO ‚Ä¶). | Vision Charter ¬∑ Strategy Map ¬∑ Capital Allocation Doc ¬∑ Compliance Ledger. | ‚Äî |

### Officer-Corps overlay (quick recall)

| Rank | Typical Node | Authority Highlights |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| **O-0 Probe Officer** | Leads an AMU. | Tactical delivery, gains command credit. |
| **O-1 Field Officer (LFO)** | Leads Mission Group; mentors AMUs. | Alignment, unblock, micro-experiments. |
| **O-2 Senior FO** | Commands Task Force. | Owns budget, staffing, outcome P&L. |
| **O-3/4 Staff Officer** | Leads AGS Cell or XO to SC. | Doctrine, scenario planning, resourcing. |
| **O-5 Command Officer** | Leads Strategic Command. | Domain strategy, venture P&L, board prep. |
| **O-6 Councillor** | Seat on LC. | Whole-of-company stewardship. |

(Officers *retain* their commission while moving between field and staff billets.)

### How ventures map to the structure

| Venture class inside Eupator | Structural home | Example flow |
|------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Side Hustle** (Notion templates) | *Mission Group* under *Side-Hustle Command*. <br>Each new product = AMU. | AMU ‚Üí AAR ‚Üí cash flows to Command P&L. |
| **Service Business / Agency** | *Task Force* under *Business Command*. <br>Each client project = AMU; departments = Mission Groups. | TF collects margin; scales by spawning more MGs. |
| **Startup (risky, scalable)** | Dedicated *Startup Task Force* inside *Startup Command* for MVP phase. <br>When metrics validate, TF graduates to its **own Strategic Command**. | Later, if external capital + separate cap-table adopted, SC is carved-out as **Spin-off company**; parent retains equity. |

**Spin-off mechanics:**  
1. LC vote ‚Üí carve-out charter.  
2. SC artifacts copied to new Notion workspace.  
3. Officer cadre seconded (O-2 TF-Cdr becomes spin-off CEO).  
4. Service-level agreement signed with Eupator OCDs.

### Archetypal AMU template (Notion fields)

| Property | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Mission ID | SH-2025-NT-Template-01 |
| Objective | ‚ÄúShip AI-Planner Notion kit‚Äù |
| Lead (O-0) | Jane Doe |
| LFO (O-1) | Lt P. Rao |
| Start / End | 3 Jun ‚Äì 24 Jun |
| Key Results | 500 sales ¬∑ > ‚Ç¨7 k revenue |
| Status | üö© Execution |
| Parent MG | ‚ÄúTemplates V4 Cluster‚Äù |

The **Mission Charter** page embeds sprint board, risk list, daily log, and ties automatically into higher dashboards.

---

### Governance cadence (rhythm)

| Node | Cadence | Key Ritual |
|------|---------|------------|
| AMU | Daily stand-up ‚Ä¢ Sprint demo weekly | Log ‚Üí LFO |
| Mission Group | Weekly sync | Dependency board |
| Task Force | Bi-weekly Ops-review | KPI deck to SC |
| Strategic Command | Monthly Business-review | P&L, risks, staffing |
| Leadership Council | Quarterly Strategic-summit | Capital & risk reset |

---

### Decision matrix (when to create which node)

| Trigger | Node to spawn |
|---------|---------------|
| One cross-functional deliverable ‚â§ 12 weeks | **AMU** |
| ‚â• 2 AMUs share objective & resource pool | **Mission Group** |
| Budget ‚â• ‚Ç¨250 k or multi-function programme | **Task Force** |
| Full venture line with own revenue model | **Strategic Command** |
| Outside investors / separate equity | **Spin-off company** |

---

### Relationship to Specialists & Innovation path  

*Specialists* remain deep craft holders inside AMUs, MGs, TFs. They can seek **O-0 commissions** after two successful missions if they wish the leadership ladder.  
*Innovators* ideate inside the **Innovation Hub**; once an idea wins ‚ÄúGreen-light‚Äù they launch as a **discovery AMU** and pull an **O-0** lead (who may be the innovator).

---

### Summary ‚Äî The clarified lattice

1. **AMU ‚Üí MG ‚Üí TF ‚Üí SC ‚Üí LC** gives clean escalation of scope, money and risk.  
2. **Officer Corps** supplies portable command craft at every tier.  
3. **Venture definition:** inside Eupator a *Strategic Command*; outside, a *Spin-off*.  
4. **Notion implementation**: each node maps to a database row; all artifacts are sub-pages; officer rank stored as property for dashboards and permissions.

This delineation unifies execution, documentation and career architecture‚Äîallowing Eupator to expand from a single side-hustle to a constellation of spin-off companies while never losing coherency.
