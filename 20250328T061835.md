To leverage their small numbers while accumulating and using wealth as a tool for power, the Crystallines can establish a sophisticated and influential financial system. Here's an outline of key components and strategies they might employ:

1. **Central Bank and Currency Control**: Establish a central bank unique to the Crystallines that controls the issuance of their own currency. This bank could regulate monetary policy, manage interest rates, and stabilize the currency to make it attractive for international trade and investment.

2. **Global Banking Network**: Create a network of banks under Crystalline control in various key locations across the world. These banks can offer services like loans, savings, investment opportunities, and financial advice, attracting a wide range of clients.

3. **Investment and Wealth Management**: Develop investment funds and wealth management services that cater to high-net-worth individuals and entities from different races. By managing a significant portion of other races' wealth, the Crystallines can gain substantial influence.

4. **Strategic Lending and Credit Facilities**: Use lending and credit facilities strategically to influence the economies and politics of other regions. For instance, offering favorable loans to build infrastructure in exchange for access to resources or political alliances.

5. **Trade Financing**: Dominate trade financing, especially in critical and high-value commodities. Control over trade financing allows the Crystallines to influence international trade flows.

6. **Stock Exchanges and Financial Markets**: Establish and operate major stock exchanges and financial markets within their insulars or entry points. These financial centers can become hubs for global investment and economic activities.

7. **Financial Technology and Magical Integration**: Innovate in financial technology, integrating their magical prowess to offer unique and secure services like magically encrypted transactions, instant cross-world transfers, or magical contracts.

8. **Monetary Influence**: Utilize their wealth to buy influence, whether through funding political campaigns, backing certain economic policies, or investing in foreign enterprises that align with their interests.

9. **Economic Intelligence and Analysis**: Maintain a sophisticated system for economic intelligence and analysis, using this information to make informed decisions about where and how to invest or apply financial pressure.

10. **Fiscal Policies for Internal Development**: Implement fiscal policies that encourage internal economic growth, such as funding magical research, subsidizing key industries, or supporting infrastructure projects within the insulars.

By building a robust financial system and leveraging their wealth strategically, the Crystallines can extend their influence far beyond their physical numbers, using economic power to shape the world according to their interests and objectives.
